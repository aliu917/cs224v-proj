P a r t of the tribute was retained for his own use, and the remainder was transmitted to his overlord - the provincial governor. He adjudicated cases and disputes in the district, mobilized and commanded the local militia, and organized public works to develop the district (besides ensuring that his 'parish', often coterminous with the district, discharged its obligations to the local Ethiopian Orthodox church).$^{14}$ As a rule, the obligations due to the lord or church from the district's population, based primarily on their attachment to land for livelihood, were comparatively light in the Amhara-Tigre core provinces. There, land was owned and controlled by the rist system, that is, mostly by individual lineages; it was practically inalienable and was therefore unavailable for distribution by the emperor or governor for patronage purposes. The obligations were heavy in the regions in the south and west conquered by Menelik, where the lords and naftanyas (literally 'gunbearers': settlers from the Abyssinian highlands) greatly exploited the people partly through gult rights and obligations. 1 5"

The Italian officer in charge of the occupation, Rear-Admiral Caimi, proclaimed to the inhabitants that this action was taken in agreement with the British and Egyptians, and promised: 'No obstacle shall be put by me on your trade; on t h e contrary, all my exertions shall aim at facilitating it.'$^{41}$ This profession, however, rapidly proved worthless, for the Italians soon stopped the supply of arms to Yohannes, and penetrated inland as far as the villages of Sahati and Wia. Ras Alula protested against this infiltration, but the Italians replied by fortifying the disputed areas, and by sending more troops which were intercepted by Ras Alula at Dogali in January 1887. The invaders thereupon evacuated Sahati and Wia, but, complaining of a 'massacre' at Dogali, blockaded all s h i p i n g b r i n g i n g supplies to Ethiopia. 42",

They did so with the consent of the British who favoured Italian expansion in the hope of curbing that of France, their principal rival in the Scramble for Africa. The Italian officer in charge of the occupation, Rear-Admiral Caimi, proclaimed to the inhabitants that this action was taken in agreement with the British and Egyptians, and promised: 'No obstacle shall be put by me on your trade; on t h e contrary, all my exertions shall aim at facilitating it.'$^{41}$ This profession, however, rapidly proved worthless, for the Italians soon stopped the supply of arms to Yohannes, and penetrated inland as far as the villages of Sahati and Wia. Ras Alula protested against this infiltration, but the Italians replied by fortifying the disputed areas, and by sending more troops which were intercepted by Ras Alula at Dogali in January 1887. The invaders thereupon evacuated Sahati and Wia, but, complaining of a 'massacre' at Dogali, blockaded all s h i p i n g b r i n g i n g supplies to Ethiopia. 42"
