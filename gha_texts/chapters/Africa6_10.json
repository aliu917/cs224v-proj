The i m p a c t of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work. As a result, the Scottish Free Church plunged for the first time into missionary work in Central Africa. In 1875 i t sfirst e x p e d i t i o n penetrated the Zambezi and t h e Shire and p l a n t e d a station at Blantyre on Lake Nyasa. The o t h e r missionary societies already at work on the coast expanded their efforts rapidly. In 1875 the UMCA s t a r t e d a station at Magila on the mainland in what was part of Kimweri's empire of Usambara, and i n 1876 established a station in the southern region of Tanzania at Masasi. Meanwhile, Stanley, an Anglo-American journalist, adventurer and e x p l o r e , who h a d previously been commissioned to look for Livingstone, had completed a second journey to explore the region further. In 1875 h i s letter about the possibilities for missionary work in Buganda appeared in the Daily Telegraph. This stimulated a number of British churchmen to offer funds for missionary work. As a result, the CMS expanded from Freretown in Rabai near Mombasa and e s t a b l i s h ed a station at Mpwapwa in the middle of Tanzania in 1876 from where missionaries were able to reach Mutesa's capital the following year. Livingstone's o w n home society, the London Missionary Society, soon decided to follow his steps and, s t i m u l a t e d by a specific offer of funds, decided to go to Lake Tanganyika, the region where Livingstone spent his last years. From 1877 onwards the London Missionary Society established a number of stations near Lake Tanganyika; Ujiji, Urambo, Kavala Island and Mtowa. Unfortunately work at these stations had to be abandoned because the climate and German political interests proved too hostile for the missionaries. T h e Society eventually re-established its base in the British sphere of influence in Rhodesia."}, {"self_ref": "#/texts/231", "parent": {"$ref": "#/body"}, "children": [], "label": "text", "prov": [{"page_no": 33, "bbox": {"l": 54.75928497314453, "t": 165.04498291015625, "r": 387.6309814453125, "b": 72.5035400390625, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}, "charspan": [0, 605]}], "orig": "Unlike the Protestants, Roman Catholic missionary activities owed their stimulus during the same period to the vision and energies of one i n d i v d u a l , Cardinal Lavigerie, who w a s appointed the Archbishop of Algiers in 1 8 6 7 .
