## The Fanti Confederation represented an early form of organized governance and political organization among African societies.

The claim that the Fanti Confederation represented an early form of organized governance and political organization among African societies is well-supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The Fanti Confederation was an organized political entity with a constitution designed to unite various chiefs and kings for common purposes, such as defense, infrastructure development, education, and economic activities, indicating a structured approach to governance. It featured a representative assembly and an executive council, elements characteristic of organized governance. The African Times further highlights the Confederation's structured governance through the establishment of a committee, the election of a President and other officials, and the creation of a constitution with specific articles and objectives. The election of a King President and a General Field Marshal, along with annual meetings to discuss national welfare, underscores a systematic approach to governance. Procedural aspects such as the formation of quorums, the passing of laws, and the administration of oaths further illustrate its organized nature. Despite its short-lived existence due to British intervention, the Confederation's official recognition and the assignment of a temporary residence for its officers reflect its status as an organized political entity. Collectively, these details from both sources demonstrate that the Fanti Confederation was indeed an early form of organized governance and political organization within African societies.

* **New political trends**: Modernization also took place in the constitutional field. There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training. As Clause 22 put it, That normal schools
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: In the west, the Mankessim assembly, comprising Fante chiefs but also delegates from Denkyira, Wassa, Twifu and Assin, drafted three constitutions in succession.$^{9}$ The first came in 1868; the second, signed and sealed by thirty-one chiefs and kings in November 1871, instituted a kingpresident elected by his peers to preside over the national assembly made up of the chiefs. The representative assembly, for its part, made up of delegations of two members (a chief and a learned person) from each kingdom, was presided over by the vice-president, who also presided over the executive council. In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.
To the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate. Above all, however, the British did their utmost to repress intellectuals and divide the chiefs until the Fante Confederation collapsed.
* **New political trends**: The progressive and modern nature of the objectives of the Con› federation are truly astonishing while the spirit of harmonious co-operation between the educated elite and the traditional rulers pervading the Con› stitution was really revolutionary. Had this bold co-operative effort, which was very much inspired by the writings of Africanus Horton, been allowed to materialize and the plans implemented, the course not only of the history of the Gold Coast but probably the whole of British West Africa would have been different. But for reasons to be discussed later, the British had killed this bold and interesting initiative stone-dead by 1873. 59 A similar constitutional experiment was that of the Egba United Board of Management formed at Abeokuta. According to Africanus Horton, its express purpose was that 'of directing the native government, of forwarding civilization, and promoting the spread of Christianity, as well as of pro- tecting the property of European merchants and British subjects'.$^{60}$ A third example was the constitution for the kingdom of the Grebo, which, as Person points out, was set up in imitation of the Fante Confederation.
It should be evident from all this that in the political as in the religious and demographic fields, really fundamental changes were taking place and the roots of many of the basic issues of today - the relationship between the educated elite and the traditional rulers, the problems of socio-economic development, the idea of political independence, the concept and practice of pan-Africanism and the phenomenon of racial discrimination - can be found during the period under review.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance. It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.
In 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.
Asante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat). He was arrested by ruse in 1896 at the time of the rush for colonial territory and deported.

* **FANTI CONFEDERATION**: Sir,—The great meeting took place here, the 30th July last. It was composed principally of kings, chiefs, captains, head men, &c., and was presided over by Captain Ackiney, King of Aicomfie. The resolutions of the said kings, chiefs, &c., were as follows:—

That, subject to the approval by the British Government of the Constitution, &c., of the Fanti Confederation—

1. Inasie Adoo, of Mankessim, shall be King President of the whole Fanti nation.

2. That Anfoo Otoo, of Abboorah, shall be General Field Marshal of the Fanti nation.

3. That all the kings, chiefs, &c., shall meet annually at Mankessim, to discuss all matters having relation to the welfare of the Fanti nation.

The kings and chiefs who, through Mr. Salmon's threats and persecutions, had some time ago repudiated all connection with the Fanti Confederation, have since come to Mankessim, and taken the Oath of Allegiance to the Confederation. They have also subscribed by their names and marks to the Constitution of the Confederation.

We are all anxiously waiting to know what Her Majesty's Government will decide about the Confederation and its Constitution, as no useful action can be taken till we have Her Majesty's approval.—Yours truly,
* **The Fanti Confederation, its Constitution, and Acting-Administrator Salmon**: whom we believe destined to achieve great good in Fanti. True Gothic House had the misfortune to be a Government prison, and their appointed attendants were jailors; but they were equal to the occasion, and accepted the magnificent accommodation of Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's drawing-rooms,* with a dignity that will long redound to their honour. We feel that the whole of Fanti, every educated African within its borders, every king and chief, the entire people, owe a debt of gratitude to these worthy representatives. Had they flinched before the brutal bellowings and arbitrary measures of an unworthily held authority; they would have greatly compromised the cause of Fanti advancement? It has been often asserted to us that the Fanti Confederation was but a rope of tow, which would snap in sunder so soon as the hand of protective authority on the Coast should deign to touch it rudely; that its members, and more especially its educated ones, would sell one another, betray one another, abandon one another, under the bribes, threats, or cajolery of administrative power; and that every attempt to form a strong native organisation for interior governmental co-operation with the Coast authority, would be futile. Fact has grandly disproved such assertions. True there have been some, it is said, who deserted and denied their brethren, and some who tempted them to mutual betrayal. But although this, like every other great national cause, has had weak members, and power has here as elsewhere not found it difficult to enlist spies and would-be denouncers, the steady firmness of Davidson, Brew, and Amissah, and the unyielding dignity of the kings at Mankessim, have cast that weakness and that wickedness so deeply into shade, that we do not care to trouble ourselves with any further allusions to it. It is always well that the supposed adherents of a new national organisation should be tried and sifted. It is never to be looked for among human agents that the wheat should be without some admixture of chaff; which is only blown away by the wind of seeming peril; and what has happened was, perhaps, necessary to teach the Confederation caution as to its officers and agents, that it may not be misrepresented, deserted, and injured by unworthy ones. We think it deserves great praise for the constitution it has given to itself, the whole of which we print verbatim in this number of our journal. There is certainly nothing in it to justify Mr. Salmon's wrath; and we cannot but think that if it had been submitted to him at early morning, instead of after his Excellency! (save the mark!) had dined, the reception of its bearers would have been of a different character to that which they experienced; and Gothic House would never have acquired historic fame, as connected with the constitution of the Fanti Confederation. The course pursued by us in vindication of the rights and liberties of the Fanti people, and in behalf of Fanti advancement, so soon as we received intelligence of Mr. Salmon's atrociously arbitrary and ridiculous official misconduct, will be seen in the letters addressed by us to the Right. Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and we shall not attempt to indicate what the result of our efforts will or ought to be. It should appear to his lordship, as it seems in our eyes, that in that consolidating act of the Fanti Confederation, the drawing up of that constitution at Mankessim, there is really the birth of a nation, which requires only judicious, enlightened, and Christian guidance, education, and support (such as Great Britain is well calculated to give) during the earlier period of its life, to make it a great instrument of good in West Africa, we feel sure that he will so represent the matter to the other members of the Government in Council, that there will not be any attempt under an administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head, to strangle or dwarf what ought to be nursed and assisted to expand. The education of the children, male and female, throughout Fanti; the opening and maintenance of roads; the development of the vast agricultural and mineral resources of the countries of the Confederation, are objects which must commend themselves to the heart and mind of every member of an enlightened government; and as they are objects that could not by any possibility be attained and achieved without such national movement and co-operation as may be secured through the instrumentality of the Fanti Confederation, we feel no misgiving as to the course that will be pursued by the Earl of Kimberley, in dealing with matters so interesting, and of so much magnitude and importance.
* **CONSTITUTION OF THE FANTI CONFEDERATION.**: **ARTICLE XXXIX.**—That three of the ex-officio members of the Executive Council, or two ex-officio and two non-official members, shall form a quorum of said Council and be competent to deliberate on all matters laid before it for consideration by the Secretary or Under-Secretary or any other member thereof.

**ARTICLE XL.**—That one third of the members composing the Representative Assembly shall form a quorum to discuss and deliberate on all questions brought before said Assembly.

**ARTICLE XLI.**—That all laws, bills, resolutions, ordinances, &c., be carried by the majority of votes in the Representative Assembly or Executive Council; in the latter the Vice-President possessing a casting vote.

**ARTICLE XLII.**—That it be the duty of the National Assembly, held in October of each year—

Section 1.—To elect from the body of kings the President for the ensuing year, and to re-elect as often as may appear to it fit and proper the out-going President.

Section 2.—To consider all programmes laid before it by the Executive Council.

Section 3.—To place on the "stool" in cases of disputed succession thereto the person elected by the Executive Council, with the concurrence of the principal inhabitants of the town, croon, or district.

**ARTICLE XLIII.**—That the officers of the Confederation shall render assistance as directed by the Executive in carrying out the wishes of the British Government.

**ARTICLE XLIV.**—That it be competent to the Representative Assembly, for the purpose of carrying on the administration of the Government, to pass laws, &c., for levying of such taxes as to it may seem necessary.

**ARTICLE XLV.**—That all the articles herein above passed be designated the Constitution of the Fanti Confederation.

**ARTICLE XLVI.**—That oaths of allegiance to the Fanti Confederation be taken by the kings and principal chiefs, which shall be binding on their subjects and peoples, as well as by the principal officers of the Confederation and others joining it.

**ARTICLE XLVII.**—That the following oaths, in conjunction with that peculiar to each province, be administered as soon as the Constitution becomes law, to all the kings and chiefs present, their captains and headmen, to the educated persons who express a wish to join the Confederation and to all the office-bearers:—

**No. 1.—Form of oath to be administered to the King President.**

I swear that I will well, truly, and faithfully, serve my country, and in the capacity of King President maintain the Constitution of the Fanti Confederation; and that I will not conceal any apparent danger, damage, or harm which may be likely or possible to arise, without giving, or causing to be given, speedy notice thereof; and that I will truly, faithfully, and disinterestedly endeavour to use calm and peaceable means to quell any and every disturbance that may arise in any part of the Confederation. So help me God.

**No. 2.—Oath of allegiance to the King President.**
* **The Fanti Confederation, its Constitution, and Acting-Administrator Salmon**: The Fanti Confederation is now a ripening, as well as an established fact. It has struggled through a stormy but useful infancy; has formed its constitution; has held its first assembly under that constitution; has elected its officers; has officially notified its existence and organisation to the representative of supreme authority, for the information and approval of that authority; and its officers have had Gothic House, Cape Coast, assigned to them as a temporary residence; where, by a still further beneficent exercise of power, the Acting Administrator brought five of their most intimate friends to rejoice with them, at the now seemingly assured growth of the new giant baby,

## The Fanti Confederation aimed to enhance education and infrastructure, indicating a forward-thinking approach to nation-building.

The claim that the Fanti Confederation aimed to enhance education and infrastructure, indicating a forward-thinking approach to nation-building, is well-supported by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the Confederation's objectives as outlined in its Constitution, which included establishing schools for educating children, promoting industrial training, and developing infrastructure such as roads. These initiatives underscore a progressive and modern approach to nation-building, with a focus on education for both sexes and substantial road construction, as well as cooperation between the educated elite and traditional rulers. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the Confederation's goals to erect school-houses, establish educational institutions, and build roads throughout the interior districts, aligning with the claim of enhancing education and infrastructure. The articles further highlight the Confederation's commitment to improving social and political conditions, reinforcing its progressive vision. Although challenges faced by the Confederation are noted, these only serve to underscore its resilience and potential for positive impact. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the Fanti Confederation's forward-thinking approach to nation-building through its focus on education and infrastructure development.

The education of the children, male and female, throughout Fanti; the opening and maintenance of roads; the development of the vast agricultural and mineral resources of the countries of the Confederation, are objects which must commend themselves to the heart and mind of every member of an enlightened government; and as they are objects that could not by any possibility be attained and achieved without such national movement and co-operation as may be secured through the instrumentality of the Fanti Confederation, we feel no misgiving as to the course that will be pursued by the Earl of Kimberley, in dealing with matters so interesting, and of so much magnitude and importance.

## The Confederation sought to establish economic self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on external powers.

The claim that the Fante Confederation sought to establish economic self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on external powers is partially supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa highlights the Confederation's efforts to raise an army, set up institutions, and levy taxes, indicating a move towards self-governance and economic organization. However, the Confederation's 1872 amendment to seek recognition and financial support from the British government suggests a reliance on external powers, contradicting the claim of seeking economic self-sufficiency. Additionally, while the Confederation's progressive objectives and cooperation between the educated elite and traditional rulers imply a desire for self-sufficiency, British suppression indicates external interference. The African Times supports the claim by highlighting the Confederation's objectives to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and develop the country's resources, aligning with economic self-sufficiency. However, the articles focus more on internal development and improvement rather than explicitly stating a reduction in external dependency. Overall, while there are elements of striving for self-sufficiency, the Confederation's reliance on British recognition and support complicates the claim of reducing reliance on external powers.

* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: In the west, the Mankessim assembly, comprising Fante chiefs but also delegates from Denkyira, Wassa, Twifu and Assin, drafted three constitutions in succession.$^{9}$ The first came in 1868; the second, signed and sealed by thirty-one chiefs and kings in November 1871, instituted a kingpresident elected by his peers to preside over the national assembly made up of the chiefs. The representative assembly, for its part, made up of delegations of two members (a chief and a learned person) from each kingdom, was presided over by the vice-president, who also presided over the executive council. In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.
To the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate. Above all, however, the British did their utmost to repress intellectuals and divide the chiefs until the Fante Confederation collapsed.
* **New political trends**: The progressive and modern nature of the objectives of the Con› federation are truly astonishing while the spirit of harmonious co-operation between the educated elite and the traditional rulers pervading the Con› stitution was really revolutionary. Had this bold co-operative effort, which was very much inspired by the writings of Africanus Horton, been allowed to materialize and the plans implemented, the course not only of the history of the Gold Coast but probably the whole of British West Africa would have been different. But for reasons to be discussed later, the British had killed this bold and interesting initiative stone-dead by 1873. 59 A similar constitutional experiment was that of the Egba United Board of Management formed at Abeokuta. According to Africanus Horton, its express purpose was that 'of directing the native government, of forwarding civilization, and promoting the spread of Christianity, as well as of pro- tecting the property of European merchants and British subjects'.$^{60}$ A third example was the constitution for the kingdom of the Grebo, which, as Person points out, was set up in imitation of the Fante Confederation.
It should be evident from all this that in the political as in the religious and demographic fields, really fundamental changes were taking place and the roots of many of the basic issues of today - the relationship between the educated elite and the traditional rulers, the problems of socio-economic development, the idea of political independence, the concept and practice of pan-Africanism and the phenomenon of racial discrimination - can be found during the period under review.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Social change**: They were employed as clerks at wretched wages or, unemployed, were reduced to travelling about through the bush as brokers for English or African merchants. They were regarded with contempt as caricatures of English civilization, living as parasites on illiterate chiefs and their peoples. Between these two extremes stood those Africans who, without becoming highly learned, had nevertheless received a sufficiently good education to be able to become independent merchants or managers in the coastal towns.$^{64}$ In this way the bases for subsequent social contradictions were laid. Nevertheless, it should be noted that it was the cooperation between the educated entrepreneurial class that made the Fante Confederation possible.

## The Fanti Confederation was a response to external pressures and conflicts, particularly from European colonial powers.

The claim that the Fanti Confederation was a response to external pressures and conflicts, particularly from European colonial powers, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa highlights that the Fanti Confederation was a significant protest against the encroaching colonialism on the Gold Coast, aiming to restore Fanti unity disrupted by European influences. This suggests that the Confederation was indeed a reaction to external pressures from European colonial powers, with the educated elite playing a crucial role in guiding traditional leaders, thus using the colonial education system as a tool for resistance. However, it focuses more on the protest against colonialism rather than specific conflicts. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed accounts of the events leading to the formation of the Fanti Confederation, emphasizing the opposition of the Fanti and allied tribes to the transfer of control to the Dutch and their subsequent military actions, such as the blockade of Elmina and the Dutch bombardment of Commendah. The involvement of British officials like Mr. Ussher and Mr. Simpson further illustrates the external pressures faced by the Fantis. The formation of the Fanti Confederation at Mankessim and its recognition by Mr. Simpson as the "Fanti Confederacy" indicate a structured response to these pressures, underscoring the Confederation's emergence as a reaction to the coercive actions of European colonial powers, specifically the Dutch and the British, and the need for self-governance and protection against external threats. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the Fanti Confederation as a response to both the overarching colonial pressures and specific conflicts instigated by European powers.

* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance. It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.
In 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.
Asante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat). He was arrested by ruse in 1896 at the time of the rush for colonial territory and deported.

The Dutch bombarded Commendah, and as these tribes were the natural allies of the Fantis, they were compelled to take the field on their behalf. The Fantis took a large force to the seat of war, and, together with these other tribes, besieged and blockaded Elmina, the head-quarters of the Dutch possessions on the Coast of Guinea. This was in the early part of 1868. At this time Mr. Ussher held the reins of government, and by active measures succeeded in inducing the Fantis to raise the blockade and retire. The kings and chiefs of Fanti, and their allies, proceeded direct to Mankessim, and there laid the foundation of the Fanti Confederation. Whilst they were there assembled Mr. Ussher addressed a letter, of date 18th July, 1868, "to the Presidents and other chiefs of Fanti at Mankessim," in which, after dwelling on various circumstances connected with the Elmina war, he proceeded to state: "Your conduct has been such that I can no longer have any relations with you;" and "as you voluntarily throw off your allegiance, you must not be surprised that I accept your act, and treat you, until you come to your senses, as apart from Great Britain;" further, that "in case of a war with Ashanti, as you will have provoked it, you will bear the brunt thereof without help from Government." Mr. Ussher shortly afterwards leaves for England, and Mr. Simpson becomes the chief of the Executive. Mr. Simpson follows closely in Mr. Ussher's footsteps, until he realises the fact that unless the rupture between the Government and the Fantis be healed up the progress of the country would be materially retarded.

With this in view, he proceeds to meet the kings and chiefs at Mankessim, in 1869, and there recognises the Fanti Confederation, by giving it himself the style and designation of the "Fanti Confederacy;" at the same time recognises and approves of the appointment of its principal officers, and acknowledges its authority over the interior districts of the protectorate. On Mr. Simpson's return to Cape Coast he had to seek the interference and mediation of the Confederation, for the purpose of ransoming certain Dutch naval officers and sailors who had been captured by the Commendahs; and the treaty, convention, or whatever one may choose to term it, as regards the ransom so to be paid to the Commendahs, through the Fanti Confederation, was ratified by Mr. R.

* **Innocency of the Fanti Confederation**: IV. Appealing, then, to reason, Mr. Editor, I see no bitterness that could have been dictated by the impulse of that season, being told to fight our own battles; protection not extending beyond the reach of a cannon ball from the forts. Many indications of this nature being previously given, and the interchanges crowning everything, by the giving over to our enemies our brethren and allied tribes, one quite dead even would be aroused by this to seek his interest. Mr. Editor, observe, also, the care taken to show no disloyalty on this occasion, which is perceivable from the drift of the given accounts. The opinion had no deviation from the idea implanted in us, of training us for eventual self-government. And if our gracious Queen's Government has not warred this intention concerning us, I see, then, no reason why encouragement ought not to be given to a Confederation like what we have been trying to have established, especially when no intimation has been given us yet of this intention being changed. I beg, therefore, to say, that none but one unacquainted with the habits of the Fantis would disrecommend such association.

## The Fanti Confederation's formation was an attempt at self-governance and resistance to colonial rule.

The claim that the Fanti Confederation's formation was an attempt at self-governance and resistance to colonial rule is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the Confederation as a political entity that sought self-governance through a constitution and a representative assembly, indicating efforts towards self-governance. It also notes the Confederation's attempt to gain recognition from the British government, suggesting resistance to colonial rule by asserting political legitimacy. The textbook further describes the Confederation as a protest against colonialism and an effort to recapture Fante unity, emphasizing resistance to the divisive effects of European presence. Additionally, it mentions constitutional modernization efforts aimed at uniting chiefs for common defense and promoting education and infrastructure, aligning with self-governance initiatives. Similarly, The African Times details the initial opposition of the Fanti and their allies to the Dutch transfer and their subsequent military actions, leading to the Confederation's formation. This suggests a move towards self-governance as they organized independently of British authority. The articles discuss the desire for self-government due to the lack of British protection, indicating a motivation for self-reliance. They also highlight the formal establishment of the Confederation, its constitution, and its recognition by the British representative, aligning with self-governance. While explicit resistance to colonial rule is not directly stated in The African Times, it can be inferred from the context. Together, these sources illustrate that the Fanti Confederation was indeed an attempt at self-governance and resistance to colonial rule.

* **New political trends**: Modernization also took place in the constitutional field. There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training. As Clause 22 put it, That normal schools

J. Ghartey, as the representative or President thereof, and by Mr. Simpson, for the British Government, and Governor Nagglas, on behalf of the Netherlands.

The kings and chiefs of Fanti, as soon as they heard of the proposed exchange, convened a meeting at Mankessim, and there entered into a solemn compact to render every assistance to their fellow-countrymen, should the Dutch attempt to coerce them into "accepting the Dutch flag." The Dutch bombarded Commendah, and as these tribes were the natural allies of the Fantis, they were compelled to take the field on their behalf. The Fantis took a large force to the seat of war, and, together with these other tribes, besieged and blockaded Elmina, the head-quarters of the Dutch possessions on the Coast of Guinea. This was in the early part of 1868. At this time Mr. Ussher held the reins of government, and by active measures succeeded in inducing the Fantis to raise the blockade and retire. The kings and chiefs of Fanti, and their allies, proceeded direct to Mankessim, and there laid the foundation of the Fanti Confederation. Whilst they were there assembled Mr. Ussher addressed a letter, of date 18th July, 1868, "to the Presidents and other chiefs of Fanti at Mankessim," in which, after dwelling on various circumstances connected with the Elmina war, he proceeded to state: "Your conduct has been such that I can no longer have any relations with you;" and "as you voluntarily throw off your allegiance, you must not be surprised that I accept your act, and treat you, until you come to your senses, as apart from Great Britain;" further, that "in case of a war with Ashanti, as you will have provoked it, you will bear the brunt thereof without help from Government." Mr. Ussher shortly afterwards leaves for England, and Mr. Simpson becomes the chief of the Executive. Mr. Simpson follows closely in Mr. Ussher's footsteps, until he realises the fact that unless the rupture between the Government and the Fantis be healed up the progress of the country would be materially retarded.

## The British colonial administration's response to the Fanti Confederation was mixed, highlighting tensions between colonial powers and African political entities.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced understanding of the British colonial administration's response to the Fanti Confederation, highlighting the tensions between colonial powers and African political entities. The General History of Africa describes the Fanti Confederation as a progressive initiative that was ultimately suppressed by the British by 1873, indicating a negative response and underscoring the antagonism of colonial governments towards the educated African elite, which foreshadowed future tensions. This aligns with the claim by illustrating the British suppression of the Confederation and the underlying tensions, though it lacks explicit evidence of any supportive response from the British. In contrast, The African Times provides evidence of a mixed response, initially marked by Mr. Ussher's strong opposition and severance of relations with the Confederation, reflecting tension and a lack of support. However, a shift occurred with Mr. Simpson's succession, as he recognized the Confederation and sought its cooperation, indicating a more conciliatory approach. This change highlights the mixed response from the British administration. Additionally, the article discusses the challenges faced by the Confederation, including skepticism about its stability and potential betrayal, reflecting broader tensions. It also suggests that the Confederation was seen as a potential positive force for development in West Africa, aligning with British interests if supported properly. Together, these sources illustrate both opposition and eventual recognition from the British, highlighting the complexities and tensions in their interactions with African political entities.

* **New political trends**: The progressive and modern nature of the objectives of the Con› federation are truly astonishing while the spirit of harmonious co-operation between the educated elite and the traditional rulers pervading the Con› stitution was really revolutionary. Had this bold co-operative effort, which was very much inspired by the writings of Africanus Horton, been allowed to materialize and the plans implemented, the course not only of the history of the Gold Coast but probably the whole of British West Africa would have been different. But for reasons to be discussed later, the British had killed this bold and interesting initiative stone-dead by 1873. 59 A similar constitutional experiment was that of the Egba United Board of Management formed at Abeokuta. According to Africanus Horton, its express purpose was that 'of directing the native government, of forwarding civilization, and promoting the spread of Christianity, as well as of pro- tecting the property of European merchants and British subjects'.$^{60}$ A third example was the constitution for the kingdom of the Grebo, which, as Person points out, was set up in imitation of the Fante Confederation.
It should be evident from all this that in the political as in the religious and demographic fields, really fundamental changes were taking place and the roots of many of the basic issues of today - the relationship between the educated elite and the traditional rulers, the problems of socio-economic development, the idea of political independence, the concept and practice of pan-Africanism and the phenomenon of racial discrimination - can be found during the period under review.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance. It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.
In 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.
Asante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat). He was arrested by ruse in 1896 at the time of the rush for colonial territory and deported.

* **The Fanti Confederation, its Constitution, and Acting-Administrator Salmon**: whom we believe destined to achieve great good in Fanti. True Gothic House had the misfortune to be a Government prison, and their appointed attendants were jailors; but they were equal to the occasion, and accepted the magnificent accommodation of Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's drawing-rooms,* with a dignity that will long redound to their honour. We feel that the whole of Fanti, every educated African within its borders, every king and chief, the entire people, owe a debt of gratitude to these worthy representatives. Had they flinched before the brutal bellowings and arbitrary measures of an unworthily held authority; they would have greatly compromised the cause of Fanti advancement? It has been often asserted to us that the Fanti Confederation was but a rope of tow, which would snap in sunder so soon as the hand of protective authority on the Coast should deign to touch it rudely; that its members, and more especially its educated ones, would sell one another, betray one another, abandon one another, under the bribes, threats, or cajolery of administrative power; and that every attempt to form a strong native organisation for interior governmental co-operation with the Coast authority, would be futile. Fact has grandly disproved such assertions. True there have been some, it is said, who deserted and denied their brethren, and some who tempted them to mutual betrayal. But although this, like every other great national cause, has had weak members, and power has here as elsewhere not found it difficult to enlist spies and would-be denouncers, the steady firmness of Davidson, Brew, and Amissah, and the unyielding dignity of the kings at Mankessim, have cast that weakness and that wickedness so deeply into shade, that we do not care to trouble ourselves with any further allusions to it. It is always well that the supposed adherents of a new national organisation should be tried and sifted. It is never to be looked for among human agents that the wheat should be without some admixture of chaff; which is only blown away by the wind of seeming peril; and what has happened was, perhaps, necessary to teach the Confederation caution as to its officers and agents, that it may not be misrepresented, deserted, and injured by unworthy ones. We think it deserves great praise for the constitution it has given to itself, the whole of which we print verbatim in this number of our journal. There is certainly nothing in it to justify Mr. Salmon's wrath; and we cannot but think that if it had been submitted to him at early morning, instead of after his Excellency! (save the mark!) had dined, the reception of its bearers would have been of a different character to that which they experienced; and Gothic House would never have acquired historic fame, as connected with the constitution of the Fanti Confederation. The course pursued by us in vindication of the rights and liberties of the Fanti people, and in behalf of Fanti advancement, so soon as we received intelligence of Mr. Salmon's atrociously arbitrary and ridiculous official misconduct, will be seen in the letters addressed by us to the Right. Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and we shall not attempt to indicate what the result of our efforts will or ought to be. It should appear to his lordship, as it seems in our eyes, that in that consolidating act of the Fanti Confederation, the drawing up of that constitution at Mankessim, there is really the birth of a nation, which requires only judicious, enlightened, and Christian guidance, education, and support (such as Great Britain is well calculated to give) during the earlier period of its life, to make it a great instrument of good in West Africa, we feel sure that he will so represent the matter to the other members of the Government in Council, that there will not be any attempt under an administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head, to strangle or dwarf what ought to be nursed and assisted to expand. The education of the children, male and female, throughout Fanti; the opening and maintenance of roads; the development of the vast agricultural and mineral resources of the countries of the Confederation, are objects which must commend themselves to the heart and mind of every member of an enlightened government; and as they are objects that could not by any possibility be attained and achieved without such national movement and co-operation as may be secured through the instrumentality of the Fanti Confederation, we feel no misgiving as to the course that will be pursued by the Earl of Kimberley, in dealing with matters so interesting, and of so much magnitude and importance.

## The Fanti Confederation's efforts in education, infrastructure, and resource management were seen as essential for regional advancement.

The claim that the Fanti Confederation's efforts in education, infrastructure, and resource management were seen as essential for regional advancement is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa highlights the Confederation's objectives, which included establishing schools, constructing substantial roads, and developing agricultural and industrial pursuits, all aimed at promoting education and industrial training. This aligns with the claim of regional advancement, as detailed in paragraphs [0], [2], and [3]. The text also notes the progressive nature of these objectives and the cooperation between the educated elite and traditional rulers, although it acknowledges the suppression of these initiatives by the British, indicating external challenges. Similarly, The African Times outlines the Confederation's objectives in paragraphs [0] and [2], emphasizing the erection of school-houses, road construction, and resource management as crucial for regional progress. It suggests that these efforts were seen as essential by an enlightened government and highlights the Confederation's potential as a significant instrument of good in West Africa. Both sources consistently emphasize the importance of these initiatives for the region's development, despite the challenges faced.

* **New political trends**: Modernization also took place in the constitutional field. There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training. As Clause 22 put it, That normal schools

The education of the children, male and female, throughout Fanti; the opening and maintenance of roads; the development of the vast agricultural and mineral resources of the countries of the Confederation, are objects which must commend themselves to the heart and mind of every member of an enlightened government; and as they are objects that could not by any possibility be attained and achieved without such national movement and co-operation as may be secured through the instrumentality of the Fanti Confederation, we feel no misgiving as to the course that will be pursued by the Earl of Kimberley, in dealing with matters so interesting, and of so much magnitude and importance.

## The Fanti Confederation's constitution and governance structure may have served as a model for later African nationalist movements.

The Fanti Confederation's constitution and governance structure are highlighted in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times as significant in the context of African self-governance and potential inspiration for later nationalist movements. The General History of Africa emphasizes the Confederation's progressive objectives, such as promoting education, infrastructure, and economic development, which align with the goals of later African nationalist movements. It notes the Confederation's emphasis on cooperation between the educated elite and traditional rulers, foreshadowing the role of educated elites in future movements. However, the textbook stops short of explicitly stating that the Confederation served as a direct model for later movements, instead portraying it as an early example of resistance to colonialism that may have inspired future efforts. The African Times, on the other hand, underscores the significance of the Confederation's constitution as a potential model for governance and national organization, highlighting its structured approach, including the formation of a National Assembly and the election of a President. While it acknowledges the Confederation's cooperation with the British Government, which contrasts with the more anti-colonial stance of later movements, it suggests that the Confederation's resilience and capacity for self-governance could indeed have served as inspiration. Together, these observations suggest that while the Fanti Confederation's constitution and governance structure exhibit characteristics that could have influenced later nationalist movements, they also reflect a unique historical context that included cooperation with colonial authorities.

* **New political trends**: The progressive and modern nature of the objectives of the Con› federation are truly astonishing while the spirit of harmonious co-operation between the educated elite and the traditional rulers pervading the Con› stitution was really revolutionary. Had this bold co-operative effort, which was very much inspired by the writings of Africanus Horton, been allowed to materialize and the plans implemented, the course not only of the history of the Gold Coast but probably the whole of British West Africa would have been different. But for reasons to be discussed later, the British had killed this bold and interesting initiative stone-dead by 1873. 59 A similar constitutional experiment was that of the Egba United Board of Management formed at Abeokuta. According to Africanus Horton, its express purpose was that 'of directing the native government, of forwarding civilization, and promoting the spread of Christianity, as well as of pro- tecting the property of European merchants and British subjects'.$^{60}$ A third example was the constitution for the kingdom of the Grebo, which, as Person points out, was set up in imitation of the Fante Confederation.
It should be evident from all this that in the political as in the religious and demographic fields, really fundamental changes were taking place and the roots of many of the basic issues of today - the relationship between the educated elite and the traditional rulers, the problems of socio-economic development, the idea of political independence, the concept and practice of pan-Africanism and the phenomenon of racial discrimination - can be found during the period under review.
* **New political trends**: Modernization also took place in the constitutional field. There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training. As Clause 22 put it, That normal schools
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: In the west, the Mankessim assembly, comprising Fante chiefs but also delegates from Denkyira, Wassa, Twifu and Assin, drafted three constitutions in succession.$^{9}$ The first came in 1868; the second, signed and sealed by thirty-one chiefs and kings in November 1871, instituted a kingpresident elected by his peers to preside over the national assembly made up of the chiefs. The representative assembly, for its part, made up of delegations of two members (a chief and a learned person) from each kingdom, was presided over by the vice-president, who also presided over the executive council. In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.
To the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate. Above all, however, the British did their utmost to repress intellectuals and divide the chiefs until the Fante Confederation collapsed.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance. It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.
In 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.
Asante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat). He was arrested by ruse in 1896 at the time of the rush for colonial territory and deported.

* **The Fanti Confederation, its Constitution, and Acting-Administrator Salmon**: whom we believe destined to achieve great good in Fanti. True Gothic House had the misfortune to be a Government prison, and their appointed attendants were jailors; but they were equal to the occasion, and accepted the magnificent accommodation of Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's drawing-rooms,* with a dignity that will long redound to their honour. We feel that the whole of Fanti, every educated African within its borders, every king and chief, the entire people, owe a debt of gratitude to these worthy representatives. Had they flinched before the brutal bellowings and arbitrary measures of an unworthily held authority; they would have greatly compromised the cause of Fanti advancement? It has been often asserted to us that the Fanti Confederation was but a rope of tow, which would snap in sunder so soon as the hand of protective authority on the Coast should deign to touch it rudely; that its members, and more especially its educated ones, would sell one another, betray one another, abandon one another, under the bribes, threats, or cajolery of administrative power; and that every attempt to form a strong native organisation for interior governmental co-operation with the Coast authority, would be futile. Fact has grandly disproved such assertions. True there have been some, it is said, who deserted and denied their brethren, and some who tempted them to mutual betrayal. But although this, like every other great national cause, has had weak members, and power has here as elsewhere not found it difficult to enlist spies and would-be denouncers, the steady firmness of Davidson, Brew, and Amissah, and the unyielding dignity of the kings at Mankessim, have cast that weakness and that wickedness so deeply into shade, that we do not care to trouble ourselves with any further allusions to it. It is always well that the supposed adherents of a new national organisation should be tried and sifted. It is never to be looked for among human agents that the wheat should be without some admixture of chaff; which is only blown away by the wind of seeming peril; and what has happened was, perhaps, necessary to teach the Confederation caution as to its officers and agents, that it may not be misrepresented, deserted, and injured by unworthy ones.

## The Fanti Confederation's relationship with the British Government reflects the complexities of colonial relationships and strategic alliances.

The relationship between the Fanti Confederation and the British Government exemplifies the complexities of colonial relationships and strategic alliances, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa notes the Confederation's initial efforts to gain legitimacy through British recognition and financial support, indicating a strategic alliance with the colonial power. However, British actions, such as repressing intellectuals and dividing chiefs, ultimately led to the Confederation's collapse, showcasing the challenges of such alliances. The Confederation's progressive objectives and potential regional impact were thwarted by British intervention, reflecting the intricate dynamics where promising local initiatives were often undermined by colonial powers. The Confederation also served as a protest against colonialism, foreshadowing the educated elite's future involvement in governance, highlighting the complex interplay between local aspirations and colonial interests. Similarly, The African Times emphasizes the Confederation's dependency on British approval for its Constitution, reflecting the power dynamics inherent in colonial relationships. The anxiety of Confederation members regarding British decisions underscores this dependency. The necessity of British recognition and support for effective functioning illustrates the strategic alliance aspect, where cooperation was sought to avoid conflict and ensure progress. Additionally, the lack of clear regulations between the Fantis and the British suggests a complex and perhaps strained relationship. Together, these observations illustrate the multifaceted nature of the Fanti Confederation's interactions with the British, marked by both strategic cooperation and eventual suppression.

* **FANTI CONFEDERATION**: Sir,—The great meeting took place here, the 30th July last. It was composed principally of kings, chiefs, captains, head men, &c., and was presided over by Captain Ackiney, King of Aicomfie. The resolutions of the said kings, chiefs, &c., were as follows:—

That, subject to the approval by the British Government of the Constitution, &c., of the Fanti Confederation—

1. Inasie Adoo, of Mankessim, shall be King President of the whole Fanti nation.

2. That Anfoo Otoo, of Abboorah, shall be General Field Marshal of the Fanti nation.

3. That all the kings, chiefs, &c., shall meet annually at Mankessim, to discuss all matters having relation to the welfare of the Fanti nation.

The kings and chiefs who, through Mr. Salmon's threats and persecutions, had some time ago repudiated all connection with the Fanti Confederation, have since come to Mankessim, and taken the Oath of Allegiance to the Confederation. They have also subscribed by their names and marks to the Constitution of the Confederation.

We are all anxiously waiting to know what Her Majesty's Government will decide about the Confederation and its Constitution, as no useful action can be taken till we have Her Majesty's approval.—Yours truly,
* **Important Fanti Confederation Papers and Correspondence**: That letter, your Excellency will perceive, is signed by many of the kings who did not sign the Constitution, they not being at Mankessim at the time it was framed and passed, and who, Mr. Salmon says, repudiate any connection with us. We have omitted to state that one of the kings, Ackenning of Eckoomee, when called upon to disown connection with the kings and chiefs at Mankessim, declined to do so, but was subsequently compelled by pressure so to do.

Mr. Usher arrived here on the 3rd or 4th of March last, and again resumed the reins of office, and a few days after his arrival issued the proclamation we laid before your Excellency on the 11th instant. So much for this part of our subject, which has been brought to your notice with the view of showing to your Excellency that the existing state of affairs has not been brought about through disloyalty towards Her Majesty's Government, but that the position has been forced upon us.

We have now to deal with the most important questions, and shall endeavour to discuss them as clearly as possible; and we now lay them before your Excellency for submission to the Home Government, and its approval.

1. In the first place, for the Fanti Confederation to be of real practical use in the amelioration, development, and civilization of the country, it must have the recognition, countenance, support, and hearty co-operation of Her Majesty's Government, and its friendly aid and advice.

We do not for one single moment pretend to be able to carry on a government in the interior without such recognition and assistance; for without that the interests of both might clash, and a collision with the Local Government could not in any way further our object, and could have but one result—the breaking up of the Confederation, and the checking of all further progress towards the material improvement of the country for some years. It is, therefore, imperative that the Confederation should have such recognition and co-operation, and that the Local Government should not, by intrigue or other devices, endeavour to sow dissension amongst the members of the Confederation, and should not countenance, uphold, or protect any king or chief, or other person, who has once joined the Confederation, in any acts or deeds against its laws and customs.

2. That the jurisdiction of the Fanti Confederation shall be recognised and acknowledged to extend and be exercised in and over all tribes, peoples, provinces, or districts choosing to join it; and that its authority and jurisdiction, and that of the Local Government, be clearly and strictly defined in judicial and other matters.
* **CONSTITUTION OF THE FANTI CONFEDERATION.**: **ARTICLE XXXIX.**—That three of the ex-officio members of the Executive Council, or two ex-officio and two non-official members, shall form a quorum of said Council and be competent to deliberate on all matters laid before it for consideration by the Secretary or Under-Secretary or any other member thereof.

**No. 1.—Form of oath to be administered to the King President.**

I swear that I will well, truly, and faithfully, serve my country, and in the capacity of King President maintain the Constitution of the Fanti Confederation; and that I will not conceal any apparent danger, damage, or harm which may be likely or possible to arise, without giving, or causing to be given, speedy notice thereof; and that I will truly, faithfully, and disinterestedly endeavour to use calm and peaceable means to quell any and every disturbance that may arise in any part of the Confederation. So help me God.

**No. 2.—Oath of allegiance to the King President.**
* **Innocency of the Fanti Confederation**: Sir,—Not understanding as yet what could be the reasons, or rather objections, to the formation of the Fanti Confederation, and my mind being still denied this knowledge by its opposers, I make no hesitation in imploring your usual kindness for a space in your next number for this my letter, to continue giving you the sentiments which pervaded the meetings we had at Mankessim respecting it, and also the course which they dictated.

II. In my last explanations I remarked what caused my coming out with those explanations—viz., to check, if possible, the misrepresentations the enemies of this Confederation make, and to invite the sympathies of its interested parties. I may as well now give you the reflections of those meetings on the bands of our connexion with the British Government, as there appears to have been no proper regulations formed out with the Fantis, or rather between them and the British Government, that the friends of the Confederation may know how to defend it.

## The Fanti Confederation faced internal and external challenges, including opposition and accusations of fabrication.

The claim that the Fanti Confederation faced internal and external challenges, including opposition and accusations of fabrication, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights external challenges such as the need for recognition by the British government, financial inadequacies, and British efforts to repress intellectuals and divide the chiefs, all contributing to the Confederation's collapse. It also discusses British suppression and military actions against the Asante, indirectly affecting the Fanti Confederation. However, it does not mention accusations of fabrication or provide detailed insights into internal challenges. In contrast, The African Times provides a more comprehensive view, detailing internal challenges like the pressure on King Ackenning of Eckoomee to disown his connection with the Confederation and the need for recognition from Her Majesty's Government to prevent dissension. It also addresses external challenges, including skepticism, the presence of spies, and arbitrary actions by Mr. Salmon, which threatened the Confederation's stability. Importantly, The African Times directly addresses accusations of fabrication, refuting claims that the list of kings and chiefs who subscribed to the Constitution was fabricated and asserting the credibility of those who verified the list. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted internal and external challenges faced by the Fanti Confederation, aligning with the claim.

* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance. It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.
In 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.
Asante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat). He was arrested by ruse in 1896 at the time of the rush for colonial territory and deported.

* **Important Fanti Confederation Papers and Correspondence**: That letter, your Excellency will perceive, is signed by many of the kings who did not sign the Constitution, they not being at Mankessim at the time it was framed and passed, and who, Mr. Salmon says, repudiate any connection with us. We have omitted to state that one of the kings, Ackenning of Eckoomee, when called upon to disown connection with the kings and chiefs at Mankessim, declined to do so, but was subsequently compelled by pressure so to do.

Mr. Usher arrived here on the 3rd or 4th of March last, and again resumed the reins of office, and a few days after his arrival issued the proclamation we laid before your Excellency on the 11th instant. So much for this part of our subject, which has been brought to your notice with the view of showing to your Excellency that the existing state of affairs has not been brought about through disloyalty towards Her Majesty's Government, but that the position has been forced upon us.

We have now to deal with the most important questions, and shall endeavour to discuss them as clearly as possible; and we now lay them before your Excellency for submission to the Home Government, and its approval.

1. In the first place, for the Fanti Confederation to be of real practical use in the amelioration, development, and civilization of the country, it must have the recognition, countenance, support, and hearty co-operation of Her Majesty's Government, and its friendly aid and advice.

We do not for one single moment pretend to be able to carry on a government in the interior without such recognition and assistance; for without that the interests of both might clash, and a collision with the Local Government could not in any way further our object, and could have but one result—the breaking up of the Confederation, and the checking of all further progress towards the material improvement of the country for some years. It is, therefore, imperative that the Confederation should have such recognition and co-operation, and that the Local Government should not, by intrigue or other devices, endeavour to sow dissension amongst the members of the Confederation, and should not countenance, uphold, or protect any king or chief, or other person, who has once joined the Confederation, in any acts or deeds against its laws and customs.

2. That the jurisdiction of the Fanti Confederation shall be recognised and acknowledged to extend and be exercised in and over all tribes, peoples, provinces, or districts choosing to join it; and that its authority and jurisdiction, and that of the Local Government, be clearly and strictly defined in judicial and other matters.

* **The Fanti Confederation, its Constitution, and Acting-Administrator Salmon**: whom we believe destined to achieve great good in Fanti. True Gothic House had the misfortune to be a Government prison, and their appointed attendants were jailors; but they were equal to the occasion, and accepted the magnificent accommodation of Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's drawing-rooms,* with a dignity that will long redound to their honour. We feel that the whole of Fanti, every educated African within its borders, every king and chief, the entire people, owe a debt of gratitude to these worthy representatives. Had they flinched before the brutal bellowings and arbitrary measures of an unworthily held authority; they would have greatly compromised the cause of Fanti advancement? It has been often asserted to us that the Fanti Confederation was but a rope of tow, which would snap in sunder so soon as the hand of protective authority on the Coast should deign to touch it rudely; that its members, and more especially its educated ones, would sell one another, betray one another, abandon one another, under the bribes, threats, or cajolery of administrative power; and that every attempt to form a strong native organisation for interior governmental co-operation with the Coast authority, would be futile. Fact has grandly disproved such assertions. True there have been some, it is said, who deserted and denied their brethren, and some who tempted them to mutual betrayal. But although this, like every other great national cause, has had weak members, and power has here as elsewhere not found it difficult to enlist spies and would-be denouncers, the steady firmness of Davidson, Brew, and Amissah, and the unyielding dignity of the kings at Mankessim, have cast that weakness and that wickedness so deeply into shade, that we do not care to trouble ourselves with any further allusions to it. It is always well that the supposed adherents of a new national organisation should be tried and sifted. It is never to be looked for among human agents that the wheat should be without some admixture of chaff; which is only blown away by the wind of seeming peril; and what has happened was, perhaps, necessary to teach the Confederation caution as to its officers and agents, that it may not be misrepresented, deserted, and injured by unworthy ones. We think it deserves great praise for the constitution it has given to itself, the whole of which we print verbatim in this number of our journal. There is certainly nothing in it to justify Mr. Salmon's wrath; and we cannot but think that if it had been submitted to him at early morning, instead of after his Excellency! (save the mark!) had dined, the reception of its bearers would have been of a different character to that which they experienced; and Gothic House would never have acquired historic fame, as connected with the constitution of the Fanti Confederation. The course pursued by us in vindication of the rights and liberties of the Fanti people, and in behalf of Fanti advancement, so soon as we received intelligence of Mr. Salmon's atrociously arbitrary and ridiculous official misconduct, will be seen in the letters addressed by us to the Right. Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and we shall not attempt to indicate what the result of our efforts will or ought to be. It should appear to his lordship, as it seems in our eyes, that in that consolidating act of the Fanti Confederation, the drawing up of that constitution at Mankessim, there is really the birth of a nation, which requires only judicious, enlightened, and Christian guidance, education, and support (such as Great Britain is well calculated to give) during the earlier period of its life, to make it a great instrument of good in West Africa, we feel sure that he will so represent the matter to the other members of the Government in Council, that there will not be any attempt under an administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head, to strangle or dwarf what ought to be nursed and assisted to expand. The education of the children, male and female, throughout Fanti; the opening and maintenance of roads; the development of the vast agricultural and mineral resources of the countries of the Confederation, are objects which must commend themselves to the heart and mind of every member of an enlightened government; and as they are objects that could not by any possibility be attained and achieved without such national movement and co-operation as may be secured through the instrumentality of the Fanti Confederation, we feel no misgiving as to the course that will be pursued by the Earl of Kimberley, in dealing with matters so interesting, and of so much magnitude and importance.
* **Innocency of the Fanti Confederation**: Sir,—Not understanding as yet what could be the reasons, or rather objections, to the formation of the Fanti Confederation, and my mind being still denied this knowledge by its opposers, I make no hesitation in imploring your usual kindness for a space in your next number for this my letter, to continue giving you the sentiments which pervaded the meetings we had at Mankessim respecting it, and also the course which they dictated.

II. In my last explanations I remarked what caused my coming out with those explanations—viz., to check, if possible, the misrepresentations the enemies of this Confederation make, and to invite the sympathies of its interested parties. I may as well now give you the reflections of those meetings on the bands of our connexion with the British Government, as there appears to have been no proper regulations formed out with the Fantis, or rather between them and the British Government, that the friends of the Confederation may know how to defend it.
* **THE KINGS AND CHIEFS OF THE FANTI CONFEDERATION**: Dear Sir,—The authenticity of the list of kings and chiefs who subscribed the Constitution of the Fanti Confederation at the last gathering at Mankessim having been impugned here, and the statement having been made by unprincipled persons, “that the said list was fabricated” for purposes of my own, I think it right to bring under your notice these assertions of enemies of the Confederation, and to give them unqualified contradiction. Mr. W. E. Davidson, Mr. Amissah, Mr. J. C. Bentell, and a host of other persons of credit (which the impugning enemy is not), were at Mankessim at the time, and have, as you well know, verified my statements.

As my only desire is to prevent injury to the Confederation, I content myself with this denial, in your columns, of there being a single particle of truth in the attacks on the Confederation above referred to.—I am, dear Sir, yours truly,
