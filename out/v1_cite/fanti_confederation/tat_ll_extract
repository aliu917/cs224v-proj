{'document_title': 'Important Fanti Confederation Papers and Correspondence', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'These tribes were opposed to such a transfer, and the Commendahs flew to arms in consequence thereof. The kings and chiefs of Fanti, as soon as they heard of the proposed exchange, convened a meeting at Mankessim, and there entered into a solemn compact to render every assistance to their fellow-countrymen, should the Dutch attempt to coerce them into "accepting the Dutch flag." The Dutch bombarded Commendah, and as these tribes were the natural allies of the Fantis, they were compelled to take the field on their behalf. The Fantis took a large force to the seat of war, and, together with these other tribes, besieged and blockaded Elmina, the head-quarters of the Dutch possessions on the Coast of Guinea. This was in the early part of 1868. At this time Mr. Ussher held the reins of government, and by active measures succeeded in inducing the Fantis to raise the blockade and retire. The kings and chiefs of Fanti, and their allies, proceeded direct to Mankessim, and there laid the foundation of the Fanti Confederation. Whilst they were there assembled Mr. Ussher addressed a letter, of date 18th July, 1868, "to the Presidents and other chiefs of Fanti at Mankessim," in which, after dwelling on various circumstances connected with the Elmina war, he proceeded to state: "Your conduct has been such that I can no longer have any relations with you;" and "as you voluntarily throw off your allegiance, you must not be surprised that I accept your act, and treat you, until you come to your senses, as apart from Great Britain;" further, that "in case of a war with Ashanti, as you will have provoked it, you will bear the brunt thereof without help from Government." Mr. Ussher shortly afterwards leaves for England, and Mr. Simpson becomes the chief of the Executive. Mr. Simpson follows closely in Mr. Ussher\'s footsteps, until he realises the fact that unless the rupture between the Government and the Fantis be healed up the progress of the country would be materially retarded.\n\nWith this in view, he proceeds to meet the kings and chiefs at Mankessim, in 1869, and there recognises the Fanti Confederation, by giving it himself the style and designation of the "Fanti Confederacy;" at the same time recognises and approves of the appointment of its principal officers, and acknowledges its authority over the interior districts of the protectorate. On Mr. Simpson\'s return to Cape Coast he had to seek the interference and mediation of the Confederation, for the purpose of ransoming certain Dutch naval officers and sailors who had been captured by the Commendahs; and the treaty, convention, or whatever one may choose to term it, as regards the ransom so to be paid to the Commendahs, through the Fanti Confederation, was ratified by Mr. R. J. Ghartey, as the representative or President thereof, and by Mr. Simpson, for the British Government, and Governor Nagglas, on behalf of the Netherlands.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-18T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1872#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.744, 'probability_score': 0.1}

It is, therefore, imperative that the Confederation should have such recognition and co-operation, and that the Local Government should not, by intrigue or other devices, endeavour to sow dissension amongst the members of the Confederation, and should not countenance, uphold, or protect any king or chief, or other person, who has once joined the Confederation, in any acts or deeds against its laws and customs.\n\n2.

True Gothic House had the misfortune to be a Government prison, and their appointed attendants were jailors; but they were equal to the occasion, and accepted the magnificent accommodation of Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's drawing-rooms,* with a dignity that will long redound to their honour. We feel that the whole of Fanti, every educated African within its borders, every king and chief, the entire people, owe a debt of gratitude to these worthy representatives. Had they flinched before the brutal bellowings and arbitrary measures of an unworthily held authority; they would have greatly compromised the cause of Fanti advancement? It has been often asserted to us that the Fanti Confederation was but a rope of tow, which would snap in sunder so soon as the hand of protective authority on the Coast should deign to touch it rudely; that its members, and more especially its educated ones, would sell one another, betray one another, abandon one another, under the bribes, threats, or cajolery of administrative power; and that every attempt to form a strong native organisation for interior governmental co-operation with the Coast authority, would be futile. Fact has grandly disproved such assertions. True there have been some, it is said, who deserted and denied their brethren, and some who tempted them to mutual betrayal. But although this, like every other great national cause, has had weak members, and power has here as elsewhere not found it difficult to enlist spies and would-be denouncers, the steady firmness of Davidson, Brew, and Amissah, and the unyielding dignity of the kings at Mankessim, have cast that weakness and that wickedness so deeply into shade, that we do not care to trouble ourselves with any further allusions to it. It is always well that the supposed adherents of a new national organisation should be tried and sifted. It is never to be looked for among human agents that the wheat should be without some admixture of chaff; which is only blown away by the wind of seeming peril; and what has happened was, perhaps, necessary to teach the Confederation caution as to its officers and agents, that it may not be misrepresented, deserted, and injured by unworthy ones. We think it deserves great praise for the constitution it has given to itself, the whole of which we print verbatim in this number of our journal. There is certainly nothing in it to justify Mr. Salmon's wrath; and we cannot but think that if it had been submitted to him at early morning, instead of after his Excellency! (save the mark!) had dined, the reception of its bearers would have been of a different character to that which they experienced; and Gothic House would never have acquired historic fame, as connected with the constitution of the Fanti Confederation.

Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and we shall not attempt to indicate what the result of our efforts will or ought to be. It should appear to his lordship, as it seems in our eyes, that in that consolidating act of the Fanti Confederation, the drawing up of that constitution at Mankessim, there is really the birth of a nation, which requires only judicious, enlightened, and Christian guidance, education, and support (such as Great Britain is well calculated to give) during the earlier period of its life, to make it a great instrument of good in West Africa, we feel sure that he will so represent the matter to the other members of the Government in Council, that there will not be any attempt under an administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head, to strangle or dwarf what ought to be nursed and assisted to expand. The education of the children, male and female, throughout Fanti; the opening and maintenance of roads; the development of the vast agricultural and mineral resources of the countries of the Confederation, are objects which must commend themselves to the heart and mind of every member of an enlightened government; and as they are objects that could not by any possibility be attained and achieved without such national movement and co-operation as may be secured through the instrumentality of the Fanti Confederation, we feel no misgiving as to the course that will be pursued by the Earl of Kimberley, in dealing with matters so interesting, and of so much magnitude and importance.", 'last_edit_date': '1872-01-23T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1872#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.729, 'probability_score': 0.098}
