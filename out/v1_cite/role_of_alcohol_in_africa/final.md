The claim that the introduction and trade of alcohol by European powers had a devastating impact on African societies, contributing to social and cultural disruption, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa highlights the flow of strong alcoholic drinks into Africa, noting that alcohol was produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits, often distributed on a large scale as wages. It points out that a significant portion of government revenue in regions like the Niger Coast Protectorate was derived from the trade of spirits, suggesting a deleterious effect on health and a negative impact on African societies. However, it also presents a nuanced perspective by including Mary Kingsley's view that the trade spirit was pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis, indicating some debate on the extent of the impact. In contrast, The African Times provides a more uniformly negative assessment, with paragraphs highlighting the destructive effects of alcohol on African communities. It describes how traders prioritized profit over the well-being of the people, leading to widespread death and societal decay, and how wages paid in spirits resulted in unproductivity and degradation among the native population. The articles emphasize the enormous scale of the liquor trade and its detrimental impact, likening it to a greater evil than slavery, and discuss efforts to prohibit the liquor trade in certain regions due to the severe social issues it caused. Together, these sources align with the claim by illustrating the profound social and cultural disruptions caused by the European alcohol trade in Africa, while also acknowledging differing opinions on its impact.

The claim that the Royal Niger Company took measures to regulate or restrict the alcohol trade in its territories, reflecting a tension between economic interests and social responsibility, is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa suggests that the authorities were economically reliant on the alcohol trade, as a significant portion of government revenue and customs duties in the Niger Coast Protectorate came from spirits. It also notes the ineffectiveness of the Brussels Act of 1892 in regulating the trade in tropical Africa until the eve of the First World War, indicating a lack of effective regulation during the period in question. This perspective implies a prioritization of economic interests over social responsibility. In contrast, The African Times provides evidence that the Royal Niger Company did take measures to regulate or restrict the alcohol trade. The Company imposed heavy duties on imported spirits, checked smuggling, prohibited the payment of wages in spirits, and banned the importation of spirits in certain regions. Following the Anti-Slavery Conference at Brussels, the Company even prohibited spirituous liquors in a significant portion of its jurisdiction. These actions suggest a tension between economic interests and social responsibility, as the Company sought to balance commerce and political influence with minimizing the negative social impact of alcohol. However, the Company's efforts were complicated by the low duties in neighboring territories, which posed challenges to their regulatory measures. Together, these observations highlight a complex interplay between economic reliance on the alcohol trade and attempts at regulation, reflecting the nuanced tension between economic interests and social responsibility.

The claim that the spread of alcohol in Africa was seen as more damaging than the transatlantic slave trade is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides extensive details on the social, economic, and demographic impacts of the transatlantic slave trade, highlighting severe consequences such as population loss and economic instability, but it does not directly compare these impacts to those of alcohol. It notes the significant role of alcohol in government revenue and its distribution as wages but does not provide a comparative analysis with the slave trade. In contrast, The African Times articles offer a perspective that supports the claim, with paragraph [1] emphasizing the extensive and damaging impact of the liquor trade on African societies. It includes a statement from Joseph Thomson, an African traveler, who asserts that the gin trade is a greater evil than slavery, describing it as a scandal and a shame. Paragraph [2] further supports the notion of long-term social and health issues caused by alcohol, noting that regions with restricted access to alcohol exhibit superior conditions compared to those with prevalent alcohol use. While the articles suggest that alcohol was perceived as a significant social ill, potentially more damaging than the slave trade, they do not provide a comprehensive comparison of the long-term impacts of both issues. Thus, while The African Times aligns with the claim, the General History of Africa does not provide information that directly supports or refutes it, nor does it make a direct comparison between the two issues.

The claim that the introduction of European alcoholic beverages exacerbated existing issues of alcohol abuse in Africa, leading to widespread social and health problems, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa highlights the influx of strong alcoholic drinks into Africa, noting that these spirits were produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits, often distributed as wages. A significant portion of government revenue in the Niger Coast Protectorate came from these spirits, and attempts to regulate the trade, such as the Brussels Act of 1892, were largely unsuccessful until the eve of the First World War. This suggests that European alcoholic beverages contributed to social and health issues, although the text does not explicitly mention pre-existing alcohol abuse in Africa. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize that European spirits like rum and gin exacerbated existing alcohol abuse issues, as various African communities already had intoxicating substances such as palm sap, cashew apple juice, and plantain wine, which were often abused. The introduction of European spirits is described as having "destroyed its millions," indicating a significant negative impact on social and health conditions. However, the articles do not provide specific details on the extent of these problems, leaving room for further historical exploration. Together, these sources suggest that European alcoholic beverages worsened existing alcohol-related issues in Africa, aligning with the claim.

The claim that the British colonial administration imposed higher duties on alcohol in the interest of fair trade, but this did not necessarily curb alcohol consumption, is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the economic motivations behind the alcohol trade in Africa, noting that spirits were distributed on a large scale and often used as wages, with significant government revenue derived from this trade. However, it does not mention the imposition of higher duties on alcohol or any efforts to curb consumption, nor does it address fair trade considerations or the impact of duties on consumption levels. In contrast, The African Times provides direct support for the claim, noting that the British colonial administration imposed higher duties on alcohol compared to other colonial powers in West Africa. It highlights that Great Britain led in the amount of duty levied on alcohol in its West African possessions, with duties on imported spirits being higher than those elsewhere in the region. Despite these higher duties, the articles suggest that alcohol consumption was not necessarily curbed, as evidenced by the increasing supply of rum and gin and the expanding area affected by the spirit trade. Additionally, a comparison between British and French territories indicates that higher duties did not prevent the importation of spirits or drunkenness, aligning with the claim that these duties were argued to be in the interest of fair trade but did not effectively reduce alcohol consumption.

The perception of alcohol consumption in Africa, as discussed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, presents a nuanced view that both supports and contrasts with the claim that it was often negative, influencing colonial policies on alcohol regulation. The General History of Africa highlights the negative impact of alcohol on health and its significant role in government revenue, particularly in the Niger Coast Protectorate, where immense profits from the alcohol trade were noted. This suggests a complex economic motivation behind alcohol distribution. However, it also presents contrasting views, such as those from Mary Kingsley and a committee that found the trade spirit pure and less harmful than cannabis, indicating that not all perceptions were negative. The Brussels Act of 1892 attempted to regulate the trade, but effective control was not achieved until the eve of the First World War, suggesting that colonial policies were influenced by both economic interests and health concerns. Similarly, The African Times presents a mixed perspective. Paragraph [0] portrays a negative perception, mentioning an "intense desire to shake off the drunkenness" linked to European contact and the prohibition of liquor traffic by the Royal Niger Company, supporting the claim. However, paragraph [1] offers a counter-narrative, with a trader refuting the notion of rampant drunkenness in West Africa and suggesting that education might be more effective than prohibitive duties. This challenges the idea that perceptions were uniformly negative and that regulation through prohibition was the only approach. Overall, both sources highlight a complex interplay of negative perceptions, economic interests, and differing opinions, suggesting that the perception of alcohol consumption and its regulation in colonial Africa was more nuanced than the claim implies.

The claim that the introduction of European goods, including alcohol, did not necessarily lead to the civilization or improvement of African societies is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, though with some contrasting perspectives. The General History of Africa highlights several negative impacts of European goods: paragraph [0] discusses the deleterious effects of the alcohol trade on health and its role as a significant source of government revenue, indicating a lack of positive societal contribution. Paragraph [5] notes that colonial rule and its racial policies hindered African participation in education and commerce, while paragraph [6] mentions the use of firearms to control slaves, all suggesting that European influence did not inherently lead to societal advancement. Similarly, The African Times paragraph [0] supports the claim by describing the negative impact of the liquor trade on African societies, particularly on the West Coast, where wages were paid in spirits, leading to widespread drunkenness and reduced labor productivity. However, paragraph [1] from The African Times offers a counter-narrative, suggesting that alcohol consumption on the Gold Coast was not as detrimental as often claimed, with statistics showing relatively uncommon drunkenness and temperate habits among West African natives, comparable to those in the United Kingdom. This implies that the introduction of European goods, including alcohol, did not necessarily have a demoralizing influence. Thus, while the General History of Africa and The African Times paragraph [0] align with the claim, The African Times paragraph [1] presents a different perspective, highlighting the complexity of the issue.
