## The Ashanti Kingdom's control and influence over its vassal states and neighboring tribes were challenged due to its oppressive rule and military demands.

The claim that the Ashanti Kingdom's control and influence over its vassal states and neighboring tribes were challenged due to its oppressive rule and military demands is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the Ashanti's imposition of political domination and military demands on other Akan peoples, leading to frequent clashes and wars with groups such as the Akyem, Akuapem, and Fante. It also discusses the Ashanti's military and political control over non-Akan states like the Dagomba, Mamprusi, and Gonja, emphasizing economic exploitation and the use of these states' manpower in Ashanti wars. The textbook further describes confrontations with the British, which eventually led to the disintegration of the Ashanti empire, and notes the Ashanti's expansion and control over various kingdoms required to pay tribute, indicating oppressive rule. Additionally, the Asante's attempts to enforce claims over territories like Elmina, Assin, Denkyira, and Akyem led to conflicts with the British. Similarly, The African Times provides details that support the claim, describing how states such as Adansi, Becqua, and Juabin sought to secede from Ashanti's rule due to oppression and the desire for independence, being held together more by fear of punishment than by loyalty. It also details the refusal of the Quocofocoos and the people of Konton-Assie to submit to the Ashanti King, Koffee Carry Carry, due to his oppressive actions, including the killing of chiefs and conscription for war, leading to a loss of support and allegiance. Both sources collectively illustrate the challenges to Ashanti's control stemming from its oppressive rule and military demands, aligning with the claim.

* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: However, with the Akan states the problem was essentially one of sovereignty. There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.
As proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: The third category of states included geographically and culturally distant peoples such as the Dagomba, the Mamprusi and the Gonja. They were viewed by the Asante authorities primarily as having to contribute to the economic development of the metropolis. These non-Akan states to the north were subjected to military and political control because of their economic resources. They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army. An old Asante source declared on this subject: Na yene wonom nko nhyiamu ('We did not hold council with them').
* **Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)**: Nowhere in West Africa had there been a longer tradition of confrontation between Africans and Europeans than in the Gold Coast between the Asante and the British. This started in the 1760s and culminated in a military engagement in 1824 in which the Asante defeated the British forces and their allies and killed their commander, Sir Charles MacCarthy, the then Governor of the Gold Coast.$^{39}$ Two years later, the British avenged this defeat at the battle of Dodowa. In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast. Above all, the Asantehene was deposed partly as a result of the outcome of the 1874
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: In the eighteenth century the Asante dynasties carved a vast empire for themselves in the heart of the forest and south of the Black Volta river bend.$^{1}$ Thanks to Osei Tutu, the founder, Opoku Ware and Osei Kodjo, this kingdom was highly integrated, with its nucleus around Kumasi and the Golden Stool (sikadwa). It wielded undisputed economic and political power over the coast and over the dependent kingdoms to the north. Towards the centre, kingdoms associated with the Oyoko clan from Kumasi gradually became subjugated and tributary on account of structural reforms carried out by Osei Kodjo, first, in the kingdom of Kumasi, and then at the expense of the neighbouring Akan kingdoms: Mampong, Nsuta, Dwaben, Bekwai, Kokofu, Bono, as also Denkyira, Ahafo, Sefwi, Adansi, etc. In this region, the Kumasihene (king of Kumasi) became the Asantehene. From this base, the Asante dynasty held political and economic sway over the coastal kingdoms (Wassa, Nzima, Twifu, Akwamu, Akyem, Akuapem, Ga and Adangbe), and more especially the coastal strip of the Fante chief› taincies. Similarly, to the north, the kingdoms of Gyaman, Gonja, Dagomba and Mamprusi came under the sway of Asante, sanctioned by a yearly tribute (ayibuade) of two thousand slaves, especially after the 1794 treaty.
The nineteenth century was to start with the reign of one of the greatest of the Asantehenes, Osei Bonsu (1801-24), whose victorious armies pushed through to the coast in a series of campaigns (1807, 1811 and 1814). The British, who at the time were caught up in the Napoleonic Wars and had no clear policy for their Gold Coast settlements, could not but recognize, through the President of the Council of Merchants, Colonel Torrane, and his successors, the reality of the suzerainty, or even sovereignty, of Asante over all the coastal peoples.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance. It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.
In 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.
Asante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat). He was arrested by ruse in 1896 at the time of the rush for colonial territory and deported.

* **THE MISSION TO KUMASI.**: In order to understand the revolution which is now occurring in Ashanti and the purpose of Captain Lee's mission to Kumasi, it will be necessary to consider for a moment the real nature of the kingdom which is or was governed by Calcalli, and if we trace it to its origin we find that about 200 years ago the Ashantees were a small tribe, vassals of Denkyera, then a powerful state, now part of our Protectorate. The Ashantees being ill-treated, rebelled, gained their independence, and founded Kumasi. They were surrounded by small kingdoms—Becqua, Kokofo, Mampom, Adansi, and Juabin—all of which they conquered; but these states still remained under their own kings, who paid tribute to the King of Ashanti, contributed soldiers when he went to war, attended the capital at certain festivals, and were summoned, as occasion arose, to councils, at which each chief or king spoke in turn, according to his rank. Thus it will be seen that the Ashanti nation was not homogeneous, but composed of various kingdoms which cherished the tradition of their independent sovereignty, which were held together more by the fear of punishment, and which were prepared at any time to secede from tyranny and taxation should any misfortune befall the imperial tribe. This seceding or separating process had already commenced before our troops were out of Ashanti. The Chief of Adansi and his people had been much oppressed by Ashanti. He resisted the white men, but as soon as Kumasi had been taken and the struggle decided he determined to throw off his ancient yoke and place himself in the hands of the stronger and also more merciful Power. He met Sir G. Wolseley in the ruins of Fomano, his own capital, and there made arrangements for migrating into the Protectorate. At the same time a rumour reached the General that the Chief or King of Becqua desired to follow the example of Adansi. Becqua is a powerful state, and its capital which our troops destroyed was not much smaller than Kumasi. Finally, the King of Juabin sent in his submission to Glorer, and afterwards began negotiations with the King of Eastern Akim, with a view to migration to that country. It seems that Becqua and Juabin have now determined to hold their own territory, to cast off their allegiance, and to resist any attempt that Calcalli may make to subdue them. Becqua is supported by Denkyera, and Juabin by Akim. Kumasi and its territory lie just between the rebellious states, and it is, to say the least, doubtful whether Kokofo and Mampom will assist the Ashantees, whose kingdom seems now reduced to its first elements—viz., a small tribe, a city which we may assume is not yet perfectly rebuilt, and a few plantation villages. It is, therefore, not surprising that the King should have sent to the white men for help. He says that he wants peace, and that war will be bad for trade; but as his messengers have passed without being molested through the Becqua territory, it is quite evident that these Becquas do not intend to be the aggressors. They were once free, they became slaves, and now they wish to be free again. Half a century ago, when Bowdich visited Kumasi, Juabin was an independent Power allied with Ashanti; and the early treaties with the English are in the joint names of Ashanti and Juabin. What more natural and laudable than that its chief should desire to regain the power which Ashantea craft and crime had taken from his ancestors? It is to be hoped that Calcalli will be made to understand that we do not deplore the misfortunes which his arrogance and exactions have brought upon himself, and that an attempt to subdue his rebellious vassals will meet with no sympathy from the British Government. A civil war in Ashanti would be injurious to trade, but it is not probable that the Ashantees will make war upon their neighbours. In the long run trade will certainly profit by the dissolution of the kingdom. If Ashanti had retained its ancient imperial power, war would have been the one occupation of that people, as it has been for the last 200 years. They might not have dared to invade the Protectorate, but they had plenty of other hunting grounds. Nor is it probable that the King would have ever made Ashanti a thoroughfare. Behind that country, to the north, are tribes rich in gold and cotton, who desire to reach the sea and trade with Europeans. It has always been the policy of Ashanti to check this enterprising spirit, and so to monopolize the trade. Kumasi was the *ne plus ultra* both for those who came from the north and those who came from the south; and so great was the dread of Ashanti among the neighbouring tribes, that I found in 1868, when I contemplated exploration from the Gold Coast and inspected the ground, it would be impossible to pass into the interior by any route between the Asini and the Volta without being arrested and sent to Kumasi. This cordon is now broken up, and it is probable that before very long the Germans and other tribes at the back of Ashanti will find their way down to the Coast. It has been frequently affirmed that...
* **CAPTAIN LEES' MISSION TO ASHANTI.**: On Captain Lees' return to Kumasi, the King complained of the Quocofocoos, and wanted Captain Lees to endeavour to bring them under his sway again. He went to the district, but in the meantime informed the King that, should the people refuse to come back to him, he could not force them, but only advise them to live in peace. On his arrival they vehemently refused to go under Koffee Carry Carry again; they said that they were ready to serve the golden stool of Ashanti, but that they object in toto to serve Carry Carry; that he had killed all the principal chiefs in the place, and consequently they would have nothing more to do with him. Captain Lees told them that he could not force them to serve the King, but he made them take the oath that they would keep the peace, open roads, and leave off kidnapping. The King was very much disappointed on Captain Lees' return, but could not help himself. He then made a complaint against the people of Konton-Assie. It appears that whilst in the zenith of his power, and from what is called time immemorial, these people have sent to the King of Ashanti every morning, with the exception of two days in the week, fresh river fish; now they refuse to make the usual supply and to serve him. This pains Carry Carry very much; and without them he cannot get such a good supply of fish as heretofore. Captain Lees undertook the journey to this place, and saw the Chief. The road was one of the worst that it is possible to imagine. The Chief refused to have anything to do with the King of Ashanti. He told Captain Lees to look at his village, how it was overgrown with weed; that since Carry Carry came to the throne he has taken all his people to go to war, and a great many have, in consequence, died; and he was not going to submit himself to such treatment again. He took fetish to keep the peace, open roads, and not molest the people of the King. The King was not very much pleased with this decision; but he has no power whatever to force his own decrees, and therefore must abide by it.

There seems to be some idea that, as the seat of Government, Captain Strahan prefers Cape Coast to Elmina and (there being no earthquakes here) to Accra. It is said that he thinks he can make it more healthy by sanitary measures than Elmina, with its neighbouring mangrove swamps, would be. This would not prevent everything possible being done to make Elmina a good landing and shipping port. Some decision will, no doubt, soon be come to; and whenever it may be known you shall, of course, hear of it without delay.—Yours truly,

## The British military intervention and campaigns against the Ashanti Kingdom, including the capture and destruction of Kumasi, were part of a broader strategy to consolidate control over the Gold Coast region.

The claim that the British military intervention and campaigns against the Ashanti Kingdom, including the capture and destruction of Kumasi, were part of a broader strategy to consolidate control over the Gold Coast region is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa outlines a series of British actions aimed at weakening Ashanti influence and consolidating control, such as the capture and burning of Kumasi in 1874, the Treaty of Fomena which forced the Ashanti to renounce their rights on the Gold Coast, and the annexation of Ashanti in 1901. These actions, including the deposition of anti-British chiefs and imposition of taxes, illustrate a pattern of strategic maneuvers to consolidate British rule. The African Times adds context by highlighting the political fragmentation within the Ashanti Kingdom, suggesting that British intervention might have been seen as an opportunity to support the secession of smaller states, aligning with the strategic consolidation claim. It also reflects on the historical tensions between the Ashanti and the British, framing the 1874 actions as part of a continuum of engagements to subdue Ashanti power. However, it contrasts this view by describing the destruction of Kumasi as a moral retribution against Ashanti practices, suggesting a moral justification for British actions. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that incorporates both strategic and moral dimensions of the British campaigns against the Ashanti Kingdom.

* **Military conquest, 1885-1902**: Britain's military imperialism was equally spectacular and bloody; the African response, as will be seen in the following chapters, was also resolute and often prolonged. Operating from its coastal possessions on the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and in Nigeria, Britain halted effectively French expansion towards the lower Niger and into the Asante hinterland. The last Kumasi expedition (1900) was followed up in 1901 by the annexation of Asante, and Nana Prempeh was exiled to the Seychelles. The Northern Territories to the north of Asante were also formally annexed in 1901, having been occupied between 1896 and 1898. From the Lagos colony, Britain launched its conquest of Nigeria. By 1893 most of Yorubaland had been proclaimed a protectorate; the conquest of Itsekiriland was accomplished in 1894, and Nana Olomu, its resourceful 'merchant prince', was exiled to Accra; and while apparently unable to challenge King Jaja of Opobo in open battle, Harry Johnston, the British Consul, tricked him into attend› ing a meeting aboard a British warship, where he was made prisoner and shipped to the West Indies in 1887. Both Brass and Bini were duly con› quered by the end of the century. By 1900, British supremacy in southern Nigeria was more or less assured. The effective occupation of Igboland and some other areas of the eastern hinterland, however, were not accom› plished until the first two decades of this century. To the north, British conquest was accomplished from Nupe, where - by 1895 - George Goldie's Royal Niger Company exercised influence from Lokoja to the sea. Ilorin was occupied in 1897; and after the establishment of the West African Frontier Force in 1898 the Sokoto sultanate was conquered by Lugard in 1902.
In North Africa, Britain, already in a commanding position in Egypt, waited until 1896 when the reconquest of the Sudan was authorized. This was achieved in 1898 with savage and unnecessary bloodshed. Over 20000 Sudanese, including their leader, Khalifa 'Abdallah, died in battle. France's occupation of Fashoda in the south of the Sudan (1898) was understandably not countenanced by Lord Salisbury, and the French were forced to withdraw.
* **African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > The Yaa Asantewaa War**: Like the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898, the Asante uprising of 1900 was precipitated by the attempts of the British to consolidate their rule by the deposition of some of the anti-British chiefs and the appointment to replace them of people who were not traditionally qualified, and by the imposition of a tax, in this case 4s per head, as a war indemnity in 1897. But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.
Similar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony. This resistance by the Baule which broke out in 1908 continued until 1910 when, using the notorious search and destroy tactics, the French suppressed all remain› ing opposition with a brutality and wickedness unparalleled in the annals of African resistance (see Plate 6.5a). At the end of this, the population of the Baule had dropped from about 1.5 million in 1900 to about 260000 by .191 i.$^{6S}$ The neighbours of the Baule, the Guro, the Dan and the Bete held out till 1919.

He says that he wants peace, and that war will be bad for trade; but as his messengers have passed without being molested through the Becqua territory, it is quite evident that these Becquas do not intend to be the aggressors. They were once free, they became slaves, and now they wish to be free again. Half a century ago, when Bowdich visited Kumasi, Juabin was an independent Power allied with Ashanti; and the early treaties with the English are in the joint names of Ashanti and Juabin. What more natural and laudable than that its chief should desire to regain the power which Ashantea craft and crime had taken from his ancestors? It is to be hoped that Calcalli will be made to understand that we do not deplore the misfortunes which his arrogance and exactions have brought upon himself, and that an attempt to subdue his rebellious vassals will meet with no sympathy from the British Government. A civil war in Ashanti would be injurious to trade, but it is not probable that the Ashantees will make war upon their neighbours. In the long run trade will certainly profit by the dissolution of the kingdom. If Ashanti had retained its ancient imperial power, war would have been the one occupation of that people, as it has been for the last 200 years. They might not have dared to invade the Protectorate, but they had plenty of other hunting grounds. Nor is it probable that the King would have ever made Ashanti a thoroughfare. Behind that country, to the north, are tribes rich in gold and cotton, who desire to reach the sea and trade with Europeans. It has always been the policy of Ashanti to check this enterprising spirit, and so to monopolize the trade. Kumasi was the *ne plus ultra* both for those who came from the north and those who came from the south; and so great was the dread of Ashanti among the neighbouring tribes, that I found in 1868, when I contemplated exploration from the Gold Coast and inspected the ground, it would be impossible to pass into the interior by any route between the Asini and the Volta without being arrested and sent to Kumasi. This cordon is now broken up, and it is probable that before very long the Germans and other tribes at the back of Ashanti will find their way down to the Coast. It has been frequently affirmed that...
* **The Past, Present, and Future**: Sir,—As time goes by and brings its revenges, we do not mock at the present destruction of Kumasi by the British Government (although as individuals we have reason enough to do so), but we think the matter worthy of notice. June 15, 1807, was a sad time for the Fantees, especially of this town, with its near and remote neighbourhoods. Then, again, Sir Charles McCarthy arrived at the Coast some time in March, 1822, and on January 21, 1824, was fought the fatal battle, Essamacow. On May 21 of the same year, another battle was fought at Effootoo, and on the 11th and 13th of July, within sight of Cape Coast, another battle also was fought, with some loss to the Ashantees, by Colonel Sutherland. On the 26th of August, 1826, at Accra, in the plain of Doodowah, another battle was fought by Major Purdon, with a crushing loss to the Ashantees. After three or four years, negotiations took place between the Ashantees and the Protectorate (in 1830), under Governor Maclean. In 1853 the Ashantee force came, but returned, without making any attack. During this time, the Honourable Geo. Blankson was sent to Kumasi by the authorities at Cape Coast to open the roads for trade. He succeeded in this. In the year 1863 the Ashantee force came again, and battles took place at Essicoomah, and then at Bobicoomah. Since then, palaver goes, palaver comes, palaver goes, palaver comes, all the time, with some handsome presents sent up to Kumasi now and then to his Majesty the King by the merchants, with a view to cool his heart to open the path for business; but all to no purpose, and it ends with the war of 1873 and the present year, 1874.

Had the monarch any idea that the time was so changed and unlike that the year 1874 would bring him and his kingdom a grievous, sufficient, and equal reply to the disaster of Essamacow in 1824, he would not have sent down his people into this Protectorate in such a manner. Had he known that after fifty years from Sir Charles' time, Kumasi also would be conquered and taken by the British Government, he would have learned wisdom and avoided the trouble which has now come upon him.

Our reflection on these things, dear Mr. Editor, are, that Providence will yet make the whole Gold Coast, with Ashantees, &c., one country under the British Government; one flag, all brothers—only the wild King to be locked up, and let the people rest.—I am, Sir, your most obedient and humble servant,
* **KUMASI BURNT AND DESTROYED**: Retribution has fallen on the capital of Ashanti. Kumasi is no more! The Avenger of Blood has been there! Purifying flame has passed over the gore-drenched soil. The palace—from which not only was the fiat of death diurnally issuing, but which was itself the head-quarters of human sacrifice, offered to gratify the natural ferocity or superstitious dread of its chief occupant, mined, blown up, and finally burned, is now, like the town, a heap of ruins. When Captain Sartorius, sent by Captain Glover to greet Sir Garnet Wolseley, passed through Kumasi, some days after the act of purification had begun, these ruins were still smoking, and not one living being was to be found there. The desolation was for the time complete. May it ever be so; for if the dying agonies of myriads of torturingly murdered human beings had a voice that reached to heaven, it was a spot to be for ever accursed, and against which vengeance could only have slumbered. We do not write against Ashanti as a conquering State—against its kings and chiefs as always thirsting for increased dominion and power. For characteristics such as these, we might equally denounce some civilized nations. We have denounced and do write against Ashanti, as a wanton shedder of human blood, for which it was ever athirst, which was its daily and hourly stimulant, and of which it would have drained the last drop from the Fanti countries, as it has done from many other interior ones, had not the protecting flag of Great Britain floated over the Castle at Cape Coast. That such a kingdom should be divested of the power it has hitherto possessed for gratifying such demon-like propensities, is surely a result that may well be regarded with satisfaction and rejoicing even by those whose principles are the most opposed to war. Kumasi has fallen! And here it is natural that we should draw attention to the ridiculous magnitude and importance which fear—fear of prisoners and visitors—had given to this blood-deluged town. Its population, though variously estimated, was by every one placed at a high figure; and yet all who have taken part in Sir Garnet Wolseley's expedition seem to agree that it could not have ever contained more than ten thousand inhabitants. We are not surprised at this. Kumasi could scarcely have been an attractive place of residence even for Ashantees. It was wanting in one very material point, and that is the element of security. The sacrifice of others, their torture, the perpetual smell of human blood and putrifying human flesh, may have been delicious; but the great human tiger was too near, and every man's life too much at his mercy, to allow of the enjoyment being satisfactory. We have, however, alluded to this scant population of a place reported to be very populous, principally to show how grossly exaggerated are the estimates of Africans, and even those of Europeans, when the objects are seen through the mists of native African fear and admiration. In conclusion, we must express the belief that there will be a new Kumasi, either on the old or on some new site, the latter being the most probable; and the hope that it may attain to and deserve a reputation diametrically opposed to that of the vile slaughter-house which has been so righteously destroyed.

## The Ashanti Kingdom's focus on warfare and territorial expansion hindered the development of trade routes and economic growth, creating a monopoly that stifled the economic potential of neighboring tribes.

The claim that the Ashanti Kingdom's focus on warfare and territorial expansion hindered the development of trade routes and economic growth, creating a monopoly that stifled the economic potential of neighboring tribes, is addressed with nuanced perspectives from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the Ashanti's interest in political domination and sovereignty over other Akan peoples, leading to frequent clashes and wars, such as those with the Akyem and Akuapem over trade routes. This suggests a link between the Ashanti's military pursuits and control over trade routes, but it does not explicitly state that this hindered economic growth or created a monopoly that stifled neighboring tribes' economic potential. Instead, it emphasizes the Ashanti's imposition of political structures and tribute systems, indicating a focus on economic development through tribute and integration of Asante institutions. This suggests that while the Ashanti were involved in warfare and territorial expansion, they also sought economic benefits, complicating the claim that their focus solely hindered economic growth. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by describing how the Ashanti Kingdom maintained control over its vassal states through fear and punishment, monopolizing trade and preventing tribes rich in gold and cotton from reaching the sea to trade with Europeans. The articles note that Kumasi, the Ashanti capital, served as a barrier (*ne plus ultra*) for trade routes, effectively stifling the economic potential of neighboring tribes. However, they do not explicitly state that warfare was the sole reason for the lack of economic development, leaving room for other contributing factors. Together, these sources provide a complex view of the Ashanti Kingdom's impact on regional trade and economic growth, highlighting both political and economic motivations behind their actions.

* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: However, with the Akan states the problem was essentially one of sovereignty. There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.
As proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: The third category of states included geographically and culturally distant peoples such as the Dagomba, the Mamprusi and the Gonja. They were viewed by the Asante authorities primarily as having to contribute to the economic development of the metropolis. These non-Akan states to the north were subjected to military and political control because of their economic resources. They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army. An old Asante source declared on this subject: Na yene wonom nko nhyiamu ('We did not hold council with them').

* **THE MISSION TO KUMASI.**: In order to understand the revolution which is now occurring in Ashanti and the purpose of Captain Lee's mission to Kumasi, it will be necessary to consider for a moment the real nature of the kingdom which is or was governed by Calcalli, and if we trace it to its origin we find that about 200 years ago the Ashantees were a small tribe, vassals of Denkyera, then a powerful state, now part of our Protectorate. The Ashantees being ill-treated, rebelled, gained their independence, and founded Kumasi. They were surrounded by small kingdoms—Becqua, Kokofo, Mampom, Adansi, and Juabin—all of which they conquered; but these states still remained under their own kings, who paid tribute to the King of Ashanti, contributed soldiers when he went to war, attended the capital at certain festivals, and were summoned, as occasion arose, to councils, at which each chief or king spoke in turn, according to his rank. Thus it will be seen that the Ashanti nation was not homogeneous, but composed of various kingdoms which cherished the tradition of their independent sovereignty, which were held together more by the fear of punishment, and which were prepared at any time to secede from tyranny and taxation should any misfortune befall the imperial tribe. This seceding or separating process had already commenced before our troops were out of Ashanti. The Chief of Adansi and his people had been much oppressed by Ashanti. He resisted the white men, but as soon as Kumasi had been taken and the struggle decided he determined to throw off his ancient yoke and place himself in the hands of the stronger and also more merciful Power. He met Sir G. Wolseley in the ruins of Fomano, his own capital, and there made arrangements for migrating into the Protectorate. At the same time a rumour reached the General that the Chief or King of Becqua desired to follow the example of Adansi. Becqua is a powerful state, and its capital which our troops destroyed was not much smaller than Kumasi. Finally, the King of Juabin sent in his submission to Glorer, and afterwards began negotiations with the King of Eastern Akim, with a view to migration to that country. It seems that Becqua and Juabin have now determined to hold their own territory, to cast off their allegiance, and to resist any attempt that Calcalli may make to subdue them. Becqua is supported by Denkyera, and Juabin by Akim. Kumasi and its territory lie just between the rebellious states, and it is, to say the least, doubtful whether Kokofo and Mampom will assist the Ashantees, whose kingdom seems now reduced to its first elements—viz., a small tribe, a city which we may assume is not yet perfectly rebuilt, and a few plantation villages.

## The decline of Kumasi and the Ashanti Kingdom was influenced by the lack of strong leadership, leading to the neglect and decay of infrastructure and the inability to capitalize on its strategic location for trade.

The decline of Kumasi and the Ashanti Kingdom is a multifaceted issue, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook attributes the decline primarily to military defeats, internal conflicts, and external pressures, such as the British military campaign that captured and burnt Kumasi in 1874, leading to the Treaty of Fomena and the subsequent weakening of the Ashanti Kingdom. It highlights the disintegration of the Ashanti Empire and the independence of its vassal states, as well as internal conflicts like the civil war between Kumasi and Dwaben. These factors emphasize military and political instability rather than issues of leadership or infrastructure. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the neglect and decay of infrastructure in Kumasi, noting the deterioration of roads, the fall of houses, and the desolate appearance of the town, which aligns with the claim of neglect. They also mention the absence of a king and the poor condition of the palace, suggesting a lack of strong leadership. However, the articles do not address the strategic location for trade or the inability to capitalize on it, nor do they explicitly connect these issues to the broader decline. Thus, while the articles support the claim regarding neglect and leadership, the textbook emphasizes military and political factors, providing a more comprehensive view of the decline.

* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance. It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.
In 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.
Asante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat). He was arrested by ruse in 1896 at the time of the rush for colonial territory and deported.
* **Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)**: Nowhere in West Africa had there been a longer tradition of confrontation between Africans and Europeans than in the Gold Coast between the Asante and the British. This started in the 1760s and culminated in a military engagement in 1824 in which the Asante defeated the British forces and their allies and killed their commander, Sir Charles MacCarthy, the then Governor of the Gold Coast.$^{39}$ Two years later, the British avenged this defeat at the battle of Dodowa. In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast. Above all, the Asantehene was deposed partly as a result of the outcome of the 1874

* **KUMASI**: Kumasi (Coomassie), when compared with the towns in the Yoruba country and the immense cities of the Mohammedan kingdom which range from Senegambia on the west to Bornu far east of the Niger, is a small town. The exigencies of war have from time to time affected its population; but putting together what Bowdich, Dupuis, Freeman, and others have to say on this point, we should question if the actual average resident population of the Ashanti capital ever exceeded 15,000. The slaves of the chiefs for the most part live in the plantations, and when called in by their masters doubtless increased this number to the 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 which travellers often thought they saw. On the grandest occasions, when the tributary kings or high chiefs of Kukofu, Bekwai, Dwabin, Mampon, &c., were ordered to Kumasi, which occurred at least once a year, 80,000 is easily conceivable. Since the 1874 expedition, its numbers have been diminishing, and it is open to question whether there is now even 5,000, and adding to this its village populations 10,000, who properly belong to Kumasi. It has no wall and trench around it, like many of the cities above referred to. Nor does it require them. The Subin swamp and surrounding forest are an excellent protection, and with engineering skill, could make the place a very formidable stronghold. It is not until the stranger is within the town itself that he becomes really conscious of the fact that he is in Kumasi. It is not a city set upon a hill or placed upon a plain that is visible afar off. A few minutes after you emerge from the shades of the silent swamp, you find yourself surrounded by clusters of thatch-roofed houses and among a considerable population moving to and fro along well-beaten paths. The suddenness with which the traveller debouches upon the town is almost as abrupt as an unexpected change of scenes and actors upon a stage. Formerly these tracks leading straight into the main streets were good-sized, kept-clean roads. Now, the giant grasses and encroaching bush have narrowed many of them to mere sheep-walks. Once, lines of houses ranged along them; now those lines are broken into hundreds of places; and only here and there a roof rears its head among the tall stalks and marks their former site. In its glory, a bird's-eye view of the town would have described it as a vast collection of thatch-roofed compounds taking more of an oblong figure than any other. Its appearance now is that of a town, consisting of separate clusters of habitations, the densest being in the palace quarter. With the fall of scores of chiefs, whose households chiefly peopled Kumasi, there has been the fall of their houses. Whether they had successors or not, their spacious compounds have not been rebuilt. Wild convolvuli and all sorts of creepers vie with one another as if in haste to cover up the ruins. Hence the desolate, neglected, woe-begone appearance the place now wears. The stranger has no need to be told that at present it has no king, and that the last was too poor and disheartened to restore even a little of its faded glory. Those streets, once so many, so spacious, so clean, so much more noble-looking than other African streets, by reason of those most unique and handsomely decorated Dampans which adorned them, are now in many places filthy and despicable beyond description. Where the pigs do not snout it, nor the gold-seekers disturb it, or the friction of naked feet keep it bare, each street is left to look after itself. The Dampans are ornate house-frontages, verandah-like in that they are covered and open to the street; but are raised in dais form about three feet above the street, in order that the Ashanti magnate may observe and be observed of every one as he takes his haughty ease upon his throne. Of about 150 of these pretty buildings, about a score is left; but not one, we believe, is in perfect condition. Most of its fifty streets, with their curious nomenclature (Cook's, Horn-blower's, Executioner's, Drum's street, &c.), are doubtless still traceable even where the bush flourishes instead of wealthy chiefs' households. That famous market-place, that noble road that led from it to Bantama, along which, prophets say, no more triumphal armies will ever march with their ghastly spoils of victory—their pitiable state excites a sigh of sorrow, and half a prayer that even now Kumasi would see its folly, alter its policy, and make itself a prosperous mart for the extensive commerce of the vast regions beyond it. A grim idea possesses one as he sees that horrid appestiam, the charnel-house of beheaded thousands, rapidly encroaching upon the market-place—it that the innocent dead that lie there, heaps upon heaps, have vowed that that blood-shedding market-place shall be obliterated for ever. The palace, like everything else, is in several places tumbling down, and unless an energetic king is soon enthroned and sets upon repairing it, Kumasi's next monarch must build himself a new residence. It is not believed now that much innocent blood is spilled in the capital. Offenders are undoubtedly as summarily disposed of as ever, and, unquestionable authority says, in a public manner. Their slaves are so few in comparison with former days, their prospect for increasing them so hopeless, that they have to be very economical at the burial customs of even the great men, but a few of whom are left to bewail the fate of the nation. The immense number of hawks, crows, and vultures which still sweep round the town in ceaseless gyrations tempt one to be suspicious; but a moment's thought, that if they go elsewhere they fare much worse, explains why they still cling to the scenes of their former horrid feasts.
* **KUMASI**: Kumasi (Coomassie), when compared with the towns in the Yoruba country and the immense cities of the Mohammedan kingdom which range from Senegambia on the west to Bornu far east of the Niger, is a small town. The exigencies of war have from time to time affected its population; but putting together what Bowdich, Dupuis, Freeman, and others have to say on this point, we should question if the actual average resident population of the Ashanti capital ever exceeded 15,000. The slaves of the chiefs for the most part live in the plantations, and when called in by their masters doubtless increased this number to the 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 which travellers often thought they saw. On the grandest occasions, when the tributary kings or high chiefs of Kukofu, Bekwai, Dwabin, Mampon, &c., were ordered to Kumasi, which occurred at least once a year, 80,000 is easily conceivable. Since the 1874 expedition, its numbers have been diminishing, and it is open to question whether there is now even 5,000, and adding to this its village populations 10,000, who properly belong to Kumasi. It has no wall and trench around it, like many of the cities above referred to. Nor does it require them. The Subin swamp and surrounding forest are an excellent protection, and with engineering skill, could make the place a very formidable stronghold. It is not until the stranger is within the town itself that he becomes really conscious of the fact that he is in Kumasi. It is not a city set upon a hill or placed upon a plain that is visible afar off. A few minutes after you emerge from the shades of the silent swamp, you find yourself surrounded by clusters of thatch-roofed houses and among a considerable population moving to and fro along well-beaten paths. The suddenness with which the traveller debouches upon the town is almost as abrupt as an unexpected change of scenes and actors upon a stage. Formerly these tracks leading straight into the main streets were good-sized, kept-clean roads. Now, the giant grasses and encroaching bush have narrowed many of them to mere sheep-walks. Once, lines of houses ranged along them; now those lines are broken into hundreds of places; and only here and there a roof rears its head among the tall stalks and marks their former site. In its glory, a bird's-eye view of the town would have described it as a vast collection of thatch-roofed compounds taking more of an oblong figure than any other. Its appearance now is that of a town, consisting of separate clusters of habitations, the densest being in the palace quarter. With the fall of scores of chiefs, whose households chiefly peopled Kumasi, there has been the fall of their houses. Whether they had successors or not, their spacious compounds have not been rebuilt. Wild convolvuli and all sorts of creepers vie with one another as if in haste to cover up the ruins. Hence the desolate, neglected, woe-begone appearance the place now wears. The stranger has no need to be told that at present it has no king, and that the last was too poor and disheartened to restore even a little of its faded glory. Those streets, once so many, so spacious, so clean, so much more noble-looking than other African streets, by reason of those most unique and handsomely decorated Dampans which adorned them, are now in many places filthy and despicable beyond description. Where the pigs do not snout it, nor the gold-seekers disturb it, or the friction of naked feet keep it bare, each street is left to look after itself. The Dampans are ornate house-frontages, verandah-like in that they are covered and open to the street; but are raised in dais form about three feet above the street, in order that the Ashanti magnate may observe and be observed of every one as he takes his haughty ease upon his throne. Of about 150 of these pretty buildings, about a score is left; but not one, we believe, is in perfect condition. Most of its fifty streets, with their curious nomenclature (Cook's, Horn-blower's, Executioner's, Drum's street, &c.), are doubtless still traceable even where the bush flourishes instead of wealthy chiefs' households. That famous market-place, that noble road that led from it to Bantama, along which, prophets say, no more triumphal armies will ever march with their ghastly spoils of victory—their pitiable state excites a sigh of sorrow, and half a prayer that even now Kumasi would see its folly, alter its policy, and make itself a prosperous mart for the extensive commerce of the vast regions beyond it. A grim idea possesses one as he sees that horrid appestiam, the charnel-house of beheaded thousands, rapidly encroaching upon the market-place—it that the innocent dead that lie there, heaps upon heaps, have vowed that that blood-shedding market-place shall be obliterated for ever. The palace, like everything else, is in several places tumbling down, and unless an energetic king is soon enthroned and sets upon repairing it, Kumasi's next monarch must build himself a new residence. It is not believed now that much innocent blood is spilled in the capital. Offenders are undoubtedly as summarily disposed of as ever, and, unquestionable authority says, in a public manner. Their slaves are so few in comparison with former days, their prospect for increasing them so hopeless, that they have to be very economical at the burial customs of even the great men, but a few of whom are left to bewail the fate of the nation.

## The British viewed the integration of the Gold Coast, including the Ashanti, under their governance as a means to bring stability and economic development to the region.

The claim that the British viewed the integration of the Gold Coast, including the Ashanti, under their governance as a means to bring stability and economic development to the region is partially supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa suggests that the British were primarily motivated by their own economic interests, focusing on exploiting the colonies for raw materials with little reciprocity, as highlighted in paragraphs [0] and [1]. While paragraph [4] describes British military efforts to weaken the Asante empire, which could be interpreted as attempts to bring stability, the emphasis appears to be more on diminishing Asante power rather than fostering economic development. Paragraph [9] further underscores the British focus on self-enrichment, with any colonial development being incidental. In contrast, The African Times articles, particularly paragraphs [0] and [1], emphasize the British aim of achieving stability through integration, as reflected in the notion of uniting the region under British rule with "one flag, all brothers." However, these articles do not explicitly mention economic development as a British motive, focusing instead on political and military control. The mention of trade roads opened by Geo. Blankson hints at economic considerations but is not directly linked to British intentions. Overall, while both sources acknowledge British efforts towards regional stability, the primary motivation appears to be economic exploitation rather than genuine development, with The African Times providing less emphasis on economic objectives.

* ****: Right from the early days of British effective occupation of Africa, the British government recognized the potential and importance of the econo› mic forces of their new colonies in the promotion of British interests overseas. In 1895 the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, revealed this aware› ness to Parliament quite clearly: It is our business in all these new countries to make smooth the path for British commerce, British enterprise, the application of British capital, at a time when other paths, other outlets for the commercial energies of our race are being gradually closed by the commercial principles which are gaining more and more adhesion ...
In a few years it will be our people that will be masters, it will be our commerce that will prevail, it will be our capital that will rule ...
My Lords, this is a tremendous power, but it requires one condition.
You must enable it to get to the country where its work is to be done. You must open the path. 2
Indeed, the path was open, and each colonial state apparatus created and maintained effective conditions for the 'orderly' running of economic activities in the colony. These included the maintenance of'law and order' which facilitated effective exploitation of colonial resources, both human and material.
* ****: By the second decade of the present century the British had firmly estab› lished themselves in many parts of tropical Africa including Nigeria, Gold Coast (now Ghana), The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Nyasaland (now Malawi), Uganda, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa (see Fig. 2.1) and the colonial economies were clearly taking shape. This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.
The British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.
* **Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)**: Nowhere in West Africa had there been a longer tradition of confrontation between Africans and Europeans than in the Gold Coast between the Asante and the British. This started in the 1760s and culminated in a military engagement in 1824 in which the Asante defeated the British forces and their allies and killed their commander, Sir Charles MacCarthy, the then Governor of the Gold Coast.$^{39}$ Two years later, the British avenged this defeat at the battle of Dodowa. In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast. Above all, the Asantehene was deposed partly as a result of the outcome of the 1874
* ****: All these guiding principles were made clear, explicitly or implicitly, to the colonial administrators. But there was an equally important assumption which seems to have been confused by some colonial administrators and other apologists of colonialism and this is the fact that the British, like other colonizers, went out to the colonies primarily, if not exclusively, to enrich themselves and promote their own interests. The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas. Such a state of affairs was in no way a peculiarity of a few colonies. It was the normal reality of colonial economic relations. And since such relations are predominantly economic, colonial practice was conditioned by economic laws. 1

* **The Past, Present, and Future**: Sir,—As time goes by and brings its revenges, we do not mock at the present destruction of Kumasi by the British Government (although as individuals we have reason enough to do so), but we think the matter worthy of notice. June 15, 1807, was a sad time for the Fantees, especially of this town, with its near and remote neighbourhoods. Then, again, Sir Charles McCarthy arrived at the Coast some time in March, 1822, and on January 21, 1824, was fought the fatal battle, Essamacow. On May 21 of the same year, another battle was fought at Effootoo, and on the 11th and 13th of July, within sight of Cape Coast, another battle also was fought, with some loss to the Ashantees, by Colonel Sutherland. On the 26th of August, 1826, at Accra, in the plain of Doodowah, another battle was fought by Major Purdon, with a crushing loss to the Ashantees. After three or four years, negotiations took place between the Ashantees and the Protectorate (in 1830), under Governor Maclean. In 1853 the Ashantee force came, but returned, without making any attack. During this time, the Honourable Geo. Blankson was sent to Kumasi by the authorities at Cape Coast to open the roads for trade. He succeeded in this. In the year 1863 the Ashantee force came again, and battles took place at Essicoomah, and then at Bobicoomah. Since then, palaver goes, palaver comes, palaver goes, palaver comes, all the time, with some handsome presents sent up to Kumasi now and then to his Majesty the King by the merchants, with a view to cool his heart to open the path for business; but all to no purpose, and it ends with the war of 1873 and the present year, 1874.

Had the monarch any idea that the time was so changed and unlike that the year 1874 would bring him and his kingdom a grievous, sufficient, and equal reply to the disaster of Essamacow in 1824, he would not have sent down his people into this Protectorate in such a manner. Had he known that after fifty years from Sir Charles' time, Kumasi also would be conquered and taken by the British Government, he would have learned wisdom and avoided the trouble which has now come upon him.

Our reflection on these things, dear Mr. Editor, are, that Providence will yet make the whole Gold Coast, with Ashantees, &c., one country under the British Government; one flag, all brothers—only the wild King to be locked up, and let the people rest.—I am, Sir, your most obedient and humble servant,

## The portrayal of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence may have been exaggerated by both African and European observers, reflecting a colonial perspective that viewed African societies as needing European intervention.

The portrayal of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence may have been exaggerated by both African and European observers, reflecting a colonial perspective that viewed African societies as needing European intervention. The General History of Africa textbook does not specifically address Kumasi in this context, but it discusses the broader theme of how African societies were often misrepresented by European observers through a colonial lens that justified intervention. For example, it highlights the colonial perspective that dismissed African cultures as lacking history and civilization, aligning with the claim that such portrayals were exaggerated. It also mentions the discarding of certain customs, like human sacrifice, under colonial influence, suggesting these practices were not as widespread as colonial narratives implied. In contrast, The African Times news articles explicitly depict Kumasi as a "blood-deluged town" and a "vile slaughter-house," emphasizing its association with human sacrifice and the "natural ferocity" of its leaders. These articles also note exaggerated population estimates, indicating that fear and admiration may have distorted perceptions of Kumasi's significance, supporting the claim of colonial influence. However, the articles do not acknowledge any colonial bias or exaggeration in their reporting, instead expressing satisfaction with Kumasi's destruction as a justified act against a "wanton shedder of human blood." This lack of self-awareness about potential biases contrasts with the claim's suggestion of exaggerated portrayals. Together, these observations illustrate how colonial perspectives may have influenced the portrayal of African societies, including Kumasi, to justify European intervention.

* **The colonial impact > The impact in the social field**: Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and
* **Change and continuity**: Nor is the 'traditional-modern' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku'ranic and Western schools.
Thus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant 'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of "civilization" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as 'enthusiastically and successfully' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting 'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives'$^{3}$ available to them.

* **KUMASI BURNT AND DESTROYED**: Retribution has fallen on the capital of Ashanti. Kumasi is no more! The Avenger of Blood has been there! Purifying flame has passed over the gore-drenched soil. The palace—from which not only was the fiat of death diurnally issuing, but which was itself the head-quarters of human sacrifice, offered to gratify the natural ferocity or superstitious dread of its chief occupant, mined, blown up, and finally burned, is now, like the town, a heap of ruins. When Captain Sartorius, sent by Captain Glover to greet Sir Garnet Wolseley, passed through Kumasi, some days after the act of purification had begun, these ruins were still smoking, and not one living being was to be found there. The desolation was for the time complete. May it ever be so; for if the dying agonies of myriads of torturingly murdered human beings had a voice that reached to heaven, it was a spot to be for ever accursed, and against which vengeance could only have slumbered. We do not write against Ashanti as a conquering State—against its kings and chiefs as always thirsting for increased dominion and power. For characteristics such as these, we might equally denounce some civilized nations. We have denounced and do write against Ashanti, as a wanton shedder of human blood, for which it was ever athirst, which was its daily and hourly stimulant, and of which it would have drained the last drop from the Fanti countries, as it has done from many other interior ones, had not the protecting flag of Great Britain floated over the Castle at Cape Coast. That such a kingdom should be divested of the power it has hitherto possessed for gratifying such demon-like propensities, is surely a result that may well be regarded with satisfaction and rejoicing even by those whose principles are the most opposed to war. Kumasi has fallen! And here it is natural that we should draw attention to the ridiculous magnitude and importance which fear—fear of prisoners and visitors—had given to this blood-deluged town. Its population, though variously estimated, was by every one placed at a high figure; and yet all who have taken part in Sir Garnet Wolseley's expedition seem to agree that it could not have ever contained more than ten thousand inhabitants. We are not surprised at this. Kumasi could scarcely have been an attractive place of residence even for Ashantees. It was wanting in one very material point, and that is the element of security. The sacrifice of others, their torture, the perpetual smell of human blood and putrifying human flesh, may have been delicious; but the great human tiger was too near, and every man's life too much at his mercy, to allow of the enjoyment being satisfactory. We have, however, alluded to this scant population of a place reported to be very populous, principally to show how grossly exaggerated are the estimates of Africans, and even those of Europeans, when the objects are seen through the mists of native African fear and admiration. In conclusion, we must express the belief that there will be a new Kumasi, either on the old or on some new site, the latter being the most probable; and the hope that it may attain to and deserve a reputation diametrically opposed to that of the vile slaughter-house which has been so righteously destroyed.

## The journey from inland regions like Kumasi to coastal areas was a significant undertaking, reflecting the geographical and infrastructural challenges of the time.

The claim that the journey from inland regions like Kumasi to coastal areas was a significant undertaking due to geographical and infrastructural challenges is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa highlights the limited railway infrastructure, which primarily served export routes from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or minerals, with few lateral connections, indicating that travel from inland regions like Kumasi to the coast would have been challenging. It also discusses the strategic importance of controlling trade routes and posts on the coast for the Asante, suggesting that the journey was significant for maintaining economic and political power. Additionally, the shift from the slave trade to palm oil as a leading export would have influenced the nature and importance of these journeys. In contrast, The African Times describes a journey that began on Sunday, April 23rd, at Kwisa and ended on Friday, April 28th, at Cape Coast, taking a total of five days. This timeframe does not directly support the claim of significant geographical or infrastructural challenges, as the duration does not inherently indicate difficulty. However, the mention of being "exactly five weeks away" could imply that the entire trip, including the return or other activities, was lengthy, though this is not explicitly linked to the journey's difficulty. While The African Times provides a timeline, it lacks specific details about challenges such as difficult terrain or lack of infrastructure, which are necessary to fully support the claim. Together, these observations suggest that while the journey was strategically important and potentially challenging, the evidence from The African Times does not fully corroborate the extent of the difficulties implied by the claim.

* **Infrastructure**: One of the most important aspects of marketing is infrastructure. The construction of railways, roads, telegraph lines and harbours received the attention of the colonial administrations quite early on. Though these facilities helped in the general administration, their main task was to evacuate exports. No wonder therefore that the location and general direc› tion of railways and roads took little account of the general welfare of the dependencies. Most railways ran directly from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. Only a few lateral and inter-colonial links were established. Railways therefore served only limited areas, and, important as they have been, their role in 'opening up' the continent has certainly been exaggerated.$^{86}$ Only in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa were there more sophisticated railway networks, mainly intended to connect and serve the widely-scattered mining areas and settler farming regions. The cocoa belt of the southern Gold Coast, too, was well served by railways, while the Northern Territories with no export crops, were completely ignored. (See Figs 16.2, 16.3.)
Most of the railways were constructed, owned, and operated by govern› ments or official agencies. Construction of the first railway in British West Africa took place in Sierra Leone during the 1890s. The first train started operating in the colony area in 1897, and by 1909 the main line, crossing the rich palm oil belt to Pendembu, in the east (365 km) had been completed. A branch line from Bubuyan to Makeni in the north (132 km) was opened in 1915. Soon after the work started in Sierra Leone, other dependencies followed her example with even better results. All major lines were built by 1920. In Tanganyika the British inherited the two railways constructed by the Germans earlier during the twentieth century.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels**: The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.
While Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend. Silks and carpets from Turkey and Tripoli, natron from Borno, and Hausa textiles, were exchanged for kola nuts, gold, cotton materials from Dagomba, Mossi and Mande, shea butter and livestock from the Sudanese Sahel.
