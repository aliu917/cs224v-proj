The claim that the Ashanti Kingdom's control and influence over its vassal states and neighboring tribes were challenged due to its oppressive rule and military demands is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the Ashanti's imposition of political domination and military demands on other Akan peoples, leading to frequent clashes and wars with groups such as the Akyem, Akuapem, and Fante. It also discusses the Ashanti's military and political control over non-Akan states like the Dagomba, Mamprusi, and Gonja, emphasizing economic exploitation and the use of these states' manpower in Ashanti wars. The textbook further describes confrontations with the British, which eventually led to the disintegration of the Ashanti empire, and notes the Ashanti's expansion and control over various kingdoms required to pay tribute, indicating oppressive rule. Additionally, the Asante's attempts to enforce claims over territories like Elmina, Assin, Denkyira, and Akyem led to conflicts with the British. Similarly, The African Times provides details that support the claim, describing how states such as Adansi, Becqua, and Juabin sought to secede from Ashanti's rule due to oppression and the desire for independence, being held together more by fear of punishment than by loyalty. It also details the refusal of the Quocofocoos and the people of Konton-Assie to submit to the Ashanti King, Koffee Carry Carry, due to his oppressive actions, including the killing of chiefs and conscription for war, leading to a loss of support and allegiance. Both sources collectively illustrate the challenges to Ashanti's control stemming from its oppressive rule and military demands, aligning with the claim.

The claim that the British military intervention and campaigns against the Ashanti Kingdom, including the capture and destruction of Kumasi, were part of a broader strategy to consolidate control over the Gold Coast region is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa outlines a series of British actions aimed at weakening Ashanti influence and consolidating control, such as the capture and burning of Kumasi in 1874, the Treaty of Fomena which forced the Ashanti to renounce their rights on the Gold Coast, and the annexation of Ashanti in 1901. These actions, including the deposition of anti-British chiefs and imposition of taxes, illustrate a pattern of strategic maneuvers to consolidate British rule. The African Times adds context by highlighting the political fragmentation within the Ashanti Kingdom, suggesting that British intervention might have been seen as an opportunity to support the secession of smaller states, aligning with the strategic consolidation claim. It also reflects on the historical tensions between the Ashanti and the British, framing the 1874 actions as part of a continuum of engagements to subdue Ashanti power. However, it contrasts this view by describing the destruction of Kumasi as a moral retribution against Ashanti practices, suggesting a moral justification for British actions. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that incorporates both strategic and moral dimensions of the British campaigns against the Ashanti Kingdom.

The claim that the Ashanti Kingdom's focus on warfare and territorial expansion hindered the development of trade routes and economic growth, creating a monopoly that stifled the economic potential of neighboring tribes, is addressed with nuanced perspectives from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the Ashanti's interest in political domination and sovereignty over other Akan peoples, leading to frequent clashes and wars, such as those with the Akyem and Akuapem over trade routes. This suggests a link between the Ashanti's military pursuits and control over trade routes, but it does not explicitly state that this hindered economic growth or created a monopoly that stifled neighboring tribes' economic potential. Instead, it emphasizes the Ashanti's imposition of political structures and tribute systems, indicating a focus on economic development through tribute and integration of Asante institutions. This suggests that while the Ashanti were involved in warfare and territorial expansion, they also sought economic benefits, complicating the claim that their focus solely hindered economic growth. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by describing how the Ashanti Kingdom maintained control over its vassal states through fear and punishment, monopolizing trade and preventing tribes rich in gold and cotton from reaching the sea to trade with Europeans. The articles note that Kumasi, the Ashanti capital, served as a barrier (*ne plus ultra*) for trade routes, effectively stifling the economic potential of neighboring tribes. However, they do not explicitly state that warfare was the sole reason for the lack of economic development, leaving room for other contributing factors. Together, these sources provide a complex view of the Ashanti Kingdom's impact on regional trade and economic growth, highlighting both political and economic motivations behind their actions.

The decline of Kumasi and the Ashanti Kingdom is a multifaceted issue, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook attributes the decline primarily to military defeats, internal conflicts, and external pressures, such as the British military campaign that captured and burnt Kumasi in 1874, leading to the Treaty of Fomena and the subsequent weakening of the Ashanti Kingdom. It highlights the disintegration of the Ashanti Empire and the independence of its vassal states, as well as internal conflicts like the civil war between Kumasi and Dwaben. These factors emphasize military and political instability rather than issues of leadership or infrastructure. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the neglect and decay of infrastructure in Kumasi, noting the deterioration of roads, the fall of houses, and the desolate appearance of the town, which aligns with the claim of neglect. They also mention the absence of a king and the poor condition of the palace, suggesting a lack of strong leadership. However, the articles do not address the strategic location for trade or the inability to capitalize on it, nor do they explicitly connect these issues to the broader decline. Thus, while the articles support the claim regarding neglect and leadership, the textbook emphasizes military and political factors, providing a more comprehensive view of the decline.

The claim that the British viewed the integration of the Gold Coast, including the Ashanti, under their governance as a means to bring stability and economic development to the region is partially supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa suggests that the British were primarily motivated by their own economic interests, focusing on exploiting the colonies for raw materials with little reciprocity, as highlighted in paragraphs [0] and [1]. While paragraph [4] describes British military efforts to weaken the Asante empire, which could be interpreted as attempts to bring stability, the emphasis appears to be more on diminishing Asante power rather than fostering economic development. Paragraph [9] further underscores the British focus on self-enrichment, with any colonial development being incidental. In contrast, The African Times articles, particularly paragraphs [0] and [1], emphasize the British aim of achieving stability through integration, as reflected in the notion of uniting the region under British rule with "one flag, all brothers." However, these articles do not explicitly mention economic development as a British motive, focusing instead on political and military control. The mention of trade roads opened by Geo. Blankson hints at economic considerations but is not directly linked to British intentions. Overall, while both sources acknowledge British efforts towards regional stability, the primary motivation appears to be economic exploitation rather than genuine development, with The African Times providing less emphasis on economic objectives.

The portrayal of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence may have been exaggerated by both African and European observers, reflecting a colonial perspective that viewed African societies as needing European intervention. The General History of Africa textbook does not specifically address Kumasi in this context, but it discusses the broader theme of how African societies were often misrepresented by European observers through a colonial lens that justified intervention. For example, it highlights the colonial perspective that dismissed African cultures as lacking history and civilization, aligning with the claim that such portrayals were exaggerated. It also mentions the discarding of certain customs, like human sacrifice, under colonial influence, suggesting these practices were not as widespread as colonial narratives implied. In contrast, The African Times news articles explicitly depict Kumasi as a "blood-deluged town" and a "vile slaughter-house," emphasizing its association with human sacrifice and the "natural ferocity" of its leaders. These articles also note exaggerated population estimates, indicating that fear and admiration may have distorted perceptions of Kumasi's significance, supporting the claim of colonial influence. However, the articles do not acknowledge any colonial bias or exaggeration in their reporting, instead expressing satisfaction with Kumasi's destruction as a justified act against a "wanton shedder of human blood." This lack of self-awareness about potential biases contrasts with the claim's suggestion of exaggerated portrayals. Together, these observations illustrate how colonial perspectives may have influenced the portrayal of African societies, including Kumasi, to justify European intervention.

The claim that the journey from inland regions like Kumasi to coastal areas was a significant undertaking due to geographical and infrastructural challenges is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa and The African Times. The General History of Africa highlights the limited railway infrastructure, which primarily served export routes from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or minerals, with few lateral connections, indicating that travel from inland regions like Kumasi to the coast would have been challenging. It also discusses the strategic importance of controlling trade routes and posts on the coast for the Asante, suggesting that the journey was significant for maintaining economic and political power. Additionally, the shift from the slave trade to palm oil as a leading export would have influenced the nature and importance of these journeys. In contrast, The African Times describes a journey that began on Sunday, April 23rd, at Kwisa and ended on Friday, April 28th, at Cape Coast, taking a total of five days. This timeframe does not directly support the claim of significant geographical or infrastructural challenges, as the duration does not inherently indicate difficulty. However, the mention of being "exactly five weeks away" could imply that the entire trip, including the return or other activities, was lengthy, though this is not explicitly linked to the journey's difficulty. While The African Times provides a timeline, it lacks specific details about challenges such as difficult terrain or lack of infrastructure, which are necessary to fully support the claim. Together, these observations suggest that while the journey was strategically important and potentially challenging, the evidence from The African Times does not fully corroborate the extent of the difficulties implied by the claim.
