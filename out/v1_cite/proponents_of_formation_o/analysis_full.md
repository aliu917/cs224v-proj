## The persecution of Jews in Europe during the late 19th century was a significant factor that influenced the movement towards the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.

The General History of Africa textbook does not address the persecution of Jews in Europe during the late 19th century or its influence on the movement towards establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, focusing instead on various historical events and movements in Africa, such as nationalist movements, colonial resistance, and religious influences. This absence of information highlights a notable gap in the textbook's coverage of this significant historical development. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide relevant insights into the claim by discussing the social persecution of Jews in Europe, particularly in Berlin, based on race and creed. This persecution is portrayed as unexpected and contrary to the humanitarian ideals of the time, potentially serving as a catalyst for a larger movement towards establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. The articles suggest that external pressures, such as persecution, might influence Jews to consider returning to Judea to build a nation. Additionally, they introduce the idea that internal motivations, such as a change in the Jewish people's own feelings and a desire to establish a glorious nation, could also drive the movement, adding complexity to the claim by suggesting both external and internal factors at play.

* **Popular reactions**: If the reforms were a consequence of foreign pressure, they were in turn the cause of violent xenophobia. Their net effect on everyday life was adverse and the Moroccans naturally associated them with the Europeans' daily more pervasive presence. 'The reason for price rises and famine is cohabitation with the Europeans', said al-Nâsirï.$^{44}$ Everyone wished to reduce contact with the foreigners to an absolute minimum; more, the ideal became a return to life of earlier times. All classes turned to a romantic ideology that beautified the past and resurrected tradition (ihya'al-sunnÆ). To restrict the Europeans' sphere of operations, the sultan dragged out every negotiation, which irritated the consuls and aroused cries of obstruction. 'We must discuss, discuss and discuss again, only good can come of it', Hasan I advised one of his representatives at Tangier.$^{45}$ The clerical orders demanded strict application of sharTa in all areas of social life and gave the word reform a very special meaning. It was, in the $^{ l}$ulama'''s view, not so much a matter of changing institutions, which was impossible in any event, but of returning to the code of the elders (salaf), those who set the Muslims their examples of greatness and justice. In opposition to the concept of nidhâm, reorganization of their army, bureaucracy and daily life, they set up the notion of islah, personal moral and religious renewal. This was the movement called salafism (Muslim fundamentalism).$^{46}$ The urban man-inthe-street thought back with nostalgia to the good old days when food and goods were cheap, and when personal needs and the Makhzen's requirements were limited. For those who appeared to him clearly respon› sible for the current difficulties, he nourished a mixture of fear, admiration, scorn and hatred. The people's xenophobia, the $^{ <}$ulamä"s salafism and the Makhzen's conservatism were expressions of their experience: the decadence of their earlier society when confronted with nineteenth-century liberal capitalism. Morocco's political and religious elite was violently antiliberal at the time. 'There is no possible doubt whatever that liberty as the Europeans understand it is an innovation of atheistic libertines, since it denies the rights of God, parents, and even human nature itself'.$^{47}$ The positive value of the dialectic by which Moroccan
* **Egypt > Egyptian initiatives and reaction to British conquest 1882-1914**: In 1893 the Egyptian nationalist movement began to emerge from this quiescent phase when certain Egyptian elements started to criticize and resist the British occupation of Egypt. First among them was the ambitious new Khedive 'Abbas Hilmï ('Abbâs II, 1892-1914), who encouraged the development of a nationalist movement demanding the immediate evacu› ation of the British. His financial assistance to the press, which enabled the movement to become articulate, was of particular importance. During the first three years of his reign, 'Abbas placed himself at the forefront of this movement and he became a very real challenge to the autocratic rule of Lord Cromer, the British Agent and Consul-General, and succeeded in forcing the pro-British prime minister to resign on 15 January 1893. Although he was unable after that to act so openly owing to pressure from the British, Hilmï nevertheless attracted some dedicated recruits who were willing to carry on the struggle against the British occupation. They were a group of young intellectuals, who were familiar with the ideas of the French revolution and with modern social and political theories.$^{9}$ The old Egyptian society with its strict code and religious restrictions was, in fact, gradually breaking up, a development that led to considerable instability. The educated Egyptians were particularly alarmed by the British domin› ation of the civil service, the only area of advancement that remained open to them. By 1905, 42% of the higher posts were occupied by the British, 30% by Armenians and Syrians, and only 28% by Egyptians. $^{l}$ ° The most vehement opponents of British rule at that time were Mustafa Kâmil, a charismatic leader and eloquent orator, and his Nationalist Party. Kâmil had at first concentrated his efforts on winning European support for the cause of Egypt's independence. He had apparently felt that other European states were so jealous of the British occupation of Egypt that they would actively support any attempts to remove them. With generous funds supplied by the Khedive, Kâmil toured European capitals during the period 1895-8 where he addressed meetings, gave interviews to news› papers, and wrote articles and pamphlets. ' $^{1}$ These activities aroused a great deal of interest in Europe, but that was as far as it went. KämiPs optimistic belief that Europe in general, and France in particular, would
* **Towards confrontation > New tactics, and obstructions to action**: In Algeria the administration tried to limit the spreading influence of the 'Ulama', mustering against them both the religious brotherhoods and the official clergy, the latter of extremely low standard.$^{63}$ The authorities, seeing the people flock to hear the new preachers, whom they instinctively recognized as presenting a necessary updating of Islam, decided to forbid them to preach in the mosques. On 16 February 1933 the 'Michel Circular' - named after the official who drew it up - and three supporting decrees, set up an official monopoly to this effect.$^{64}$ Not only believers but also trade unionists and militants of the extreme Left took part in the demonstration that followed - a coalition which might have proved effective. Admittedly there occurred at that point a kind of 'divorce' between the Communist and nationalist tendencies,$^{65}$ which was far from healed by the reunification of the CGT and the CGTU in 1935. After several years of clandestine activity, the Etoile nord-africaine resumed open activity in Algeria itself in June 1933.$^{66}$ Mesalï Hâdj, its president, had been using the word independence since 1927. And now, amidst the growing uneasiness, there was an anti-Jewish riot at Constantine in August 1934.$^{67}$ Whether this was a plot, a mere explosion, a diversion, or the result of provocation was not clear. But, whatever it was, it was a street outbreak which frightened all the politicians by its violence. Yet at the next elections, in January 1935, the opposition list of Dr Bendjellßl carried the day in Constantine: this showed in which direction the sympathies of the majority were tending. Although the victor was a convinced assimilationist,$^{68}$ he aroused the prevailing powers to a fury of preventive measures. Clearly, what mattered in this vague radicalization of public life in Algeria was not the theory expressed but what it suggested or actually provoked.
* **Towards confrontation > New tactics, and obstructions to action**: In Morocco, the settlers, embittered by the slump and irritated by such few limits as the administration imposed upon them, issued an ultimatum. This development, full of symbolic significance, occurred on the same day as the disorders in Paris on 6 February 1934. The same period saw in Morocco the rise of a nationalist press. The Moroccan Action Committee, in which 'Allai al-Fâsï was beginning to stand out as a leading figure, put forward a 'Reform Plan' on 1 December 1934, which if adopted would have developed its real significance and object in the course of the Protectorate.$^{69}$ In the Spanish zone, opposition was already being expressed more openly through Torres and Nâsirï;$^{70}$ it established contacts up country,$^{71}$ and almost compromised the future Mohammed V in a demonstration in Fez on 10 May 1934.
* **Egypt > The era of negotiations, 1924-35**: The various Palace governments that ruled Egypt before 1935, particu› larly that of SidkT (1930-3), took repressive measures against the Wafd. Its leaders were imprisoned, newspapers were banned and supporters were dismissed from their posts in the government and civil service. Besides their endorsement of these extreme measures, the colonial administrators occasionally took direct measures to humiliate the Wafd. For instance, Zaghlül was not allowed on two occasions, in 1924 and 1926, to become prime minister, though his party had a majority in parliament.
This Palace-Residency suppressive campaign led to a gradual decline in the Wafd's popularity and erosion of its unity. Dissatisfied with what they called the 'uninspired leadership'$^{14}$ of Nahhäs, ZaghlüPs successor, a group of Wafd leaders deserted the party in 1932. Being less able and willing to confront colonialism, the majority of the Wafd leaders therefore decided in the mid-i93os to strengthen themselves against the Palace by a deal with Britain. '$^{s}$ To achieve this, they were bound to compromise on the nation's demands. The upshot of this weakness was the conclusion of the 1936 treaty that legalized British occupation of Egypt and maintained the British-dominated administration in the Sudan.
* **The victims of the crisis**: What were the reactions of the victims? First of all, they expressed the 'fatalistic' resignation which, in the eyes of all European observers of Muslim society in the nineteenth century, could not be too forcefully condemned. In 1892, Masqueray wrote with reference to the Muslims in Algeria: 'Resignation is even stronger than anger in this astonishing world of Islam' or, more appropriately, 'in this new confederation of paupers'. 54 This attitude, like the will to fight that had existed in the past, seems to have contributed quite naturally to reinforcing the positions of local saints and brotherhoods as the few bastions of resistance in a disintegrating society.$^{55}$ In the very first years of the nineteenth century, there were distinct signs of a reactivation of the brotherhood system. This trend probably bore some relation to the serious events that were unsettling the established order in certain parts of the world at that time and which affected the Maghrib itself: it was apparent among the Darkäwiyya masses, who rebelled against Turkish rule in the early 1800s; among the Tijäniyya notables, who laid emphasis on meditation and were inclined to compromise with the authorities, even the French after 1830; and among the Kadirlyya and Rahmäniyya, who led, from time to time, the struggle against the occupying power. The phenomenon has been particularly well observed, not to say highlighted, in Algeria, where the destruction of the scholarly and urban aspects of Islamic life and, more generally, of the traditional fabric of society, is said to have caused the mass of the Muslim population to turn once more for inspiration to the zäwiyas (sanctuaries) and brother› hoods.$^{56}$ In nineteenth-century Tunisia too, it seems to the present writer that the brotherhoods gave proof of fresh vitality after a long period of comparative apathy and that certain saints or representatives of brother› hoods played a prominent role at that time.$^{57}$ The trend was even more pronounced in Morocco, the land where zäwiyas and brotherhoods flour› ished most.
* **Somaliland > Local protest movements**: The Italians faced an even more serious resistance in the Midjurtayn Sultanate. Its reputable Sultan, 'Uthmän Mahmud, refused the inferior status assigned by the colonialists to himself and his people. In spite of colonial repression, his movement continued to thrive, and he held out against the invaders for almost two years. He was, however, arrested towards the end of 1927 to be treated in the same manner as his kinsman Yüsuf.$^{37}$ But the struggle continued under the leadership of his son and heir apparent, Herzi Bogor.
Supported by the traditional chiefs who urged an outright war, Herzi attacked the Italian bases at Ras Hafun, and early in December 1925 drove an Italian garrison out of Hordio. A second large attack six weeks later threatened Italian installations at Cape Guardafui. Herzi made another daring assault on Eil at the mouth of the Nogal.$^{38}$ Again the colonialists reacted in their predictable manner: making arrests and deporting leaders. As for Herzi he went to Ethiopia, but returned after several years to Mogadishu where he died of smallpox.
* **European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914 > Liberia**: Neither invited to, nor represented at, the Berlin Conference, Liberia at first refused to be bound by its decisions such as the principle of 'effective occupation' on the ground. As Liberia's Secretary of State, Edwin J. Barclay stated in June 1887, the Liberian view was that the Berlin decisions 'refer to further acquisitions of African territory by European powers and not to the present possessions or future acquisition of an African state'.$^{21}$ The Liberians insisted, correctly, that being an African government and country, Liberia required no 'effective occupation' since all the inhabitants were Liberians.
In the end, to avoid losing Liberia's entire hinterland, the Liberian government commenced measures from the late 1890s for effective occupation. Liberia's President from 1904 to 1911, Arthur Barclay, aptly stated the issues at stake, arguing in December 1906 that: Liberia was a recognized state long before the Berlin Conference ... and there might be ground on its part to question some of the dicta laid down at that Conference. But it is a fact that the great powers really settle the principles of international law. Small states must conform. It results, therefore, that we are compelled to occupy our frontiers with a frontier guard, suitable officials, and give to the frontier district an organized government on civilized lines. 22 European imperialism in Liberia during the Scramble and partition occurred in three main forms: (1) expropriation of Liberian territory by European powers; (2) gross interference in Liberia's internal affairs by them and; (3) control of Liberia's economy by European merchants, financiers, concessionaires and entrepreneurs who enjoyed the confidence and patronage of these powers. European imperialist activities in Liberia further weakened and destabilized her.
* **Islam and colonial rule**: But Muslims also opposed colonial rule on both religious and political grounds, and although colonial administrations, such as the French, succeeded in gaining a measure of Muslim support in their West African territories, there were large numbers of Muslims who were bent on preserving the purity of Islam and who could therefore not tolerate submission to a Christian infidel administration, and they sought to rid their countries of French colonialism. Such a desire led to the resurgence of Mahdism which was to end the rule of the unbeliever. The Mahdï, the equivalent of the Christian Messiah, was believed to be the one who would come into the world to establish a just government in accordance with Islamic dogma and finally rid society of the rule of unbelievers. Mahdism reared its head in many parts of the Sudanic zone of West Africa as an expression of anti-French sentiment in Upper Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal, especially from 1906 to the First World War.
Other Islamic movements which expressed an anti-French or anticolonial posture were the Hamalliyya movement, founded by Shaykh Hamallah, which was active in Senegal, French Soudan, Mauritania and Niger and the Sanüsiyya brotherhood, founded by Muhammad b. 'All al-Sanßsï in Libya which became the force which led the Libyans against Italian colonialism. Between i860 and 1901 the Sanüsiyya spread to Tunisia, Egypt, the central Sahara, central Sudan and Senegal.
* **The economic and political setting in Southern Africa and the Belgian Congo: an overview > Popular protest, nationalism and politics in South Africa and the surrounding territories**: The ideology of these churches had much in common. There was, in the first place, the idea that, in the true teaching of Christ, blacks are equal in everything, and that the European missionaries were distorting the Bible. Messianism was a feature of Afro-Christian churches, with their belief in the second advent of the Saviour - this time a black one. The second advent, the adherents of these churches and sects believed, would usher in a thousand-year rule of good and justice, while colonialists would be driven out of Africa. ' 3 Independent churches, both of the Zionist and Ethiopian varieties, were particularly widespread in South Africa and represented an important form of dissent. Their numbers spread rapidly. In 1918 there were seventy-six; by 1932 the number had increased to 320; and a decade later there were more than 800.$^{14}$ From the standpoint of social movements, the separatist Ethiopian churches, with their elected officials, flags, charters and para› military organizations, represented the assertion, within the framework of the Church, of the claim for African self-government. Similarly, the Zionist churches were often led by charismatic anti-European prophets who held out an apocalyptic vision and the hope of a reconstructed society free of oppression and white rule. ' 5 Despite close state surveillance, independent churches periodically engaged in explicit insurgent activities. As early as 1884 Nehemiah Tile, a Methodist preacher, had urged his adherents in Tembuland to disregard state officials.$^{16}$ In 1921 an Ethiopian sect known as the Israelites under the leadership of Enoch Mgijima forcibly resisted removal from a squatter settlement in Queenstown. The Israelites contended that the New Testa› ment, a fiction of the white man's, must be disregarded and that if they worshipped the ancient Hebraic forms, Jehovah would ultimately liberate them from the yoke of oppression. Even as a large police and military force approached, the Israelites, armed only with swords and spears, remained defiant. 'Jehovah tells us that we are not to allow you to burn our huts, or drive away our people from Ntabelanga, or allow you to arrest the men you wish to arrest."$^{7}$ The soldiers, armed with machine guns, killed 163 Israelites and wounded 129.
* **The Sudan > The Mahdist risings**: Although under British colonial rule the Mahdist sect was outlawed, a sizeable section of the Sudanese community remained Mahdist at heart. The majority expressed their resentment of British rule by continuing to read the ratïb (the Mahdfs prayer-book) and to practise other Mahdist rituals. But a dedicated Mahdist minority repeatedly tried to topple the 'infidel' rule by force. Hardly a year passed between 1900 and 1914 without a Mahdist rising in the northern Sudan. The main source of inspiration and strength for these risings was the Muslim doctrine of Nabt 'Isa (Prophet Jesus). It was generally believed among Muslims that the Mahdï would reappear in order to bring justice to the world after it had been filled with injustice. But his mission would be temporarily halted by altnasïh al-dadjdjäl (the anti-Christ). Nabï$^{ l}$Tsä would, however, soon appear in order to secure the permanence of the glorious Mahdiyya. The Ansär had apparently identified the British with al-dadjdjäl and many of them assumed the Hsâship to expel them from the country. 35 Mahdist uprisings occurred in February 1900, in 1902-3 and in 1904. But the most important of these Mahdist risings was organized and led in 1908 by a distinguished Mahdist, \Abd al-Kâdir Muhammad Imam, usually called Wad Habüba. Wad Habüba preached Mahdism in the Djazïra and defied the government from his camp in Tukür village near Kamlïn. A government force advanced towards him, but it was resisted and two government officials were killed in this encounter. While the authorities were shocked by this incident, Wad Habüba launched a surprise attack in May on the enemy at the village of Katflya.
* **The Maghrib states and the Europeans**: The nineteenth-century colonialist drive in North Africa was unusual in being a sequel to earlier campaigns (see Fig. 5.2).
The Moroccan government had for four centuries been resisting the Spaniards who had established themselves at Ceuta and Melilla. It always forbade the inhabitants to have anything to do with them; and it was to break this blockade that Spain launched the 1859-60 war that was so disastrous for Morocco. She was forced to pay a heavy fine, to agree to the enlargement of the fortified part of Melilla and to cede a port on the Atlantic coast as a refuge for fishermen from the Canary Islands. 6 With the acquisition of the bay of Rio de Oro - whose occupation was notified on 26 December 1884, to the signatories to the Berlin Act on the division of Africa into zones of influence - Spain by the end of the century had three bridgeheads on the North African coast.
In 1880 and 1881, when the Madrid Conference on the protection of individuals in Morocco met in two sessions, the Makhzen made a last attempt to get its independence and sovereignty over a clearly defined territory accepted at the international level. Despite English support, the attempt failed in the face of the selfish alliance of France, Spain and Italy. France, which had briefly thought all was lost in Morocco, raised the Tuât problem immediately after the end of this conference. Indeed, there was much talk in Paris at the time about the plan for a trans-Saharan railway line, which would open up Central Africa to French trade. But the plan ran up against a serious obstacle: the oases of the central Sahara were politically dependent on Morocco. France tried to convert the Sultan to her view, but buttressed by English support, he rejected the French demands while at the same time strengthening his administrative and political presence in Tuât.
In the east of the Maghrib, the Tunisians had for centuries been fight› ing the Italians as the Moroccans had been fighting the Spanish. United Italy certainly had designs on the Regency of Tunis: it sent immigrants there, invested capital there and propagated its culture there. But the real danger threatening Tunisia came from France, which had already been established in Algeria for over half a century.
* **Towards an imperialist policy**: Tripolitania and Morocco succeeded in postponing a European occu› pation. The chief claimant as regards Tripoli was Italy, which had been watching the struggle for Tunisia anxiously in the years preceding 1881, but it was only at the beginning of the 1880s that it began pressing its claims.$^{20}$ In 1884-5,$^{ tne}$ Italian High Command prepared plans for war. However, owing to a lack of agreement among the imperialist powers, their execution had to be postponed.$^{21}$ For the same reason, Morocco was able to avoid foreign occupation until the end of the nineteenth century. However, its attempts to curtail the privileges and high-handedness of foreigners suffered a setback. At a conference of the European powers and the USA, held in Madrid in 1880, Moroccan sovereignty was once again subjected to restrictions and it was announced that no changes could be made in the administration of the country without the prior consent of the powers that attended the conference.
In the Muslim world, the carving up and occupation of the greater part of North Africa were regarded as a fresh outrage against Islam. The struggle of the North African fighters for the Faith met with support (in most cases moral support only) in Istanbul and in other countries of the East.$^{22}$ Relying on this support, new attempts were made in Algeria and Tunisia to arrest colonization by force of arms: these were the uprisings led by Bü Amäma in Algeria, in 1881, and by 'AIT bin Khalifa in Tunisia in 1881-3. Despite the tenacity and heroism displayed b~y~the rebels, these uprisings failed to attain their objective. In point of fact, they had already become rearguard actions, the last-ditch attempts of a traditional society to defend the avenues of its idiosyncratic development on the basis of ancient moral and social structures, already undermined during the foreign conquest and the development of colonial capitalism.
* **European pressure on traditional society**: As the pacification proceeded, the Turks introduced reforms into the country, trying to establish administrative and legal organization along European lines. The governor, 'Uthman Amin Pasha (1842-7), reorganized the administration, system of justice, taxation laws, etc. in accordance with the principles of the Tanzimät. In 1851, a mixed court of justice was established in Tripoli and this at once strengthened the position of foreigners. All that, together with reforms that undermined the founda› tions of traditional society, caused dismay and gave rise to protests among the indigenous population, especially the nomadic groups and peasants. 'Turks and Europeans,' Sïdï Muhammad al-Mahdï, son of the founder of the Sanusï order used to say, 'are people tarred with the same brush'. 3
In Tunisia, reforms were begun in 1830 and continued by Ahmad Bey (1837-55),$^{an}$ ardent admirer of Muhammad 'AIL The regents of Tunis, in an attempt to overcome military and technological underdevelopment, disbanded the militia composed of janissaries and laid the foundations of a regular army and an armaments industry by importing machinery and equipment from Europe.
Following the example of Egypt, government monopolies were estab› lished, leading to the nationalization of the economy. A State Bank was founded (1847) and fiduciary currency was put into circulation. In 1841, Ahmad Bey prohibited the sale of slaves and abolished all forms of slavery in Tunisia. In 1838, a military college and a polytechnic school were established; Tunisians began to study foreign languages, to go abroad for their studies and to translate the works of European authors.
* **Egypt > The Urabist revolution**: Meanwhile the Khedive was conspiring behind the scenes to crush the revolution. To provide a pretext for foreign intervention - some Egyptian historians maintain - the Khedive and the British organized the Alexandria massacre of 12 June 1882 in which many foreigners were killed and a great deal of property was damaged.$^{6}$ Whether this accusation is true or not is irrelevant as the Khedive had in fact invited the British to intervene and they responded enthusiastically and quickly. But the Egyptian Cabinet unanimously decided to repel the invasion and rejected the British ulti› matum to desist from fortifying shore defences, and to dismantle gun emplacements around Alexandria. This gave the British fleet a further pretext to bombard Alexandria on 11 July 1882. The Egyptian army and people put up a gallant resistance against the invaders, but they were defeated by superior arms. About two thousand Egyptians were killed in this battle.
After the fall of Alexandria the Egyptian army withdrew to Kafr al-Dawär, a few miles away. By then, 'Urâbï had declared a djihäd against the British in a proclamation that was distributed to the Egyptian people. Fighting around Kafr al-Dawär broke out several times during August 1882. The solid resistance of the Egyptian army and people made it very difficult for the invaders to occupy Cairo from this direction. They there› fore decided to occupy the Suez Canal and launch a major attack against the capital from there.
The Egyptian masses readily sent financial support to their army and thousands of young people offered to join as conscripts. Nevertheless, all the odds were against the Egyptian resistance movement. 'Urâbï could not muster more than 16000 trained troops, and even this small number was dispersed around Kafr al-Dawär, Dimyät (Damietta) and the Suez Canal area. Moreover, the Egyptian army lacked training, modern arms and ammunition, and efficient means of transport. A modern army of 20000 men under the command of Sir Garnet Wolseley quickly crossed the Canal, occupied Ismailie, broke the backbone of the revolution in the battle of al-Tall al-Kabïr on 13 September 1882,$^{7}$ and occupied the country. Though the British had deceitfully promised speedy evacuation, the British occu› pation of Egypt was to last seventy-two years.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Balance of power**: F. H. Hinsley,$^{17}$ on the other hand, emphasizes Europe's need for peace and stability at home as the primary cause of the partition. According to him, the decisive date for the shift towards an extra-European age - an age of imperialism - was 1878. From that year, at the Congress of Berlin, Russian and British rivalries in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire brought the nations of Europe to the very verge of conflagration. European statesmen averted this crisis in power politics and drew back. Power politics from that point on to the Bosnian crisis of 1908 were removed from Europe and played out in Africa and Asia. When conflicting interests in Africa threatened to destroy European peace, the European powers had no choice but to carve up Africa in order to preserve the European diplomatic balance that had stabilized itself by the 1880s.
* **Egypt > The Urabist revolution**: The financial maladministration of Khedive Ismail (1863-79) and the huge loans that he borrowed from Europe had, by 1880, placed Egypt on the verge of bankruptcy. While half of Egypt's revenue had been strictly allocated to the service of these debts, heavy taxes were imposed on the Egyptian people and the fallähin (sing, falläh: 'peasant') majority who could not afford to pay them were mercilessly flogged. This economic hard› ship and humiliation created widespread discontent and bitter opposition to Khedive Tawfik (1879-92) and his corrupt government. Tawfîk was further despised for his total subservience to the European powers who took advantage of his weakness and Egypt's indebtedness to control the country's finance and government. It soon became virtually impossible for any Egyptian government to initiate any administrative or economic reform without the prior and unanimous approval of fourteen European powers. While the Egyptians were suffering all this misery, resident foreigners were leading a comfortable life. They were not even subject to the law of the land, but had their own laws and courts. Foreigners had, furthermore, exploited this privileged position to enrich themselves at the expense of the Egyptian masses; often through corrupt and immoral means. The desire to eradicate this humiliating and repugnant foreign domination was to prove a major reason for the outbreak of resistance led by Colonel Ahmad 'Urâbï: the Urabist revolution. 1
Another reason for it was the maturity of liberal political ideas among Egyptians as a result of the spread of education and the development of the press in the course of the nineteenth century. This maturity was largely responsible for the emergence and development of a constitutional move› ment in the country from the 1860s onwards, particularly among the western-educated Egyptians who opposed European control and Khedival absolutism. This movement found considerable support in the revolution› ary ideas of the Muslim reformers, Djamäl al-Dïn al-Afghânï and Muhammad 'Abduh. Led by Muhammad Sharif Pasha, who was nicknamed Abu al-Dastür (the father of the constitution), these constitutional national› ists pressed for the enactment of a liberal constitution and the formation of a representative government.$^{2}$ Some of them may even have hoped to overthrow Muhammad 'Alfs dynasty, which had ruled the nation since the turn of the century.
* **The world of the southern Mande**: Actually the disruption of the old order among the southern Mandinka had started south of Kankan, in Toron and Konyan, before al-Hadjdj 'Umar's visit. The most likely explanation is that the opening up in the eighteenth century of the routes to the Côte des RiviŁres had increased the size and importance of the Muslim trader element. The export of slaves produced by local wars was to continue until the middle of the nineteenth century for the clandestine export trade, and until the colonial conquest for use in Futa Jallon. Next, the need to import cloth and European arms became well-established. Essential as it was to society as a whole, the growing Joola minority became aware, through Islam, of the holy wars and Muslim theocracies in the north. The influence of the Futa came in through Kankan, and the kola-nut caravans went up as far as Shehu Ahmadu's Massina. The time came when the Joola and Muslim elements would no longer accept the place assigned them by society as a whole, while the society, ossified by tradition, was unable to reform. There followed a series of localized conflicts, from the north-western Ivory Coast to the upper Niger. But the resistance remained insurmountable. What was needed if the movement was to become general was the emergence of a local man obviously anxious to change, without destroying, the society from which he came, but sufficiently open to the outside world to promote new methods. This is what Samori did; and I have suggested calling the movement as a whole the Joola Revolution. It would, however, be the second such revo› lution, if the same name is used for the rise of the empire of Kong at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
* **The role of religious ideas**: Meanwhile historians have been re-examining the role of religious ideas in the resistances. What they have found bears little resemblance either to the 'fanatical witch-doctors' of colonial reports, or to 'the magic of despair'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that 'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for "primary resistances" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. 'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the 'high priestess' was dismissed and executed. 'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west. Some› times it happened because of the influence of Christian ideas - and Hendrik Wittboi drew upon Protestant Christianity for his doctrine of sovereignty, while an African independent Christian prophet was active among the Nama at the time of their rising against the Germans. Very often it happened in the context of African religion.
* **Stages of resistance > The failure of African initiatives and resistance**: We must remember that throughout the nineteenth century, a popular movement was growing up which advocated war to the death; it was disparaged by the 'ulama and the members of the Makhzen because it was accompanied by an appeal to the supernatural and belief in the millen› nium. There is an account of al-Hibä and his brother Murâbbih Rabbuh, on the eve of the battle of Bü 'Uthmän on 6 September 1912, calling on the angels to help the resistance fighters. At the time of the battle of 26 June 1922 there is mention of the Kerkür of Tafesaset, a rock at whose foot the colonial advance would supposedly stop on pain of a cosmic cataclysm.$^{45}$ This was a natural belief on the part of sherifs and clerics leading mostly unlettered peoples; but it was also an attitude which the urban elite was bound to regard as dangerous because it was archaic and unrealistic. Abu Shu'ayb al-Dukkâlï, one of the pioneers of the reformist movement, well expressed this critical attitude to this sort of resistance by saying of al-Hibä's action: 'I am against resistance fighters who give the Europeans excuses to occupy Muslim land, like Bü Amäma, the chiefs of the Shäwiya and the Banï Matïr, and many more whose number is countless in the East and the West'. 46 Just as there were two stages in colonial policy and two kinds of resistance, so likewise there were two quite distinct groups of resistance leader. Con› centrating on the phase of conquest and occupation, the phase of stubborn scattered resistance led by chiefs and Islamic clerics with millenarian ideas little to the taste of the urban elite, we find the following charac› teristics: (1) they had broken with the historic elite, which understood the real relative strengths of the colonial army and the indigenous fighters; (2) they expected a miracle to stave off the conquest; (3) they were disunited and scattered by exile, hunger and distrust; (4) they refused to accept what seemed inevitable after the event.

## The idea of Jews returning to Palestine was not initially popular among European Jews, who felt secure and prosperous in countries like England, France, and Germany.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting insights regarding the claim about the initial popularity of the idea of Jews returning to Palestine among European Jews. The General History of Africa does not provide any information directly related to this claim, as its focus is on colonialism, resistance, and socio-political dynamics in Africa, without addressing Jewish sentiments or movements concerning Palestine. In contrast, The African Times articles offer relevant information supporting the claim. They highlight that a spontaneous movement of Jews toward Palestine was not anticipated, as European Jews felt secure and prosperous in countries like England, France, and Germany. A conversation with a Jewish friend is mentioned, where the friend expressed a lack of enthusiasm for returning to Judea, asking, "Where can we be better off than here?" This sentiment aligns with the claim that European Jews felt secure and prosperous in their current countries. Additionally, the articles suggest that Jews were becoming notable for their wealth and monopolistic tendencies, which could lead to envy and persecution, potentially influencing a change in their feelings towards returning to Palestine. Thus, while the General History of Africa does not address the claim, The African Times provides evidence supporting the notion that the initial idea of returning to Palestine was not popular among European Jews.

But the settlers grew mostly soft wheat, intended for the French milling trade: in Tunisia, for example, nearly all the 160000 ha under soft wheat belonged to Europeans. In this sector too a drop in prices went hand in hand with a fall in exports; the value of European exports of Tunisian wheat, 291408000 francs in 1931, fell to 60845000 francs in 1934.

KASSAB > The economy from the end of the First World War to the economic crisis of 1929 > The disruption of rural society by agricultural colonization > The features of agricultural colonization**: Despite considerable efforts by the authorities to increase the French rural population, official colonization did not manage to establish many French settlers in the countryside of North Africa. Apart from smallholders in vineyards and orchards (Italians in Tunisia, Spaniards in Morocco), Euro› pean settlers did not constitute a real peasantry such as existed in France at that time. They were mainly large farmers owning enormous estates, a wide range of agricultural equipment and often impressive farm buildings. They had close links with the banks, the various agricultural credit bodies, the research institutes and the many administrative departments directly or indirectly concerned with colonization.
The agriculture they practised was essentially speculative and aimed at exporting their produce rather than selling it on the home market. Most settlers specialized in a single crop, such as vines, cereals or olives (in Tunisia). In the Oran area (Algeria) settler agricultural economy was almost wholly centred on vines, while in the high plains of Constantine and the plains of the Tunisian Tell cereal monoculture was the rule.
This specialization, applied to estates of several hundred hectares, made possible some rationalization of agricultural work and the systematic use of modern agricultural equipment. It was after the First World War that trac› tors, both tracked and wheeled, appeared in the North African countryside. They gradually became widespread, along with tractor-drawn equipment (ploughs with plough-shares, disc ploughs, multi-disc ploughs, culti› vators, drills, etc.). After reaper-binders, combine harvesters also became widespread, bringing enormous savings in agricultural manpower. The new machinery also made it possible to apply dry-farming techniques to cereal land on the semi-arid fringes of the Tell, and to expand the growing of wheat, particularly soft wheat.
At the same time much effort was put into agricultural economics research in the research institutes of Tunis, Algiers, Rabat, etc.; and this provided the settlers with new varieties of cereals, fruit trees, tobacco, etc. suited to the soils and climates of North Africa.
* **Conclusion**: Even if the lot of the subject peoples did not change much for the better in the years following the war, when even willing attempts at reform were aborted by the depression,$^{86}$ searching questions about the morality of colonialism had begun to be asked. And it was in this climate that the nationalist movement gestated that was eventually to obtain independence for many African countries. For example, leaders of the National Congress of British West Africa like J. E. Casely Hayford and H. C. Bankole-Bright were able to gain an international hearing through the League of Nations Union, concerning themselves with the administration of Togoland and appealing to the Covenant of the League as a charter for 'just treatment towards our people'. And at long range, the idea of the Mandate evolved into the post-Second World War concept of Trusteeship, which incorpor› ated the explicit goal of eventual independence for the Trust Territories which were to be visited by 'neutral' missions of inspection.
* **Beneficiaries of the crisis**: As elsewhere, the situation that prevailed in the Maghrtib in the nineteenth century produced its breed of profiteers. First of all, there were the European settlers, whose numerical strength stood at 164000 in 1855, 245 000 in 1872 and 375 000 in 1882 in Algeria.$^{44}$ In Tunisia, they numbered about 11000 in 1856, 14000 in 1870 and 19000 in 1881.$^{45}$ In Libya, the figures remained fairly low until the early years of the twentieth century. Although most of the Europeans in Algeria and Tunisia were of humble origin, they enjoyed, nonetheless, a very privileged status by comparison with the majority of local people. The same was true of a Jewish minority, which succeeded in playing a role, in some capacity or another, within the European capitalist network and took advantage of their position as intermediaries between these networks and the indigenous population.$^{46}$ There were some, though fewer, Muslims who succeeded in playing a similar role: those who became consular agents, brokers and, more frequently, business associates of European trading concerns who sought at the earliest opportunity to escape from the control of the Muslim authorities so as to benefit from the protection of the European consuls in Tunisia, Libya and Morocco.$^{47}$ Much better known were the high-ranking servants of the Makhzen, who misused their positions in order to build up huge fortunes thanks to the confusion prevailing in their troubled countries: for example, Mustafa Khaznadar, the Tunisian prime minister from 1837 to 1873, accumulated a sum amounting, at a conserva› tive estimate, to some 25 million francs, the greater part of which was invested in France. 48 The colonial officials in Algeria and the weakened authority of the bey in Tunisia had to rely, in rural areas, on certain influential persons who exercised a kind of 'feudal' power over the communities within their jurisdiction, for example Mukrânï in Algeria, until he rebelled and died in 1871,$^{49}$ and 'All bin Khalifa in south-eastern Tunisia from 1840 to 1881, before he decided irTthat year to head the resistance movement against France which subsequently led to his exile in Libya.$^{50}$ The same kind of trend seems to explain the rise of a number of religious families who monopolized, from generation to generation, the
* **The reaction of traditional society**: The ambitions of the colonists and omnipotence of the foreign tycoons, the very fact of the immigrants' increasing penetration in every sphere of national life aggravated the indigenous population of North Africa. Lib› erals$^{15}$ like Khäyr al-DTn, Husayn, Kabadu, and Muhammad Bayram in Tunisia ancHKoussantini in Algeria, who suffered at the sight of their countries' misfortunes and at the same time understood the need for reforms, were alone and cut off from the people. Napoleon Ill's 'civilizing policy' in Algeria, and the reforms in Tunisia and Tripolitania, met with incomprehension from the majority of the population, if not open hostility. It interpreted them as yet another stage in colonial subjection, like having to renounce the sharTa and Muslim personal identity. These reforms aroused particular animosity among the marabouts and the rural population. The peasants and nomads regarded the Europeanized Muslims as turncoats and refused to place any confidence in them. The folklore poetry$^{15}$ shows that the common run of Muslims were heartbroken at the collapse of the patriarchal past, felt themselves to be strangers in the 'century of dishon› our', 'without faith or law', and turned away from those who, according to the poet Mohand-ou-Mhand (1845-1906), had once been lions and were now under the yoke.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Balance of power**: F. H. Hinsley,$^{17}$ on the other hand, emphasizes Europe's need for peace and stability at home as the primary cause of the partition. According to him, the decisive date for the shift towards an extra-European age - an age of imperialism - was 1878. From that year, at the Congress of Berlin, Russian and British rivalries in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire brought the nations of Europe to the very verge of conflagration. European statesmen averted this crisis in power politics and drew back. Power politics from that point on to the Bosnian crisis of 1908 were removed from Europe and played out in Africa and Asia. When conflicting interests in Africa threatened to destroy European peace, the European powers had no choice but to carve up Africa in order to preserve the European diplomatic balance that had stabilized itself by the 1880s.
* **Back-to-Africa movements**: A black rabbi, Arnold Ford, from Barbados (via New York) emigrated to Ethiopia in 1930 and entertained in the Tambourine Club with Negro spirituals before it was 'closed down by the government for discriminating against local Ethiopian clients'.$^{9}$ While in Harlem, Ford became attracted to Garvey's message. It seems, therefore, that although the UNIA depu› tation failed to establish organizational links with the Horn of Africa as with Liberia, it did succeed in orienting a number of prospective American black emigrants towards service there. Possibly more individual Garveyites emigrated to Ethiopia than to Liberia. For despite its greater inaccessi› bility, Ethiopia's antiquity and grandeur might have 'exercised a stronger pull than the bourgeois' - and to Garvey's mind - 'anti-African politics of the Americo-Liberian ruling elite'.$^{10}$ Thus, when Garvey broke openly with the Liberian government, evidently many of his adherents looked fondly toward this new horizon.
* **The European exodus**: From the African point of view, perhaps even more remarkable than the apparent exodus of Europeans was the spectacle of white people fighting each other, a thing they had never done during the colonial occupation. What is more they encouraged their subjects in uniform to kill the 'enemy' white man, who hitherto had belonged to a clan who, by virtue of trie colour of his skin, was held to be sacrosanct and desecration of whose person had hitherto been visited with the direst retribution. 23
* **Egypt > Egyptian initiatives and reaction to British conquest 1882-1914**: and wrote articles and pamphlets. ' $^{1}$ These activities aroused a great deal of interest in Europe, but that was as far as it went. KämiPs optimistic belief that Europe in general, and France in particular, would support the Egyptian cause was wholly unjustified. Since France had her own colonies in North Africa, it is not surprising that she was not won over by KämiPs arguments in favour of self-rule. Nor was she ready to go to war with England over Egypt, as the Fashoda incident had shown in 1898.
* **The African challenge to European authority**: The desire to return to a life independent of white rule, that is a return to the status quo ante, comes out clearly in the revolts of the Borgawa and Ohori-Ije in French Dahomey and of various Igbo groups in Owerri province of Nigeria.$^{32}$ To a greater or lesser extent the desire to get rid of the white overlord runs through the majority of revolts against French authority in West Africa. Certainly one of the exacerbating factors in the rising of the Egba in 1918 in Southern Nigeria was the very recent loss of their semi-independent status at the outbreak of the war. In Egypt, the Wafd riots which took place immediately after the war were largely inspired by a desire to shake off the recently imposed British protectorate, which, in its short wartime life of four years, had proved itself excessively ob› noxious to nationalists and fallähtn alike. In Madagascar 500 Malagasy, mainly intellectuals, were arrested at the end of 1915 and accused of 'forming a well-organised secret society with the aim of expelling the French and restoring a Malagasy government'. 33 A major concern of the Allied powers during the war was that Turkey's entry on the German side might encourage dissidence among their Muslim subjects. While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam. The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians. The British in Northern Nigeria, which was predominantly Muslim, were very sensitive to the possible impact of Islamic propaganda there, but the community of interest established between the Sultan and emirs of the Sokoto Caliphate and the British ensured the loyalty of the bulk of Northern Nigerian Muslims.
* **Stages of resistance > The failure of African initiatives and resistance**: Ghäfir in February and March 1933. The latter group refused to compromise; when defeated they moved on until they were hemmed in in mountain or desert retreats and subjected to a barrage of fire. How are we to understand such dogged tenaciousness when in complete isolation?
* **Islam and colonial rule**: But Muslims also opposed colonial rule on both religious and political grounds, and although colonial administrations, such as the French, succeeded in gaining a measure of Muslim support in their West African territories, there were large numbers of Muslims who were bent on preserving the purity of Islam and who could therefore not tolerate submission to a Christian infidel administration, and they sought to rid their countries of French colonialism. Such a desire led to the resurgence of Mahdism which was to end the rule of the unbeliever. The Mahdï, the equivalent of the Christian Messiah, was believed to be the one who would come into the world to establish a just government in accordance with Islamic dogma and finally rid society of the rule of unbelievers. Mahdism reared its head in many parts of the Sudanic zone of West Africa as an expression of anti-French sentiment in Upper Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal, especially from 1906 to the First World War.
Other Islamic movements which expressed an anti-French or anticolonial posture were the Hamalliyya movement, founded by Shaykh Hamallah, which was active in Senegal, French Soudan, Mauritania and Niger and the Sanüsiyya brotherhood, founded by Muhammad b. 'All al-Sanßsï in Libya which became the force which led the Libyans against Italian colonialism. Between i860 and 1901 the Sanüsiyya spread to Tunisia, Egypt, the central Sahara, central Sudan and Senegal.
* **Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?**: European powers were able to conquer Africa with such relative ease because in virtually every respect the dice was so heavily loaded in their favour. In the first place, thanks to the activities of European explorers and missionaries, Europeans were by 1880 far more knowledgeable about Africa and its interior - its physical appearance, terrain, economy and other resources and the strength and weakness of its states and societies - than Africans were about Europe.
Secondly, owing to the revolutionary changes in medical technology and in particular the discovery of the prophylactic use of quinine against malaria, Europeans became far less fearful of Africa than they had been before the middle of the nineteenth century. 57 Thirdly, as a result of the uneven nature of the trade between Europe and Africa up to the 1870s, and even after, as well as the increasing pace of the industrial revolution, the material and financial resources available to Europe were overwhelming in comparison with those of Africa. Thus while . European powers could afford to spend millions of pounds on overseas campaigns, African states were unable to sustain any protracted military confrontation against them.
* **The Maghrib states and the Europeans**: By 1914 resistance organized by a centralized indigenous political authority had come to an end except in Libya. But the situation created by the First World War prevented the colonial powers from moving on to the phase of effective occupation. French, Spaniards and Italians sought only to maintain what they had already gained. But they suffered serious reverses; and this led General Lyautey, the French Resident in Morocco, to remark that: 'He who does not advance retreats'. The Germans and Turks called on the people of North Africa to throw off the colonial yoke; pan-Islamic leaders such as the Tunisian Bach Hamba and the Moroccan al-Attâbï were received in Berlin, and took part in propaganda tours in neutral countries; emissaries were sent into the Rïf and to the Wâdï Nun area; and arms were shipped to the Tripolitanian resistance fighters through the port of Misuräta. There is no doubt that some of the people believed that the colonizers could be driven back into the sea. The fragility of the occupation in the territories conquered immediately before the war is shown by the extreme nervousness of the proconsuls of this period and the 'liberalism' they had to parade. Lyautey went so far as to behave like a mere minister of foreign affairs to the Sultan of Morocco.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > National prestige**: The greatest exponent of this theory is Carlton Hayes. In a perceptive passage he contends: France sought compensation for European loss in overseas gain. England would offset her European isolation by enlarging and glorify› ing the British empire. Russia, halted in the Balkans, would turn anew to Asia, and Germany and Italy would show the world that the prestige they had won by might inside Europe they were entitled to enhance by imperial exploits outside. The lesser powers, with no great prestige at stake, managed to get on without any new imperialism, though Portugal and Holland displayed a revived pride in the empires they already possessed and the latter's was administered with renewed vigor. 1S Hayes concludes therefore that 'the new imperialism' was basically 'a nationalistic phenomenon' and that its proponents hankered after national prestige. European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'. Thus, he concludes, the partition of Africa was not an economic phenomenon. 1 6
* **The ideology of resistance**: That Ajayi and Rodney can see the decisive importance of the loss of sovereignty is far from demonstrating, of course, that African resisters conceived of sovereignty in this way. Rodney himself deplores the 'partial and inadequate view of the world' which prevented African leaders from fully understanding what was at stake in the encounter with Europe. Ajayi asserts, however, that the rulers of African states 'as guardians of the sovereignty of the people' were 'hostile to whatever powers challenged this sovereignty'.$^{9}$ And historians have recovered some striking explicit state› ments of sovereignty.
* **The ideology of resistance**: Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance. They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6
Over the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.
The chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ... Overnight, African political states lost their power, independence and meaning. 8
* **The African challenge to European authority**: At a time when the Allied colonial regimes in Africa could least afford trouble in their own backyards, their authority - still only tenuously established in places like southern Ivory Coast, much of Libya, or Karamoja in Uganda - was widely challenged by armed risings and other forms of protest by their subjects. As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.
* **The legacy of wars**: In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans. African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.
They continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.
It appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.
* ****: Most of this research of the last two decades has been sober, detailed, scholarly, not avoiding the ambiguities of many of the resistances. But most of it has been based upon, or used to demonstrate, three dogmatic assumptions, which I believe still to be essentially true, even though each has been modified by recent research and analysis. It has been argued, first, that the fact of African resistance is significant because it proves that Africans did not acquiesce placidly in a European 'pacification'. It has been argued, secondly, that this resistance was neither despairing nor irrational, but that it was often powered by rational and innovative ideologies. It has been argued, thirdly, that these resistances were not futile; that they had significant consequences in their time and still have significant resonances today. These three arguments are worth restating here, together with the modifications proposed to them.

## Economic success and the resulting envy and hatred towards Jews in Europe could have been a catalyst for increased anti-Semitic sentiments, potentially leading to their migration to Palestine.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary perspectives on the claim that economic success and resulting envy and hatred towards Jews in Europe could have been a catalyst for increased anti-Semitic sentiments, potentially leading to their migration to Palestine. The General History of Africa notes the presence of a Jewish minority in the Maghrib region during the nineteenth century, who were involved in economic activities and acted as intermediaries within the European capitalist network, suggesting a privileged status that could potentially lead to envy or resentment. However, it does not explicitly link this to anti-Semitic sentiments or migration to Palestine. In contrast, The African Times articles discuss the economic success of Jews in Europe, describing them as "notorious for wealth" and "monopolists in many profitable things," which could incite envy, hatred, and persecution. This aligns with the claim that economic success could catalyze increased anti-Semitic sentiments. The articles also imply that such sentiments might force Jews to migrate, as indicated by the statement, "We shall never go out unless you turn us out!" While this supports the idea of migration due to economic success and resulting persecution, the articles do not explicitly state that this migration would be specifically to Palestine, only alluding to a prophesied return to Judea. Thus, both sources highlight a connection between economic success and potential persecution, but neither directly links this to migration to Palestine.

* **Beneficiaries of the crisis**: As elsewhere, the situation that prevailed in the Maghrtib in the nineteenth century produced its breed of profiteers. First of all, there were the European settlers, whose numerical strength stood at 164000 in 1855, 245 000 in 1872 and 375 000 in 1882 in Algeria.$^{44}$ In Tunisia, they numbered about 11000 in 1856, 14000 in 1870 and 19000 in 1881.$^{45}$ In Libya, the figures remained fairly low until the early years of the twentieth century. Although most of the Europeans in Algeria and Tunisia were of humble origin, they enjoyed, nonetheless, a very privileged status by comparison with the majority of local people. The same was true of a Jewish minority, which succeeded in playing a role, in some capacity or another, within the European capitalist network and took advantage of their position as intermediaries between these networks and the indigenous population.$^{46}$ There were some, though fewer, Muslims who succeeded in playing a similar role: those who became consular agents, brokers and, more frequently, business associates of European trading concerns who sought at the earliest opportunity to escape from the control of the Muslim authorities so as to benefit from the protection of the European consuls in Tunisia, Libya and Morocco.$^{47}$ Much better known were the high-ranking servants of the Makhzen, who misused their positions in order to build up huge fortunes thanks to the confusion prevailing in their troubled countries: for example, Mustafa Khaznadar, the Tunisian prime minister from 1837 to 1873, accumulated a sum amounting, at a conserva› tive estimate, to some 25 million francs, the greater part of which was invested in France. 48 The colonial officials in Algeria and the weakened authority of the bey in Tunisia had to rely, in rural areas, on certain influential persons who exercised a kind of 'feudal' power over the communities within their jurisdiction, for example Mukrânï in Algeria, until he rebelled and died in 1871,$^{49}$ and 'All bin Khalifa in south-eastern Tunisia from 1840 to 1881, before he decided irTthat year to head the resistance movement against France which subsequently led to his exile in Libya.$^{50}$ The same kind of trend seems to explain the rise of a number of religious families who monopolized, from generation to generation, the

## The rise of nationalism and the desire to build a "glorious nation" among Jews could have been a significant motivator for the Zionist movement.

The General History of Africa textbook does not directly address the rise of nationalism among Jews or the Zionist movement, focusing instead on various nationalist movements in Africa and the Middle East influenced by colonialism, economic factors, and religious elements. This absence of information on Jewish nationalism and Zionism means the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim that the desire to build a "glorious nation" was a significant motivator for the Zionist movement. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide relevant insights, discussing the notion that Jews might eventually return to Judea and Syria to establish a great nation as an appointed destiny. However, the articles highlight a lack of enthusiasm among Jews for this idea, with some expressing contentment with their current situation in Europe and skepticism about leaving unless forced out. This sentiment contrasts with the claim, suggesting that the desire to build a nation was not a universally motivating factor at the time. Instead, the articles imply that external pressures, such as persecution and envy due to wealth, might be more significant motivators for any potential movement towards establishing a nation. Thus, while acknowledging the potential for a nationalistic movement, the articles emphasize external factors over an inherent desire to build a "glorious nation" as the primary motivator.

* **Conclusion**: However, ideas concerning the self-determination of peoples and the accountability of colonial powers had been sown during this war. These ideas were to influence profoundly the development of the incipient nationalist movements during the ensuing period of peace. But it was to take a second world war to provide the cataclysm which translated the requests of the nationalists for greater participation in the process of government, into demands for full control of it.
* **After the First World War: an upsurge of nationalism and colonialist reaction > The constitutional quarrel in Tunisia**: During the second part of the nineteenth century, Tunisia had experienced a reformist upsurge which was in some respects in advance of similar movements in Egypt and Turkey. ' ° The failure of these attempts had not lessened their appeal for the enlightened bourgeoisie, which was inclined to look to the East rather than to the West for its models. Ottoman nostalgia was now replaced by hope in the principles enunciated by Woodrow Wilson, and nationalism, as in the case of the Egyptian Wafd Party, changed its tune. Shaykh 'Abd al-'Azïz al-Tha'âlibï (Taalbi) and his friends decided to plead their cause before public opinion in metropolitan France, especially the socialist sector. Their pamphlet, La Tunisie martyre (The Martyrdom of Tunisia) (1920), presented a vigorous analysis of colonial deterioration. By founding the 'constitutionalist' or Destürian party (Feb› ruary 1920) they intended to restore Tunisia to her independent existence.
* **The socio-political consequences of the War**: the founder of the Algerian nationalist move› ment.$^{73}$ In Tunisia a delegation of thirty men representative of the Arab community called on the Bey to initiate political reform, reminding him of the sacrifices Tunisia had made in the war.$^{74}$ Certainly much of the impetus behind the foundation of the Destiir or Constitution Party in 1920 came from returned soldiers and labourers who were dissatisfied with their subordinate position in their own country.$^{75}$ In British West Africa, the press, while generally extremely loyal to the British and critical of the Germans, believed that the reward for this loyalty would be a more significant role for the educated elite in the colonial decision-making process. 76 The war acted not only as a stimulus to African nationalism but also to white nationalism, particularly in South Africa. There, though the Afrikaner rebellion was speedily put down, the spirit which informed it was not. As William Henry Vatcher has put it: The rebellion reconfirmed what the Boer War had taught, that force was not the answer, that battle must be pitched in the political arena. Thus, in a real sense, modern Afrikaner nationalism, conceived in the Boer War, was born in the 1914 rebellion. If the first world war had not taken place, the Boers might have been better able to adjust to the conciliatory policy of Botha and Smuts. The war forced on them the decision to organize, first covertly in the form of the Afrikaner Broederbond, then in the form of the 'purified' National Party. 77 In Kenya, the white settlers used the war to make major political advances vis-à-vis the colonial government. They secured the right of whites to elect representatives to the Legislative Council, where after 1918 they formed a majority. This, coupled with the Crown Lands Ordinance, which made racial segregation in the White Highlands possible, the Native Registration Ordinance, which introduced a pseudo-pass law for Africans, and the Soldier Settlement Scheme which allocated large portions of the Nandi reserve for settlement of white soldiers after the war, entrenched the white minority in a dominant position in Kenya up to the 1950s. 78 A major stimulus to Kenya nationalism was the reaction against such privileges gained by the white community, in particular with regard to land. Thus the Kikuyu Association, consisting mainly of chiefs, was founded in 1920 to defend Kikuyu land interests while Harry Thuku's Young
* **The economic and political setting in Southern Africa and the Belgian Congo: an overview > Popular protest, nationalism and politics in South Africa and the surrounding territories**: The ideology of these churches had much in common. There was, in the first place, the idea that, in the true teaching of Christ, blacks are equal in everything, and that the European missionaries were distorting the Bible. Messianism was a feature of Afro-Christian churches, with their belief in the second advent of the Saviour - this time a black one. The second advent, the adherents of these churches and sects believed, would usher in a thousand-year rule of good and justice, while colonialists would be driven out of Africa. ' 3 Independent churches, both of the Zionist and Ethiopian varieties, were particularly widespread in South Africa and represented an important form of dissent. Their numbers spread rapidly. In 1918 there were seventy-six; by 1932 the number had increased to 320; and a decade later there were more than 800.$^{14}$ From the standpoint of social movements, the separatist Ethiopian churches, with their elected officials, flags, charters and para› military organizations, represented the assertion, within the framework of the Church, of the claim for African self-government. Similarly, the Zionist churches were often led by charismatic anti-European prophets who held out an apocalyptic vision and the hope of a reconstructed society free of oppression and white rule. ' 5 Despite close state surveillance, independent churches periodically engaged in explicit insurgent activities. As early as 1884 Nehemiah Tile, a Methodist preacher, had urged his adherents in Tembuland to disregard state officials.$^{16}$ In 1921 an Ethiopian sect known as the Israelites under the leadership of Enoch Mgijima forcibly resisted removal from a squatter settlement in Queenstown. The Israelites contended that the New Testa› ment, a fiction of the white man's, must be disregarded and that if they worshipped the ancient Hebraic forms, Jehovah would ultimately liberate them from the yoke of oppression. Even as a large police and military force approached, the Israelites, armed only with swords and spears, remained defiant. 'Jehovah tells us that we are not to allow you to burn our huts, or drive away our people from Ntabelanga, or allow you to arrest the men you wish to arrest."$^{7}$ The soldiers, armed with machine guns, killed 163 Israelites and wounded 129.
* **The prevailing system and mounting opposition > Islamic reformism**: As has been said, the book has the device of the 'Ulama' on the flyleaf. Nowadays, emphasis is rightly put on the national aims of this association as well as on its religious objectives. The programme of Shaykh 'Abd al-Hamïd ben Bâdïs,$^{42}$ though it is aimed at being free of circumstantial implications, was perhaps really more political than the other projects then in the forefront, compromised as these were by administrative manoeuvres at the bottom and by political intrigue at the top. The most spectacular attempts were far from being the most effective: for example, Dr BendjellüPs venture at Constantine, or the egalitarian claims of the 'Elus'.$^{43}$ The Shaykh, while taking care not to defy French sovereignty, insisted on an 'intellectual and moral reform', and in so doing raised the question of identity, touched on the impulses of the majority, and echoed similar movements in the Middle East. He thus appealed to a model which compared well with that of western democracy. Above all he addressed himself to clearly existing signs of social dispersion and moral deterioration. Claiming Algeria as his homeland or watan (but not openly as a 'state' or dawla), Islam as his religion, and Arabic as his language, he combined tactical subtlety with foreknowledge of the role that culture could play in decolonization.
Another, less well-known aspect is the geographical one. As the nasabs (lines of descent) show, the leadership of the movement included several provincial names: not only those of the Constantine aristocracy, like Ben Bâdïs, but also TØbessa, Mïla and Sïdï 'Okba.$^{44}$ Not content with having established the 'Circle for Progress' over the central plateau, especially Algiers and other urban areas, the movement also aimed at covering 'the unknown country'. Shaykh Bashïr al-Ibrâhïmï stirred Tlemcen to its depths, and attempts of this kind grew more and more numerous, in the form of sermons, and the activities of friendly societies and mutual benefit associations.
* **Introduction**: Two forms of nationalism competed for supremacy in North-East Africa in the inter-war years - secular nationalism on the one side and religiouslyinspired patriotism on the other. The continuing legacy of the Mahdï in the Sudan and of Sayyid Muhammad in Somalia managed to fuse religion and patriotic sentiment the most directly. On the other hand, Egyptian nationalism in the inter-war years was getting more secular (see Fig. 4.1). But even in Egypt, Islamic modernism and nationalism interacted in the theatre of politics. After all, Sa'd Zaghlül, the nationalist who dominated Egyptian politics for the first decade following the First World War, was influenced by Djamäl al-Dïn al-Afghânï, the stormy revolutionary panIslamist who had had a part in 'bringing about the first stirrings of national consciousness and discontent under IsmäTT.$^{1}$ However, it would still be true to say that the movement which Zaghlül led was basically a secular patriotic movement. The protests in southern Sudan were also basically secular: it was in northern Sudan and Somalia during those inter-war years that the religious factor was the more difficult to disentangle from the political.
In addition to the dialectic between religion and secularism in politics during these years, there was the dialectic between nationalism and economic problems. This period included some of the worst years of economic depression in the history of the modern world. By the end of the 1920s the imperial powers themselves were experiencing the pressures of a deepening recession, culminating in the Great Depression. The colonies of North-East Africa had been feeling the economic squeeze a decade or two before the Great Depression hit the industrialized world.
For North-East Africa yet another characteristic of the inter-war years was that they witnessed both a further expansion of imperialism, on one side, and a new militancy against imperialism on the other. The years between the two world wars were the years of Europe's last frontier - as new territory was annexed and colonial control was consolidated. This was imperialism's last territorial push in Africa. But the same years also witnessed the rise of anti-colonial militancy among the colonized peoples and the beginnings of effective political organization in pursuit of freedom and equality. In North-East Africa this was particularly marked in Egypt - but by no means exclusively there.
* **Egypt > Egyptian initiatives and reaction to British conquest 1882-1914**: In 1893 the Egyptian nationalist movement began to emerge from this quiescent phase when certain Egyptian elements started to criticize and resist the British occupation of Egypt. First among them was the ambitious new Khedive 'Abbas Hilmï ('Abbâs II, 1892-1914), who encouraged the development of a nationalist movement demanding the immediate evacu› ation of the British. His financial assistance to the press, which enabled the movement to become articulate, was of particular importance. During the first three years of his reign, 'Abbas placed himself at the forefront of this movement and he became a very real challenge to the autocratic rule of Lord Cromer, the British Agent and Consul-General, and succeeded in forcing the pro-British prime minister to resign on 15 January 1893. Although he was unable after that to act so openly owing to pressure from the British, Hilmï nevertheless attracted some dedicated recruits who were willing to carry on the struggle against the British occupation. They were a group of young intellectuals, who were familiar with the ideas of the French revolution and with modern social and political theories.$^{9}$ The old Egyptian society with its strict code and religious restrictions was, in fact, gradually breaking up, a development that led to considerable instability. The educated Egyptians were particularly alarmed by the British domin› ation of the civil service, the only area of advancement that remained open to them. By 1905, 42% of the higher posts were occupied by the British, 30% by Armenians and Syrians, and only 28% by Egyptians. $^{l}$ ° The most vehement opponents of British rule at that time were Mustafa Kâmil, a charismatic leader and eloquent orator, and his Nationalist Party. Kâmil had at first concentrated his efforts on winning European support for the cause of Egypt's independence. He had apparently felt that other European states were so jealous of the British occupation of Egypt that they would actively support any attempts to remove them. With generous funds supplied by the Khedive, Kâmil toured European capitals during the period 1895-8 where he addressed meetings, gave interviews to news› papers, and wrote articles and pamphlets. ' $^{1}$ These activities aroused a great deal of interest in Europe, but that was as far as it went. KämiPs optimistic belief that Europe in general, and France in particular, would
* **The Sudan > Young protest movements**: Inspired by the example of the Wafd, Sudanese nationalists concept16. For the official translation of this telegram see H. Abdin, 1970, pp. 48-9. 17. ibid., p. 4. ualized and articulated local grievances into an ideology of opposition to alien rule. They did not, however, formulate their opposition in religious terms, but dwelled upon the economic and political grievances, always emphasizing the greed and foreignness of the colonizer. The 'Demands of the Nation' which 'Abd-al-Latïf wrote for al-Hadära in 1922 was devoted entirely to criticism of the government.
The main technique used by the nationalists for the dissemination of their ideas and propaganda on a mass level was at first hand-outs. Leaflets were mailed to different addresses in the country. In November 1920 a 'Faithful Advisor' sent to hundreds of addresses copies of a famous circular letter in which he attacked British policy of 'divide and rule' in Egypt and the Sudan, and called upon the two nations to unite against British colonialism.$^{18}$ Leaflets were sometimes posted in public places and scattered on the streets. Moreover, the nationalists occasionally smuggled some material for publication in the sympathetic Egyptian press and organized plays and literary festivals.
By 1923, however, the nationalists had abandoned these ineffective clandestine methods of propaganda for more revolutionary tactics. They felt that open confrontation with the British colonial regime was the best way to broaden the nationalist base and mobilize popular support for its ideals. In this militancy, the nationalists were apparently consciously emulating the example of the Wafd in Egypt. '$^{9}$ Like their counterparts in India, they also appealed over the heads of colonial officials in Khartoum to liberal opinion in Britain to support the Sudan's claim to selfdetermination.
This change in political orientation and tactics produced in 1924 violent political agitation in Khartoum and some provincial capitals and towns. The WFL organized a series of demonstrations and riots in Atbara, Port Sudan, El Obeid and Shendï (see Fig. 4.1), particularly after the arrest of its president,$^{ c}$Abd al-LatTf, and two of his colleagues in July. The secular side of Sudanese nationalism was more pronounced in these riots.
* **Conclusion**: Even if the lot of the subject peoples did not change much for the better in the years following the war, when even willing attempts at reform were aborted by the depression,$^{86}$ searching questions about the morality of colonialism had begun to be asked. And it was in this climate that the nationalist movement gestated that was eventually to obtain independence for many African countries. For example, leaders of the National Congress of British West Africa like J. E. Casely Hayford and H. C. Bankole-Bright were able to gain an international hearing through the League of Nations Union, concerning themselves with the administration of Togoland and appealing to the Covenant of the League as a charter for 'just treatment towards our people'. And at long range, the idea of the Mandate evolved into the post-Second World War concept of Trusteeship, which incorpor› ated the explicit goal of eventual independence for the Trust Territories which were to be visited by 'neutral' missions of inspection.
* **After the First World War: an upsurge of nationalism and colonialist reaction > The first responses of the workers**: The heavy concentration of wage labourers in Tunisia, such as that in the Metlawï mines, for example, showed for a long time little sign of protest. As in Algeria, industrialization was not advanced enough, and the social context was too authoritarian, for the energy of the proletarian masses to manifest itself to begin with other than through a small avant-garde group educated in the ways of European trade unionism.
But in tunisia, the early action of Muhammad 'All$^{2}$ ' and the analysis offered by Tahär al-Haddäd$^{22}$ had some effect on class organization. The adventurous life of the former had brought him into contact with German socialism and made him a friend of Enver Pasha, probably the man with the clearest sense at that time of the ways in which the leading ideas of the West might combine with the nationalist upsurge of the Islamic peoples. Al-Haddäd supplemented the foreign experience of Muhammad 'All with an examination of the domestic problem. He discussed both the subject of the workers and that of women, showing a clear grasp of the nature of each question. The dockers, first of Tunis and then of Bizerta, the cementworkers of Hammam Lïf, and others gave a practical response to Haddäd's dual drive.
* **African nationalism and international developments**: The situations which African nationalists found themselves in the inter-war years were essentially the same: deprivation of political and social liberties; exploitation of human and material resources to the benefit of the alien rulers; denial of facilities and services which could contribute to the political and social upliftment of the colonized societies or, when it became clear that changes could not be prevented, the pursuit of actions aimed at limiting and reorientating the course of development with the main objective of perpetuating colonial dominance.
* **The Sudan > Young protest movements**: The first nationalist movement of the early 1920s was thus not successful and the main reason for its failure was that it lacked popular support. This was mainly because it neither sought nor wished to ally itself with local and religious forces, the two reservoirs of mass following in the country. Nevertheless, it is significant because it emerged earlier than nationalist movements in other tropical African dependencies. Moreover, its ideological components survived the decade of political apathy. For its most important political slogan - the Unity of the Nile Valley - was picked up by the Ashika and other Unionist parties in the 1940s.
* **African nationalism and international developments**: As a counter-current to all these forces which were working for the upliftment of the social and political status of colonized or oppressed groups, there was the spread and influence of illiberal and retrogressively racialist political doctrines which became institutionalized in fascist and Nazi regimes in Europe and in repressive autocracies in the colonies, especially the Italian ones. Even in European countries, like France, where liberal political doctrines prevailed, fascism and Nazism found adherents and this fact reflected on the thinking over the situation in the colonies.
In general, industrial and commercial capitalists in Europe continued to see colonies as estates to be preserved at all costs.
* **Egypt > Egyptian initiatives and reaction to British conquest 1882-1914**: The most urgent task facing the young nationalists was to disprove Cromer's biased claim that the Egyptians were incapable of ruling them› selves on civilized principles, and to convince the Egyptians themselves that they formed a nation capable and indeed deserving of self-rule. Kâmil was preoccupied with this task from 1898 onwards. Until 1906 his views were expressed in numerous speeches and articles in the newspapers of the day, particularly in al-Liwä (The Flag) which he founded in 1900. He stressed Egypt's past to combat defeatism and to show that the Egyptians were capable of great things. 'Had I not been born an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one', and 'there is no sense in life when it is coupled with despair, and no sense in despair as long as there is life'$^{12}$ - such were the slogans he devised. Kämil's speeches and articles aimed to break down local rivalries and unite all the population in a nationalist front, and to develop national education in order to strengthen patriotic sentiment. His political activities began to bear fruit as he was able to organize a strike of law students in February 1906.
* **The Sudan > Mahdist resistance to colonial rule > Neo-Mahdism**: Since 1914, Sayyid 'Abd al-Rahmän, the posthumous son of the Mahdï, had felt that fanaticism would no longer work and that the interests of both the Sudanese nation and the Mahdist sect would best be served by co-operating with the British on the motto of the Sudan for the Sudanese. This constitutionalism did not really ring true, but was, in fact, dictated by political realities. For al-Sayyid clearly realized that an armed rising could only lead to total destruction.
Similarly al-Sayyid was shrewd enough to realize that political and religious agitation required financial backing. Consequently, he enlarged his agricultural and commercial enterprises until he had become a large landowner and a wealthy capitalist by 1935. Rather than giving a nonpolitical outlet to his ambitions as the colonial officials had naively expected, 'Abd al-Rahmän used this wealth to strengthen the Ansär organization.
Through adroit manoeuvres and obstinate contest, he shrewdly by-passed colonial restrictions, consolidated his influence in traditional Mahdist centres in the west, and attracted fresh adherents and founded new spheres of influence. Seeing that political nationalism was beginning to supersede religion as the principal motive power in the east, al-Sayyid made special efforts in the 1930s to gain the support of the educated class. 25 By 1935 neo-Mahdism had thus become an important anti-colonial political force. The potential unity that it achieved between a sizeable section of the intelligentsia and the traditional and religious elements became the nucleus for the Independence Front that had an overwhelming nationalist appeal in the 1950s. This Front played an important and unique role in achieving the independence of the nation in 1956.
* **The Sudan > Young protest movements**: The Sudanese nationalist movement of the early 1920s has been dismissed by many British writers as unrepresentative and its proponents as mere agents and pawns of Egypt. But recent studies by Sudanese scholars have demonstrated that though tactically, culturally and ideologic› ally closely connected with Egypt, this movement was indigenous and mainly concerned with the repudiation of British colonial rule. The programmes of both the LSU and WFL stressed and gave precedence to liberation from 'the slavery of the colonial master'. The originality of this movement is better seen in a telegram that 'Alï 'Abd al-Latïf and three of his colleagues sent to the governor-general on 15 May 1924. This important document spoke explicitly of a Sudanese nation and a right to selfdetermination, brushing aside British and Egyptian claims to decide, alone, the future of the Sudan. ' 6 The call for unity with Egypt that the nationalists advocated was apparently more of a political slogan than a tenet of nationalist faith. It was largely an expedient calculated to gain the sympathy and support of Egypt, which was undergoing a national struggle herself. Moreover, this slogan of unity seems to have been forced on the nationalists by the refusal of Britain to concede the right of self-determination, and her policy of using local and religious leaders to perpetuate her rule. From this point, 'the idea of unity was the most, if not the only, leeway and counter-strategy for the nationalists'.$^{17}$ Once Britain, the common enemy, was expelled from the Sudan, the nationalists expected that Egypt could be persuaded to leave. The motto of 'The Sudan for the Sudanese' raised by the traditional and conservative leadership was dismissed by the educated as a British-inspired plot to exclude Egypt and dominate the Sudan.
* **The prevailing system and mounting opposition > Islamic reformism**: The resulting proliferation of centres of the movement is often recorded only in terms of theological controversies which are almost incompre› hensible to outsiders. But all these stirrings, whether under the aegis of the Ulemas or of some rival such as Shaykh Ben 'Alïwa at Mostagänem, 45 or arising out of ineradicable differences, as at Le Mzâb,$^{46}$ represented the first contact with a worldwide problem for communities which up till then had been quite cut off, and which the administration had been unable to arouse except perhaps against themselves. Shaykh Ben Bâdïs and his friends set an example by giving North African Islam a doctrinal shake-up which had not been attempted for centuries: their commentaries on the Ku'ran, for example, were a cultural exploit if ever there was one.$^{47}$ They were even so bold as to distinguish between transcendental invariables and circumstantial variables in religion.$^{48}$ Detailed monographs are needed to study the relationships between the most important tendencies and the various social factors involved, and to distinguish the roles played by different social and age groups, economic strata, individuals, and moral attitudes. Such studies would without doubt reveal that the period was a turning-point in the social history of Algeria.
* **The expression of African nationalism and politics**: It is in this context that one should seek to understand the role of traditionalist or 'nativistic' socio-religious movements in our period. Of particular relevance as we have seen already in some of the earlier chapters were the messianic movements which expressed indigenous ideologies as well as those which reflected Islamic and Christian ones. They were movements which were emancipatory in character, expressing what is essentially a universal phenomenon in situations in which communities had to express their dissatisfaction with their living conditions and a desire for regeneration. They represented an ideology competing against colonial› ism in so far as the latter represented a negation of indigenous culture and economic, social and psychological depression of the colonized. In the words of Lanternari, 'They reflect the anxieties and hopes of the groups that participate in them for a sudden and total transformation of their physical, social and psychological environment.' 16 Prominent examples of such movements in our period, some of whose activities have been discussed in Chapter 20 above, were Ethiopianism in South and East Africa, and the movement spearheaded by millenarian preachers in Southern and Central Africa, notably the Kitawala (African and Congo Watch Tower) with large following in the Rhodesias, spreading to the Congo (now Zaire) and Nyasaland (now Malawi); the Kimbanguist movement (founded in the Belgian Congo by Simon Kimbangu) with following in Belgian and French Congo and the neo-Kimbanguist Mission des Noirs founded in the Lower Congo by Simon-Pierre Mpadi. Otherwise known as the Khakists, the movement had influence among the population of French Congo and Oubangui-Chari (now Central African Republic). Some of these movements were inspired by their acceptance of Christianity but were disenchanted with the expression of the religion in the organized Church of the colonial societies. African nationalists who were anxious to preserve Africans against colonial oppression found the Church at best indifferent. They therefore broke away very much in the spirit of the Reformation which has been characteristic of the growth and spread of Christianity in many societies. Like the reformation movements in Europe and elsewhere, the churches and movements founded by African National› ists aimed at applying Christian ideologies like the ideas of the brotherhood of man and the essential oneness of believers, without distinction as to race or colour, to end discrimination and oppression.
* **African nationalism and international developments**: Kenyatta (Kenya); as well as J. T. Gumede and I. A. La Guma (South Africa). Also represented were members of the Inter-Colonial Union like Max Bloncoux, while Carlos Deambrosis Martins came from Haiti. 12 There were also movements concerned with protecting the rights of man and citizenship and anti-slavery bodies which operated both in Europe and in several colonies in Africa. Movements which originated from America like Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association first launched in 1917 exerted influence in several colonies in Africa.
* **The impact of Egypt: The 'other side of the river'**: Before making a final assessment, we must first of all answer one funda› mental question: what is the explanation for this renaissance at a time of crisis; and then, the blotting out of what for the period was a dazzling breakthrough, the cutting short of a process that is still remembered with regret by the Arab world and by Africa?
First and foremost, there was the crushing weight of geopolitical factors from the beginning to the end of the entire process, which proved more powerful than that of internal factors, which also had a fundamental role to play. If we represent the matrix of 'social dialectics' by two circles, an external, exogenous, circle, and an internal, endogenous, circle, it seems that for Egypt, that tortured country which was the meeting place of the Orient and the West, and of the three continents of Africa, Asia and Europe, the external circle, the circle of geopolitics, did control the whole process.
Moreover, the blows dealt to the first phase of the Egyptian renaissance from the great naval battles in the Mediterranean and the Treaty of London of 1840 to the military occupation of 1882, the massive influx of capital and foreign settlers, the gradual dismantling of the independence and nation-building movement, left Egypt little time - and this brings us to the heart of the endogenous circle of 'social dialectics' - to develop a coherent system of national thought that could withstand foreign pen› etration; and, at the same time, to give the nation's overall policy a realistic and appropriate structure. The main thrusts of Egyptian thought, liberal modernism on the one hand and Islamic fundamentalism on the other, did not endeavour to join forces until the mid-twentieth century. The nine› teenth century was one of projects, of unsatisfactory compromises, of impossible mergers. Hence the nation's permeability, for the modernism derived from acculturation was easily confused with a well thought-out national modernity, and the 'Western wave' could easily isolate the different constituent factors and the principal formations of the Egyptian national movement.

country can be so favourable to the settlement of these poor people?" But the fact soon transpired that the wealthy Jews of Europe had subscribed funds for the purchase of lands in the United States of America for them, and for the expenses of their conveyance to and settlement there. A spontaneous movement, therefore, of any considerable body of Jews toward Palestine was not to be looked for. Again, therefore, the question is forced upon us, since, according to our reading of prophecy, go there they must and will,—again, we say, the question is forced upon us, "What is to be the determining cause of their return?" Is it surprising that the little cloud no bigger than a man's hand in Berlin should powerfully impress our mind? It is an event so unexpected, so improbable, seemingly so impossible, at this advanced period of the nineteenth century; a social persecution on the ground of difference of race and creed seems so opposed to the enlightened humanitarianism of the age! so nationally disgraceful and injurious! Yet there it is; a fact beyond dispute. Is it a mere passing cloud, or is it the herald of coming storm and tempest? Will the persecution be confined to the comparatively few persons who have originated it, or will it spread among the more ignorant multitude, and become a national demonstration? And if a national demonstration in Germany, will it spread elsewhere? A few words spoken some years ago are recalled by our memory. We were speaking with a Jewish friend of the great future destinies of his race in Judea. It woke no enthusiasm; the idea was evidently a distasteful rather than a cherished one, and I heard the words, "Where can we be better off than here? [meaning England, France, and Germany.] We shall never go out unless you turn us out!" I replied, "That seems impossible. But you are becoming notorious for wealth; you are becoming monopolists in many profitable things; this may beget envy, and envy hatred, and hatred persecution, since the multitude is everywhere easily moved to evil. But my opinion is that a change will be wrought in your own feelings as a people, and that an intense desire to build up a glorious nation will carry you all back." That the seed of Jacob will become a great nation—the greatest among the nations—in Judea and Syria, we know; it is so appointed; and according to all human appearances and reason, the time is drawing nigh. But beyond this we know nothing, and can only watch the signs of the times for indications as to the impulses under which the return to Judea to build up the nation shall be accomplished.
