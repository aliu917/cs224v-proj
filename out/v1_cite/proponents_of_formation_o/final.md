The General History of Africa textbook does not address the persecution of Jews in Europe during the late 19th century or its influence on the movement towards establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, focusing instead on various historical events and movements in Africa, such as nationalist movements, colonial resistance, and religious influences. This absence of information highlights a notable gap in the textbook's coverage of this significant historical development. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide relevant insights into the claim by discussing the social persecution of Jews in Europe, particularly in Berlin, based on race and creed. This persecution is portrayed as unexpected and contrary to the humanitarian ideals of the time, potentially serving as a catalyst for a larger movement towards establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. The articles suggest that external pressures, such as persecution, might influence Jews to consider returning to Judea to build a nation. Additionally, they introduce the idea that internal motivations, such as a change in the Jewish people's own feelings and a desire to establish a glorious nation, could also drive the movement, adding complexity to the claim by suggesting both external and internal factors at play.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting insights regarding the claim about the initial popularity of the idea of Jews returning to Palestine among European Jews. The General History of Africa does not provide any information directly related to this claim, as its focus is on colonialism, resistance, and socio-political dynamics in Africa, without addressing Jewish sentiments or movements concerning Palestine. In contrast, The African Times articles offer relevant information supporting the claim. They highlight that a spontaneous movement of Jews toward Palestine was not anticipated, as European Jews felt secure and prosperous in countries like England, France, and Germany. A conversation with a Jewish friend is mentioned, where the friend expressed a lack of enthusiasm for returning to Judea, asking, "Where can we be better off than here?" This sentiment aligns with the claim that European Jews felt secure and prosperous in their current countries. Additionally, the articles suggest that Jews were becoming notable for their wealth and monopolistic tendencies, which could lead to envy and persecution, potentially influencing a change in their feelings towards returning to Palestine. Thus, while the General History of Africa does not address the claim, The African Times provides evidence supporting the notion that the initial idea of returning to Palestine was not popular among European Jews.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary perspectives on the claim that economic success and resulting envy and hatred towards Jews in Europe could have been a catalyst for increased anti-Semitic sentiments, potentially leading to their migration to Palestine. The General History of Africa notes the presence of a Jewish minority in the Maghrib region during the nineteenth century, who were involved in economic activities and acted as intermediaries within the European capitalist network, suggesting a privileged status that could potentially lead to envy or resentment. However, it does not explicitly link this to anti-Semitic sentiments or migration to Palestine. In contrast, The African Times articles discuss the economic success of Jews in Europe, describing them as "notorious for wealth" and "monopolists in many profitable things," which could incite envy, hatred, and persecution. This aligns with the claim that economic success could catalyze increased anti-Semitic sentiments. The articles also imply that such sentiments might force Jews to migrate, as indicated by the statement, "We shall never go out unless you turn us out!" While this supports the idea of migration due to economic success and resulting persecution, the articles do not explicitly state that this migration would be specifically to Palestine, only alluding to a prophesied return to Judea. Thus, both sources highlight a connection between economic success and potential persecution, but neither directly links this to migration to Palestine.

The General History of Africa textbook does not directly address the rise of nationalism among Jews or the Zionist movement, focusing instead on various nationalist movements in Africa and the Middle East influenced by colonialism, economic factors, and religious elements. This absence of information on Jewish nationalism and Zionism means the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim that the desire to build a "glorious nation" was a significant motivator for the Zionist movement. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide relevant insights, discussing the notion that Jews might eventually return to Judea and Syria to establish a great nation as an appointed destiny. However, the articles highlight a lack of enthusiasm among Jews for this idea, with some expressing contentment with their current situation in Europe and skepticism about leaving unless forced out. This sentiment contrasts with the claim, suggesting that the desire to build a nation was not a universally motivating factor at the time. Instead, the articles imply that external pressures, such as persecution and envy due to wealth, might be more significant motivators for any potential movement towards establishing a nation. Thus, while acknowledging the potential for a nationalistic movement, the articles emphasize external factors over an inherent desire to build a "glorious nation" as the primary motivator.
