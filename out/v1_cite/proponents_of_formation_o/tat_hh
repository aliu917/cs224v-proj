- The persecution of Jews in Europe during the late 19th century was a significant factor that influenced the movement towards the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.
- The idea of Jews returning to Palestine was not initially popular among European Jews, who felt secure and prosperous in countries like England, France, and Germany.
- Economic success and the resulting envy and hatred towards Jews in Europe could have been a catalyst for increased anti-Semitic sentiments, potentially leading to their migration to Palestine.
- The rise of nationalism and the desire to build a "glorious nation" among Jews could have been a significant motivator for the Zionist movement.
