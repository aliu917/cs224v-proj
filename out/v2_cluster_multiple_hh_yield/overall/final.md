# The African-Aid Society is seen as a potential blessing for Africa and the world, suggesting external support could aid in Africa's development.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that the African-Aid Society is seen as a potential blessing for Africa and the world, suggesting that external support could aid in Africa's development. The textbook does not explicitly mention the African-Aid Society or directly support this claim. However, it discusses various organizations and initiatives, such as the African Development Society and the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which aimed to promote African development through external support and collaboration with Afro-Americans. These efforts included educational exchanges, technical missions, and commercial activities intended to enhance Africa's development, while also highlighting the role of external forces, such as missionaries and colonial powers, in shaping Africa's political and economic landscape. In contrast, The African Times articles provide several details supporting the claim, portraying the African-Aid Society as a potential blessing. The articles express a strong belief in Africa's potential for greatness with proper means and divine blessing, as articulated by George Thompson. The Society is depicted as aiming to raise the industrial status of African people by imparting knowledge and skills from the civilized world, emphasizing the need for material aid alongside religious efforts. The mission of the African-Aid Society is described as organizing an "army of regeneration" to bring industrial vigor and productive activity to Africa, supporting the notion of beneficial external intervention. However, the articles also acknowledge the slow progress and challenges in gaining support, indicating a gap between the ideal and the reality of external support. Overall, while the textbook provides historical context on external influences in Africa, The African Times aligns more closely with the claim by advocating for external assistance as a means to foster Africa's development, while recognizing the complexities involved.

# The British government believed that annexing territories near Liberia was necessary to prevent boundary disputes and maintain order.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide contrasting perspectives on the British government's motivations for annexing territories near Liberia. The textbook describes British actions, such as the annexation of the Kanre-Lahun district and the Vai chiefdoms, as driven by competition with other colonial powers, particularly France, and by economic interests, rather than a specific intent to prevent boundary disputes and maintain order. It portrays these actions as aggressive and opportunistic, often disregarding the desires of local populations and the Liberian government, and notes the British government's refusal to guarantee Liberia's sovereignty during President Barclay's visit to London in 1907, suggesting a lack of interest in maintaining order for Liberia's benefit. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim that the British government believed annexing territories was necessary to prevent boundary disputes and maintain order. The articles mention that Liberians argued the British decision to repudiate Liberian claims would lead to renewed boundary troubles, aligning with the claim that annexation was seen as a preventive measure. They also highlight the British perspective that these territories were incapable of advancing in civilization and were a source of continual trouble, suggesting that annexation was considered necessary to maintain order. The articles further suggest that the territories must become either Liberian or English, with a preference for the latter, reinforcing the idea that British annexation was deemed essential. Thus, while the textbook emphasizes economic and competitive motivations, the news articles highlight a perceived necessity for British intervention to prevent disputes and maintain order.

# The belief that a vegetarian and abstinent lifestyle could protect against African diseases indicates a lack of understanding of the local environment and health challenges by Europeans.

The belief that a vegetarian and abstinent lifestyle could protect against African diseases highlights a significant gap in understanding the local environment and health challenges by Europeans, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. While the textbook does not explicitly mention this belief, it underscores the broader lack of preparedness and understanding among Europeans regarding African health challenges. It notes that Europeans were more susceptible to indigenous diseases due to inadequate medical knowledge and resources, as seen in the high mortality rates among European soldiers compared to African soldiers and the late establishment of tropical medical schools. This reflects a broader pattern of misconceptions and prejudices about Africa. The African Times provides a specific instance supporting the claim, detailing Mr. Horsell's misguided confidence that his vegetarian and abstinent lifestyle would protect him from African fever, only to succumb to the disease before reaching his destination. This example underscores the misconception that dietary and lifestyle choices alone could offer protection against tropical diseases, reinforcing the notion that such beliefs were prevalent among Europeans during the mid-19th century. Together, these observations illustrate the disconnect between European perceptions and the realities of health challenges in Africa during that period.

# The expectation of progress in Africa is tied to the expansion of European influence and the spread of Christian values, suggesting a belief in the superiority of European culture and religion.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the claim that the expectation of progress in Africa is tied to the expansion of European influence and the spread of Christian values, suggesting a belief in the superiority of European culture and religion. The textbook supports this claim by highlighting the role of missionaries as agents of European colonialism, who promoted European intervention as morally justified and beneficial for Africa's economic development. They introduced Western education linked to evangelization, creating a Westernized educated African elite, which aligns with the notion of European cultural superiority. However, the textbook also refutes the claim by emphasizing the resilience of African culture and religion, noting that colonialism's cultural impact was relatively superficial and that African traditions persisted, particularly in rural areas. It also mentions the expansion of Islam during colonial rule, which provided an alternative to Christianity and accommodated African traditions more readily, suggesting that the expectation of progress was not solely tied to European influence or Christian values. In contrast, The African Times articles align with the claim by expressing a belief in the civilizing mission of Great Britain, lamenting Dr. Baikie's death, and hoping his work would help penetrate African countries with British civilizing agencies. The articles depict Africa as needing transformation from "darkness to light" and "barbarism to civilization," implying a belief in European cultural superiority. They emphasize the role of Christian values in this transformation, drawing parallels with the mission of Christ and encouraging perseverance in spreading these values despite resistance. While the articles do not explicitly state the superiority of European culture and religion, the language and context imply such a perspective. Overall, both sources present a nuanced view that acknowledges the imposition of European culture and the enduring strength of African traditions, while also reflecting a colonial mindset prevalent during the period.

# The notion of "civilizing" Africa is presented as both a duty and an opportunity for economic gain for Great Britain.

The notion of "civilizing" Africa is presented as both a duty and an opportunity for economic gain for Great Britain, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights that the British government, recognizing the economic potential of their African colonies, aimed to facilitate British commerce and enterprise, as articulated by Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. This aligns with the idea of economic gain. The text also discusses how missionaries, often seen as agents of European colonialism, believed that European intervention would provide security and protection, helping to redress the evils of the slave trade and stimulate economic opportunities for Africans, reflecting a civilizing duty. The British government's White Paper on Kenya emphasized a responsibility or trust towards African populations, suggesting a moral justification for their presence. However, the text critiques the exploitative nature of colonial economic integration, indicating that the civilizing mission was often a guise for economic exploitation. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the responsibility of British property owners to invest in enterprises that would open new markets and develop Africa's resources, suggesting that such efforts would bring wealth and power to the nation. The articles argue that the industrial redemption of Africa and the integration of its population with European civilization is a noble and ambitious task, implying a moral duty. They highlight potential economic benefits, comparing the opportunity to the wealth generated by the East India Company for Britain. The discussion of the River Gambia's cession to France underscores the economic and civilizing interests, advocating for strategic negotiations to enhance British influence and civilization efforts in Africa. Together, these sources support the claim by framing the civilizing mission as both a moral obligation and a strategic economic opportunity for Great Britain, while also acknowledging the exploitative aspects of colonialism.

# The spread of Christianity was anticipated to accompany European colonization, viewed as a positive force for change in Africa.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the spread of Christianity was anticipated to accompany European colonization and was viewed as a positive force for change in Africa. The General History of Africa highlights that missionaries were often seen as agents of European colonialism, consciously paving the way for European intervention, which they believed would bring security, protection, and economic opportunities to Africans. This aligns with the notion that Christianity was expected to accompany colonization as a beneficial force. The text also notes that the spread of Christianity and western education was facilitated by colonial peace and order, supporting the idea of these changes being seen as positive. However, it complicates the claim by acknowledging the limited application of the missionary factor as a general theory of imperialism and the negative impact on African religion and culture, as missionaries sought to eradicate traditional beliefs. Similarly, The African Times articles express a belief in the "spirit of civilized progress" and the "new conquests of the Gospel" as beneficial outcomes of European influence, with missionary societies actively expanding their work in Africa. The anticipation of Africa's "awakening" and the piercing of its "deep darkness" by the "glorious light of Divine Truth" further reinforces the view of Christianity as a positive force. Yet, a critical perspective in the articles questions the effectiveness and sincerity of European influence and missionary efforts, suggesting that the introduction of Christianity and commerce had a "debasing effect" and did not lead to substantial improvement for the local population. This critical view highlights a divergence in perception, indicating that not all contemporary observers agreed with the claim that the spread of Christianity was an unequivocally positive force. Overall, both sources provide a complex interplay between Christianity, colonization, and African societies, supporting and complicating the claim.

# The portrayal of Africa as a "dark continent" reflects a Eurocentric perspective that emphasizes ignorance and moral depravity, which may not accurately represent the diverse cultures and societies within Africa.

The portrayal of Africa as a "dark continent" is a reflection of a Eurocentric perspective that emphasizes ignorance and moral depravity, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details how European colonialists, driven by racism and cultural chauvinism, condemned African culture, including music, art, and history, as inferior or nonexistent. Historians like A. P. Newton and Sir Reginald Coupland exemplified this view by dismissing Africa's pre-colonial history as stagnant and barbaric. The text also highlights the impact of colonialism, noting the humiliation and discrimination faced by Africans, which perpetuated the narrative of Africa's supposed inferiority. Furthermore, the arbitrary partitioning of Africa by European powers, which ignored existing ethnic and cultural boundaries, illustrates the Eurocentric disregard for African societies. Similarly, The African Times articles portray Africa as a "land of gloom" and emphasize the "moral and spiritual darkness" prevailing across the continent, suggesting a need for European civilization and Christianity for Africa's regeneration. This depiction aligns with the Eurocentric narrative by framing African societies as lacking in knowledge and moral integrity, overlooking the diversity and complexity of African cultures. Both sources demonstrate how European perspectives often misrepresented and undervalued the diverse cultures and societies within Africa, supporting the claim of a Eurocentric bias.

# The narrative suggests that European officials in Africa sometimes acted with impunity, disregarding the welfare and rights of local people.

The narrative from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provides compelling evidence supporting the claim that European officials in Africa sometimes acted with impunity, disregarding the welfare and rights of local people. The General History of Africa highlights the abuses inherent in the system of chíbalo, where African laborers faced brutal recruitment methods, low wages, and poor working conditions, often without food or shelter. It also describes the preferential treatment given to white immigrants, the lack of educational opportunities for Africans, and the authoritarian, paternalistic nature of colonial governance, which was not designed to confer political power upon Africans. The imposition of European treaties and the disregard for African sovereignty further illustrate the impunity with which European officials operated, compounded by cultural chauvinism and racial discrimination supported by bogus racial theories and Social Darwinist ideas. Similarly, The African Times articles detail incidents such as Mr. Goldsworthy, the Inspector-General of Police, committing a "gross assault" on an African subordinate, Shepherd, by forcibly removing him from a boat and leaving him stranded without food or shelter. This misuse of power underscores the lack of accountability among European officials. Additionally, the articles discuss the detrimental impact of the liquor trade on African communities, facilitated by European traders who prioritized profit over the well-being of local populations. Both sources collectively depict a pattern of European officials and traders acting with little regard for the consequences of their actions on African people, thereby supporting the claim of impunity and neglect of African rights and welfare.

# The British colonial administration believed that the development of infrastructure would lead to increased exportable produce and colonial revenue.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the British colonial administration believed infrastructure development would lead to increased exportable produce and colonial revenue. The textbook highlights the construction of railways, roads, and harbors primarily to facilitate the evacuation of exports, indicating a focus on enhancing the export sector. Investments in irrigation projects, such as the Aswan Dam, aimed at boosting cotton production, underscore the administration's strategy to secure raw materials for their textile industry. Fiscal reforms and capital expenditure directed towards promoting the export sector further reinforce this belief. Similarly, The African Times articles discuss the projected Gold Coast Light Railways as a means to significantly increase exportable produce and colonial revenue, emphasizing railways' potential to transform human carriers into producers and facilitate the flow of goods, including gold. The articles also highlight railways as a tool for spreading Christian civilization and economic development in West Africa, connecting British sea-coast possessions with the interior to promote trade. In the Congo region, railways are seen as a means to overcome natural barriers and invite European capital to exploit fertile lands. However, the articles also reveal a tension between the colonial administration's goals and local resistance or indifference, a nuanced aspect not directly addressed in the claim. Together, these sources illustrate the British colonial administration's prioritization of infrastructure development to enhance economic exploitation and revenue generation, while also acknowledging the complexities of local responses.

# The idea of forming a company modeled after the East India Company was suggested to protect investments and facilitate the development of trade and infrastructure in Africa.

The idea of forming a company modeled after the East India Company to protect investments and facilitate the development of trade and infrastructure in Africa is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa discusses the emergence of the British East Africa Company, which was part of plans to build roads to Lake Nyasa and Lake Victoria, indicating an imperialistic organization aimed at developing trade infrastructure. This aligns with the claim of forming a company to protect investments and develop trade. The text also highlights the role of European commercial firms in connecting Africa with Western markets, similar to the East India Company's role in Asia, although it does not explicitly mention modeling a company after the East India Company. In contrast, The African Times provides explicit support for the claim, with Commander Cameron advocating for the establishment of such a company, arguing that capitalists need protection for their investments. The articles mention the Royal Niger Company and the East Africa Company as examples of chartered companies working to open up and civilize Africa, aligning with the proposed model. While the articles do not detail the specific structure or operations of these companies compared to the East India Company, they emphasize the role of chartered companies in Africa's trade and infrastructure development. Together, these sources highlight the significance of companies in facilitating trade and infrastructure, with The African Times providing more direct support for the claim of modeling them after the East India Company.

# The narrative implies that European investment and infrastructure, such as railways, are necessary to fully exploit the economic potential of the Congo region.

The narrative from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles supports the claim that European investment and infrastructure, such as railways, were seen as necessary to exploit the economic potential of the Congo region. The General History of Africa highlights the significant expansion of the railway network in the Belgian Congo, particularly around the mines, financed by the state and private companies to facilitate the extraction and export of minerals like copper. This infrastructure development was primarily a speculative venture for profit, serving the interests of European companies and colonial powers rather than the local population, indicating an exploitative colonial economic system. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the necessity of European capital and enterprise, with Mr. Stanley describing the Congo State's vast natural resources and the need for a railway to overcome navigational challenges. The articles also discuss the role of chartered companies in opening up and civilizing Africa, suggesting European involvement as essential for economic progress. However, they acknowledge challenges such as educating the local population and climate difficulties, indicating that European investment alone may not suffice without addressing these issues. Both sources present a nuanced view that aligns with the claim, highlighting the reliance on European resources while acknowledging the complexities and uneven distribution of benefits.

# The suppression of the slave trade and establishment of settlements and missionary stations were highlighted as evidence of Europe's positive influence in Africa.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced and multifaceted perspective on the claim that the suppression of the slave trade and the establishment of settlements and missionary stations were evidence of Europe's positive influence in Africa. The General History of Africa acknowledges that while missionaries introduced education and new technologies, they also paved the way for European colonialism, often acting as agents for their own countries' interests. The abolition of the slave trade, though mentioned, was not African-inspired and primarily targeted Atlantic slave-owners. The text highlights that African societies were capable of economic adaptation independently, as seen in the transition to 'legitimate' trade like cash crops, without direct European rule. It also discusses the negative impact of colonial rule, which imposed racial policies and restricted African participation in education and commerce, with European settlers often obstructing African development. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by highlighting the pride in sacrifices made for the suppression of the slave trade and portraying West Coast settlements as centers of secular enlightenment. Missionary stations are described positively as "stars twinkling in the night of heathendom," suggesting their role in spreading civilization and religious conversion. However, the articles also note the self-interest and commercial motives behind these actions, contrasting with the purely altruistic narrative. Together, these sources present a complex view of European influence, acknowledging both the perceived benefits and the underlying self-interests and detrimental impacts.

# The involvement of the Secretary of State in enforcing this decree highlights the centralized control and bureaucratic approach of colonial powers in managing African territories.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively highlight the centralized control and bureaucratic approach of colonial powers in managing African territories, though they differ in specific details. The General History of Africa textbook emphasizes the centralized nature of colonial administration, particularly in the French, Portuguese, and Belgian systems, where legislative authority was retained in the metropolis. It describes the bureaucratization of colonial administration during the inter-war years, with European administrators exercising significant control and using indigenous personnel in subordinate roles, underscoring a bureaucratic approach. However, it does not specifically mention the involvement of a Secretary of State in enforcing decrees. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence of centralized control by mentioning the Secretary of State's role in enforcing a decree that includes penal servitude and fines for acts like mutilating corpses and cannibalism, reflecting a structured enforcement mechanism typical of colonial administration. While this highlights the authoritative role of high-ranking officials in implementing laws, the articles do not delve into the broader bureaucratic strategies or administrative structures, focusing instead on specific legal measures. Together, these sources support the notion of centralized and bureaucratic colonial management but reveal gaps in discussing the Secretary of State's involvement and broader governance strategies.

# The Dahomey kingdom engaged in slave raids, capturing individuals from neighboring areas to be sold or sacrificed.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the Dahomey kingdom engaged in slave raids, capturing individuals from neighboring areas to be sold or sacrificed. The textbook describes Dahomey as a state heavily involved in the slave trade, with its economy almost solely based on it. King Gezo's economic policy was driven by the demand for slaves from Portuguese dealers, and the kingdom conducted systematic invasions of Yorubaland and other neighboring areas to secure captives for export, labor, and human sacrifice. Despite British and French abolitionist pressures, Dahomey continued its slave trade, underscoring its economic reliance on this practice. The African Times articles corroborate these accounts, detailing expeditions where Dahomian warriors captured hundreds of individuals, including men, women, and children, from surrounding regions. The captives were often brought to the King, where the elderly were killed, and the younger ones were sold into slavery. The articles also highlight the use of captives in human sacrifices during royal customs and ceremonies, providing personal accounts of the brutal treatment and eventual sale or sacrifice of captives. Together, these sources paint a vivid picture of Dahomey's active participation in capturing individuals for the slave trade and sacrificial purposes, emphasizing the kingdom's structured approach to slave raiding and trading.

# The King of Dahomey used public ceremonies to display power and wealth by distributing goods to his people.

The claim that the King of Dahomey used public ceremonies to display power and wealth by distributing goods to his people is supported by observations from The African Times, which describe ceremonies where the King sat on a platform and distributed items such as cowries, cloths, and tobacco to his people. This act of distribution during the Attor custom is portrayed as a direct demonstration of his power and generosity. However, the articles also highlight a more violent aspect of these customs, such as the Sorsi custom, where people are killed as part of the ceremony, providing a broader context of how the King displayed power through both generosity and fear. In contrast, the General History of Africa textbook does not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim. It mentions that political stability in Dahomey was maintained through a centralized administration and economic policies under King Gezo, focusing on the slave and palm oil trade, but it does not specifically mention public ceremonies or the distribution of goods as a means of displaying power and wealth. This absence of information in the textbook suggests that such practices may not have been a documented or emphasized aspect of Dahomey's historical narrative in this source, highlighting an interesting difference in the portrayal of Dahomey's history between the two sources.

# The relationship between the King of Dahomey and England improved significantly after the visit of Commodore Wilmot, indicating the potential impact of diplomatic efforts.

The claim that the relationship between the King of Dahomey and England improved significantly after the visit of Commodore Wilmot, indicating the potential impact of diplomatic efforts, is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information about Commodore Wilmot's visit or any subsequent improvement in relations between Dahomey and England. Instead, it focuses on the broader context of British and French abolitionist efforts to end the slave trade in Dahomey and transition to legitimate trade, particularly in palm oil, under King Gezo. The textbook highlights the challenges faced by European abolitionists due to the continued interest of Brazilian and Portuguese traders in the slave trade, and while it mentions diplomatic missions and treaties in other regions, it does not reference Commodore Wilmot or a significant diplomatic effort with Dahomey. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing a positive shift in the King's attitude towards England following Commodore Wilmot's visit, noting a newfound respect and improved relations. The articles also mention a reduction in the number of men killed during the annual custom, possibly influenced by Wilmot's discussions, suggesting a diplomatic impact. However, they also highlight the King's ongoing threats to invade Abeokuta and continued sacrifices, indicating that while relations with England may have improved, the King's broader military ambitions remain unchanged. This complexity suggests that diplomatic efforts may have had a positive impact on relations with England, but have not entirely altered the King's aggressive actions towards neighboring regions.

# The economic interests of British colonies, such as the Gold Coast and Lagos, were negatively impacted by Dahomey's raids, providing a financial motive for British intervention.

The claim that the economic interests of British colonies, such as the Gold Coast and Lagos, were negatively impacted by Dahomey's raids, providing a financial motive for British intervention, is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim, focusing instead on the broader economic and political dynamics involving Dahomey, such as its transition from the slave trade to the palm oil trade and its confrontations with European powers like France. There is no specific mention of Dahomey's raids affecting British colonies or their economic interests, suggesting that the textbook does not directly associate Dahomey's actions with economic motives for British intervention in the Gold Coast or Lagos. In contrast, The African Times articles provide several details supporting the claim. They describe how Dahomey's yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories near Abeokuta, aimed at plunder and capturing victims for sacrifice, significantly harmed the industrious Egba agriculturists. This disruption not only affected the local population but also negatively impacted the revenues of Lagos, as the agricultural industry suffered due to the annual scares and resulting desertion of farms. The articles emphasize that stopping these raids would substantially increase agricultural production in the Egba countries, benefiting the British colonies. Additionally, they highlight that Dahomey's actions as a marauding state prejudicially interfered with the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony, aligning with the claim that economic interests were a significant factor in motivating British intervention in Dahomey.

# The Dahomian king used human sacrifices and fetish rituals to prepare for potential conflicts with foreign powers, such as the English.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the claim that the Dahomian king used human sacrifices and fetish rituals to prepare for potential conflicts with foreign powers, such as the English. The textbook does not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim, focusing instead on the Dahomey invasions of Yorubaland and the use of war captives for labor in the palm oil industry. It mentions human sacrifice in the context of annual customs rather than military preparation, suggesting that the textbook does not emphasize or corroborate the claim regarding the Dahomian king's use of such practices for conflict preparation with foreign powers. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim, describing how the king of Dahomey conducted human sacrifices and fetish rituals, including the creation of a wooden vessel representing an English ship of war, as part of preparations against potential English military actions. These rituals were intended to render English ships immobile and vulnerable to the Dahomian army. The articles also mention that several captives were killed and offered as sacrifices before the king's expedition, indicating the use of human sacrifices as part of military preparations. Furthermore, the British abhorrence of these practices is highlighted, with a treaty stipulating that British subjects were exempt from attending such rituals, suggesting awareness and concern about these practices linked to Dahomey's military and diplomatic strategies. Overall, while the textbook does not address the claim, the articles provide evidence that aligns with the assertion regarding the Dahomian king's use of human sacrifices and fetish rituals in the context of potential conflicts with foreign powers.

# The King of Dahomey was perceived as a significant threat to the stability and safety of Abeokuta.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both support the claim that the King of Dahomey was perceived as a significant threat to the stability and safety of Abeokuta. The textbook details how Dahomey viewed the rise of the Egba-Yoruba state of Abeokuta as a threat to its independence, leading to military confrontations, including direct attacks in 1851 and 1864, although these were unsuccessful. The ongoing raids by Dahomey into Yoruba territories, including those near Abeokuta, further illustrate the persistent threat posed by Dahomey, driven by motivations such as state security and the demand for slaves. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the fear and anticipation of potential calamity expressed by correspondents from the Wesleyan Missionary Society, who were concerned about the King's threats to invade Abeokuta. The historical context of a previous inroad into Abeokutan territory, when the people were off guard, underscores the perceived threat, while the King's violent customs, including sacrifices, contribute to the perception of danger. However, the articles also note skepticism about the immediacy of the threat, suggesting that an attack might not occur in the current month but could happen anytime during the dry season, indicating a complex perception of the threat. Together, these sources depict the King of Dahomey as a formidable and unpredictable force, posing a significant threat to Abeokuta's stability and safety.

# The Dahomey Kingdom was notorious for its violent practices.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the Dahomey Kingdom was notorious for its violent practices. The textbook details systematic invasions of Yorubaland by Dahomey, driven by the demand for slaves and state security, which led to the destruction of towns and communities. It highlights Dahomey's persistent engagement in the slave trade, even in the face of British efforts to abolish it, and its eventual shift to the palm oil trade, which still involved using war captives as labor. The text also describes Dahomey's military confrontations with the French, employing guerrilla tactics and mobilizing a large army, resulting in significant casualties. Meanwhile, The African Times articles provide vivid accounts of the Dahomey King's pleasure in beheading individuals, particularly during annual customs, to instill fear in neighboring countries. The articles recount the King's resentment towards the English for prohibiting the slave trade, leading to the killing of war captives, and describe the ritualistic killing of over 1,500 individuals to accompany the late King Gezo in the afterlife. They also highlight the capture and enslavement of people from neighboring regions, with the elderly being killed and the young sold into slavery, prompting British interest in intervening to halt Dahomey's violent expeditions. Together, these sources paint a picture of Dahomey's aggressive military actions, brutal practices, and complex historical narrative, underscoring its reputation for violence and its impact on regional politics and international relations.

# The potential intervention of European powers in Dahomey due to its practices.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view of the potential intervention of European powers in Dahomey due to its practices. The textbook highlights the economic interests of European powers, particularly the transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, which significantly influenced European involvement in the region. Dahomey's persistent engagement in the slave trade, despite British anti-slave trade measures, and its eventual shift to palm oil trade under French influence, are noted as key factors. The French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, partly due to Dahomey's resistance to French protectorate claims over Porto Novo, underscores direct intervention motivated by strategic and economic interests. The involvement of Brazilian Africans in supporting French colonial efforts further illustrates the complex interplay of local and foreign interests. Meanwhile, The African Times articles emphasize the atrocities and despotism of Dahomey authorities, suggesting these actions would provoke a response from European countries, particularly Great Britain. The visit of the British squadron to Whydah, the inquiry into reported outrages, and the imposition of a fine on the King of Dahomey are presented as initial steps towards intervention. The articles also discuss the potential for military action, drawing parallels to the British campaign against Ashanti, and highlight Great Britain's strategic interests in the region. Additionally, the role of local entities, such as the people of Abeokuta, in supporting British efforts, suggests a complex interplay between European powers and local dynamics. Together, these details support the claim that European powers were motivated to intervene in Dahomey due to its practices, driven by both moral and strategic considerations.

# The presence of foreign dignitaries and missionaries at the Malagasy royal ceremony suggests a period of diplomatic engagement and cultural exchange between Madagascar and European nations.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of diplomatic engagement and cultural exchange between Madagascar and European nations, albeit with some differences in emphasis. The textbook highlights King Radama II's efforts to modernize Madagascar by attracting foreign traders, investors, and missionaries, and his diplomatic missions to France and Britain to seek recognition as king. The presence of European consuls like Jean Laborde from France and Conolly Pakenham from Britain in Antananarivo, along with the arrival of missionaries such as Père Jouen and Reverend W. Ellis, underscores a period of active diplomatic and cultural interactions. British missionaries' influence in education and technical skills further contributed to Madagascar's modernization. However, the textbook does not specifically mention a Malagasy royal ceremony attended by foreign dignitaries and missionaries. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the ceremonial aspects, noting the presence of officers from England and France at a Malagasy royal ceremony, which indicates diplomatic relationships. The King wearing a British field-marshal's uniform presented by Queen Victoria suggests cultural exchange, while the mention of missionaries receiving the hasina implies foreign religious influences. Although the articles do not detail specific diplomatic discussions or agreements, they emphasize the ceremonial presence of foreign dignitaries. Together, these sources illustrate a period of diplomatic engagement and cultural exchange, with the textbook providing broader context and the articles highlighting specific ceremonial interactions.

# The enthusiastic participation of spectators, who contributed to the "music" with their voices and hand movements, indicates a communal approach to celebration and music-making.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the claim of enthusiastic spectator participation in communal celebration and music-making. The General History of Africa provides several instances that align with this claim, such as the Kuyu people's funeral ceremonies, which involved a dusk-to-dawn sequence of song, dance, and symbolic mime, serving as a communal activity to affirm life continuity and economic survival. This reflects a collective approach to music-making, where the community actively engages in the performance. Similarly, the mbira music of the Shona people was deeply integrated into social life, with both settled and itinerant performers, indicating widespread communal involvement. The night-long bira ceremonies, featuring dancing, singing, and recitals, further emphasize this communal nature. Additionally, the Idoma's judicial processes, with their semi-choric pattern of case presentation and choric responses, highlight the communal integration of music and oratory. Complementing these historical insights, The African Times articles describe how spectators contribute to the "music" by tapping their mouths with their palms, yelling, and shouting, creating a continuous and loud noise. This illustrates a communal approach to celebration, where music is produced not by a separate group of musicians but through the collective efforts of the gathered people. However, the articles also note a distinction in focus, as another section highlights the presence of the Royal Family, foreign guests, and the ceremonial aspects involving the Queen and King, without mentioning the active participation of the general populace in music-making. Together, these observations affirm the communal nature of music-making and celebration, while also acknowledging the ceremonial roles of dignitaries.

# Governor Pine's administration was unfairly criticized for the Ashantee conflict, despite his efforts to address issues.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the claim that Governor Pine's administration was unfairly criticized for the Ashantee conflict. The textbook does not provide specific information directly addressing this claim, focusing instead on a poll tax instituted by Governor Pine in 1852, which faced resistance due to revenue misallocation and was abandoned in 1864. This resistance was unrelated to the Ashantee conflict, and the textbook discusses various 19th-century conflicts involving the Asante without linking them to Pine's administration. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim, arguing that Governor Pine was unfairly criticized for the Ashantee conflict. They assert that Pine, who had recently assumed his position on the Gold Coast, was dealing with the aftermath of past maladministration and was not responsible for the Ashantee invasion. The articles highlight that the conflict's roots lay in a civil war between Agiman and King Attah of the Akims, mismanaged by previous administrations. Pine is depicted as a diligent leader who attempted to resolve these disputes by sending commissioners to arrange peace, thus safeguarding the Protectorate. The articles emphasize that the Ashantee incursion resulted from Akim disunity, a situation Pine inherited. They also suggest that Pine's critics, particularly those of his own skin, may have been motivated by personal grudges rather than legitimate grievances. Overall, the articles defend Pine's actions, suggesting his administration was unjustly blamed for the conflict, aligning with the claim that his efforts were not adequately recognized.

# The defeat of the Dahomans at Abeokuta marked a significant military loss, highlighting the effectiveness of Egba resistance.

The defeat of the Dahomans at Abeokuta marked a significant military loss, underscoring the effectiveness of Egba resistance, as detailed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights two direct attacks by Dahomey against Abeokuta in 1851 and 1864, both resulting in resounding failures for Dahomey, demonstrating the strength of the Egba resistance. It also notes an earlier clash in 1844 at Ado-Odo, which sowed seeds of future acrimony between the two, further illustrating the military prowess of the Egba. However, the textbook does not explicitly state that these defeats were turning points or discuss broader implications beyond these encounters. In contrast, The African Times articles vividly describe a fierce battle where the Dahomans, including their renowned Amazons, suffered heavy casualties, with nearly 200 killed in the first hour alone, and were unable to overcome the Egba defenses. The Egbas, driven by the defense of their homes and liberty, effectively repelled the Dahoman forces, capturing numerous prisoners and weapons, including the king's horse. The articles emphasize the demoralization of the Dahoman forces due to lack of water and heat, contributing to their defeat, and note the significant impact of the loss, as evidenced by the King of Dahomey's "crestfallen" return and the decision not to hold the annual Kannah Custom. Together, these sources illustrate the substantial impact of the defeat on the Dahomans and highlight the effectiveness of the Egba resistance.

# The Dahoman army's structured military hierarchy is indicated by its organization into battalions led by chiefs.

The claim that the Dahoman army had a structured military hierarchy indicated by its organization into battalions led by chiefs is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information about the Dahoman army being organized into battalions led by chiefs. It mentions that King Behanzin mobilized his troops, which included a permanent army of 4,000 men and women, supported by the Amazons, who were female warriors. However, the text focuses on the mobilization of troops and the modernization of the army through the acquisition of modern weaponry, without detailing a structured military hierarchy or organization into battalions led by chiefs. In contrast, The African Times news articles support the claim by detailing that the Dahoman army was organized into four battalions, each led by a chief—specifically named as "Migen," "Mewu," "Ajawo," and "Topo." These chiefs were entitled to symbols of dignity, such as a stool, flag, and umbrella, indicating a structured hierarchy within the military organization. This aligns with the claim, as the presence of battalions and designated leaders suggests an organized command structure. The articles do not provide any information that refutes the claim, and the details about the chiefs and their symbols of authority are consistent with the notion of a hierarchical military organization. Thus, while the General History of Africa does not directly support or refute the claim, The African Times provides evidence that aligns with it.

# The situation in Dahomey illustrates the broader geopolitical tensions between European powers over African territories during the colonial period.

The situation in Dahomey during the colonial period serves as a compelling illustration of the broader geopolitical tensions between European powers over African territories, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the Anglo-French rivalry, particularly in the partition and control of territories like Porto Novo and western Yorubaland, with the French conquest of Dahomey in 1892 and the subsequent Anglo-French Partition of Borgu in 1895 as key outcomes of this rivalry. It also notes the strategic importance of ports like Lagos and Porto Novo and the entry of Germany into the competition in the 1880s, adding complexity to the European power struggle. Meanwhile, The African Times articles emphasize the conflict between British and French interests, with French agents influencing the King of Dahomey to resist British demands and the British attempting to enforce a blockade, countered by French intervention. The articles also highlight the economic motivations behind these tensions, such as the influence of Marseilles mercantile interests on the French government, and the strategic importance of Whydah as a seaport, enriched by the historical context of the slave trade. The potential for military conflict, with the French considering serious measures against Dahomey, further underscores the colonial practice of using force to assert control. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the rivalry and strategic maneuvering characteristic of European colonial powers in Africa, with Dahomey as a significant, though not central, example of these dynamics.

# The slave trade in the Bight of Benin was closely linked to the demand for slaves in Cuba, prompting British intervention to halt exports from Dahomey.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary insights into the claim that the slave trade in the Bight of Benin was closely linked to the demand for slaves in Cuba, prompting British intervention to halt exports from Dahomey. The textbook highlights Dahomey's significant involvement in the slave trade as a persistent slave-raiding and trading state, noting British and French abolitionist efforts that led to a transition towards 'legitimate' trade, such as palm oil. While it emphasizes British intervention through treaties and naval actions to suppress the slave trade, it does not explicitly connect this to the demand for slaves in Cuba, focusing instead on broader European efforts to end the trade. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly link the slave trade in Dahomey to Cuban plantations, citing the shipment of nearly 1,000 slaves to Cuba and underscoring the economic incentives for both the King of Dahomey and Cuban planters reliant on slave labor for sugar production. The articles further detail British interest in ending the slave trade in the region, highlighting efforts to establish amicable relations with Dahomey and the potential imposition of duties on imports at Whydah to mitigate the economic impact of ceasing the trade. Together, these sources illustrate the economic motivations behind the slave trade and the specific British efforts to intervene and halt the export of slaves from Dahomey to Cuba.

# The British settlements on the West Coast of Africa were largely ineffective in suppressing the slave trade due to the persistent demand for slaves, particularly from Cuba.

The claim that British settlements on the West Coast of Africa were largely ineffective in suppressing the slave trade due to persistent demand, particularly from Cuba, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, though with some nuances. The General History of Africa notes that despite British abolition efforts, the slave trade continued robustly, driven by strong demand from regions like Cuba, where slave imports increased significantly during certain periods. The British faced challenges such as weak political authority in their settlements and limited naval patrols, capturing only a small fraction of slave-trading vessels. The persistent demand for slave-produced goods, like Cuban sugar, which saw a quadrupling of exports between 1830 and 1864, further fueled the trade. The African Times articles echo the persistent demand as a significant factor, acknowledging that a blockading squadron alone could not stop the trade. However, they also highlight that British settlements and the Republic of Liberia had some success in eradicating the slave trade from most of the coast, except in areas like the dominions of the King of Dahomey, suggesting some effectiveness contrary to the claim. Additionally, the coexistence of legitimate commerce, such as the palm-oil trade, with the slave trade indicates that economic activities did not necessarily eliminate slavery. Together, these observations provide a nuanced view that both supports and challenges the claim, emphasizing the complexity of the issue.

# The mention of fighting on the West Coast suggests ongoing conflicts and resistance against colonial powers in that region.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both touch upon the theme of ongoing conflicts and resistance against colonial powers on the West Coast of Africa, albeit with varying levels of detail. The General History of Africa provides a comprehensive overview of the period from 1880 to 1914, highlighting significant military actions and resistance across West Africa, excluding Liberia, as colonial powers like France and Britain sought to assert control. Notable instances of resistance include the French campaigns in the Western Sudan, Ivory Coast, and Dahomey, as well as the British campaigns in Asante and the Niger Delta region. The textbook emphasizes that African reactions were influenced by local contexts, suggesting widespread resistance, though it does not specifically isolate "fighting on the West Coast" as a distinct event. In contrast, The African Times includes a mention of "The Fighting on the West Coast" in its table of contents, which aligns with the claim of ongoing conflicts in the region. However, the articles lack further details or context about these conflicts, such as the parties involved or the underlying causes, leaving open the possibility that the fighting could be related to various issues beyond colonial resistance. This absence of detail is significant, as it neither explicitly confirms nor refutes the claim of resistance against colonial powers. Together, these sources suggest a recognition of resistance but differ in the specificity and context provided.

# The detailed records of commodity prices and sales volumes suggest a well-established trade network and the presence of organized commercial activities in Africa.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of a well-established trade network and organized commercial activities in Africa, albeit from different perspectives. The "General History of Africa" describes various trading networks, such as the Portuguese-African, Swahili, and trans-Saharan trades, characterized by established routes, staging posts, and trade conventions. These networks facilitated the exchange of commodities like ivory, slaves, iron, salt, and agricultural products, indicating organized commercial activities. Specific trade routes, such as those leading to Luanda, Benguela, and the Swahili coast, and the role of European commercial firms in connecting Africa with Western markets, further underscore the existence of a structured trade system. However, the text lacks detailed records of commodity prices and sales volumes, suggesting that such data may not have been systematically maintained or emphasized historically. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide detailed records of commodity prices and sales volumes, listing commodities like palm oil, cotton, coffee, ginger, and palm kernels with specific prices, quantities, and origins. This indicates a structured market system, with consistent reporting of sales over different periods and locations, such as Liverpool markets, suggesting a regular and organized trade flow. The articles highlight price fluctuations and market conditions, implying a sophisticated understanding of market operations. However, they do not explicitly discuss the infrastructure or entities managing these trade networks, which could suggest a difference if the claim implies a more formalized institutional presence. Together, these sources illustrate the complexity and organization of trade activities in Africa, with the textbook emphasizing the historical network structures and the articles providing detailed economic data.

# The pricing and demand for African commodities like palm oil and cotton suggest a structured market system influenced by European industrial needs.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the pricing and demand for African commodities like palm oil and cotton were influenced by European industrial needs, suggesting a structured market system. The General History of Africa highlights the significant role of European commercial firms in linking Africa with Western European and American markets, emphasizing their influence on the trade of commodities such as palm oil, timber, and rubber. This demand was driven by Europe's industrial needs, as evidenced by the "extraordinary demands on production" and the expansion of the palm oil trade in the Niger delta. The text also notes that African export sectors focused on unprocessed agricultural products and minerals of relatively low value, indicating a market system prioritizing European industrial requirements. Monoculture economies in African colonies, sensitive to international trade conditions, further illustrate this influence. However, the textbook does not explicitly discuss pricing mechanisms, leaving a gap in the direct connection between European needs and pricing structures. In contrast, The African Times articles frequently mention pricing and demand fluctuations for commodities like palm oil and cotton, indicating a market responsive to external factors, likely including European industrial demands. The articles describe market conditions such as "active demand" or "dull market," and price changes like "advance in price" or "prices rather lower," suggesting a structured market system influenced by European industries. Detailed reporting on the quality and origin of commodities, such as "African bold berry" coffee or "Benin" palm oil, supports the idea of a structured market catering to specific industrial requirements. However, the articles do not explicitly mention European industrial needs. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of European influence on African commodity markets, aligning with the claim, though each source highlights different aspects of this influence.

# The presence of African commodities like palm kernels and palm oil in international markets highlights Africa's contribution to global trade networks.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant role of African commodities like palm kernels and palm oil in global trade networks. The textbook provides a historical perspective, highlighting the emergence of palm oil as a major export from the Niger delta, which replaced the slave trade as the leading export by 1840. This shift marked a transformation in Africa's economic relations with the world, integrating African economies into the capitalist world-economy. The export of palm oil and groundnuts facilitated the spread of European products among the masses, underscoring Africa's role in the global market. However, it also notes the exploitative nature of this integration, as Africa did not develop an economy capable of competing with Europe's industrialized economy. Meanwhile, The African Times articles provide contemporary evidence of Africa's contribution to global trade through detailed accounts of the sale and pricing of palm kernels and palm oil in international markets, such as Liverpool. These articles highlight active trade and demand, with frequent mentions of sales, prices, and market conditions. While they focus on specific market transactions, they align with the claim by illustrating the presence and significance of African commodities in global trade. Together, these sources affirm Africa's active participation in global trade networks, while also acknowledging the complexities and challenges of this integration.

# The African continent was a significant source of various commodities such as coffee, ginger, and palm oil, which were traded in global markets during the 19th century.

The claim that the African continent was a significant source of various commodities such as coffee, ginger, and palm oil, which were traded in global markets during the 19th century, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences in emphasis. The General History of Africa highlights the rise of palm oil as a major export product in West Africa, particularly in the Niger delta area, and its role in transforming productive structures and economic relations. It notes the shift from the slave trade to legitimate trade, with palm oil, groundnuts, and rubber being significant exports, but does not mention coffee or ginger as major African exports during this period. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence of African coffee, specifically "African encomge" and "African bold berry," being traded at various prices, indicating its presence in the global market. The articles also list African ginger with specific prices, supporting the claim, although ginger is not as prominently mentioned as coffee and palm oil. Palm oil is frequently referenced, with details about its trade, including prices and origins such as Lagos and Benin. Together, these sources confirm Africa's role in supplying these commodities to global markets during the 19th century, with the textbook focusing more on palm oil and the articles providing additional evidence for coffee and ginger.

---

# The fluctuation in prices and demand for African commodities like palm oil and cotton suggests a volatile market influenced by supply and demand dynamics.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the market for African commodities like palm oil and cotton is volatile, influenced by supply and demand dynamics. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the rise and fall of the palm oil trade in the Niger delta, which initially co-existed with the slave trade and later flourished independently until its decline at the end of the century, indicating fluctuating demand and market conditions. It also describes the dramatic expansion of coffee and maize production in Kenya, with a significant increase in export value from 1913 to 1930, suggesting a volatile market driven by changing demand. Additionally, the textbook notes the unsteady increase in mineral prices starting in 1927, with a clear downward trend in 1931, and the drop in rubber prices in Bailundu, further illustrating market volatility. However, it lacks specific details on cotton's market dynamics. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide specific insights into the fluctuations in prices and demand for both palm oil and cotton. They report significant variations in palm oil prices, with instances of both price increases and decreases, and describe the demand for cotton as variable, with periods of increased demand leading to price advances, while other times the market is described as dull with lower prices. These observations from the articles align with the claim, as they consistently highlight the variability in market conditions for these commodities, directly linking changes in demand and supply to price fluctuations. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the volatile market for African commodities, driven by supply and demand dynamics.

# The presence of European expeditions in Africa during the 19th century indicates a period of exploration and possibly imperial interest in the region.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the presence of European expeditions in Africa during the 19th century indicates a period of exploration and possibly imperial interest in the region. The textbook provides substantial evidence of European explorers, traders, and missionaries, such as Carl Peters in East Africa and H. M. Stanley in the Congo, who ventured into Africa often under the auspices of their respective nations or colonial societies. These expeditions were driven not only by scientific curiosity but also by strategic and imperial interests, as highlighted by the Berlin Conference and the subsequent partitioning of Africa. The role of missionaries as agents of colonialism further paved the way for European intervention, while competition among European powers like Britain, France, and Germany for territorial acquisitions underscores the imperial motivations behind these expeditions. The African Times articles complement this by detailing specific expeditions, such as Sir S. Baker's journey to the Upper Nile and Lieut. Cameron's travels discussed at the Royal Geographical Society's meeting, which highlight the European interest in African exploration. Cameron's remarks on the abundance of resources like ivory, nutmeg, and oil-producing palms suggest economic interests aligned with imperial ambitions. Additionally, trading agreements with local groups, such as the Qua Town people, indicate European involvement in local trade, serving as a precursor to more formal imperial control. Both sources illustrate a period of European exploration intertwined with imperial ambitions, while acknowledging the complex interplay of internal and external factors in Africa's 19th-century history.

# The deposition and exile of King Ja-Ja highlight the British influence and intervention in local African leadership and governance.

The deposition and exile of King Ja-Ja serve as a significant example of British influence and intervention in local African leadership and governance, as detailed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook describes how King Jaja of Opobo resisted British demands to cease levying duties on English traders, which led to his arrest and deportation to the West Indies after being lured onto a British ship under false promises of safe conduct. This incident exemplifies the British strategy of undermining local sovereignty and imposing control over trade and governance. The textbook further highlights similar interventions, such as the removal of Nana Olomu in Itsekiriland and the establishment of governing councils in the Niger Delta states, underscoring a pattern of British interference in African leadership. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide detailed information about King Ja-Ja's deposition and exile, merely listing it as a topic in the table of contents without offering context, analysis, or narrative. This absence of specific content in The African Times is notable, as it underscores a gap where one might expect historical details or commentary on such a significant event in African colonial history.

# The use of advanced weaponry by British forces highlights the technological disparity between colonial powers and African communities.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the use of advanced weaponry by British forces highlights the technological disparity between colonial powers and African communities. The textbook details how, by 1880, European powers, including the British, had access to advanced technologies such as the steamship, railway, telegraph, and notably, the Maxim gun, which was a significant advancement over the muzzle-loading muskets used by African forces. The Europeans' possession of breech-loading rifles and rapid-fire Maxims, with their superior rate of fire and power, underscores this technological gap. The monopolization of arms and ammunition was a critical factor in maintaining the balance of power, with European powers regulating the supply of arms to African rulers. Agreements like the Sand River Convention and the Brussels General Act of 1890, which forbade the sale of firearms to Africans, further illustrate the strategic efforts to maintain this disparity. The African Times articles complement this by describing specific instances where British forces, equipped with advanced weaponry such as rocket batteries, howitzers, and 7-pounder cannons, effectively used these technologies in military campaigns against African communities. For example, the British expeditionary force's use of a rocket battery to set the town of Kwatamahoo on fire and the deployment of cannons and rocket troughs to overcome ambuscades in the Krepi country highlight the significant role of advanced weaponry in achieving military objectives. Together, these sources illustrate how the British leveraged their superior military technology to dominate African territories, despite some African societies' attempts to acquire modern weapons through trade and diplomacy.

# The presence of marines in the Congo was used to facilitate the interests of European traders, often against the will of local populations.

The claim that the presence of marines in the Congo was used to facilitate the interests of European traders, often against the will of local populations, finds varying degrees of support in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not explicitly mention marines in the Congo being used for this purpose, but it provides a broader context of European influence in Africa, including the Congo. It highlights the economic and political pressures exerted by European traders and colonial powers, leading to local resistance and uprisings due to imposed taxes, forced labor, and resource exploitation. This context suggests a pattern of European interests being prioritized over local autonomy, aligning with the claim, though the specific role of marines is not detailed. In contrast, The African Times articles offer more direct evidence supporting the claim, describing operations starting on August 29th where marines were deployed to Chimpoza to facilitate the interests of A. M. Pape, a European trader, against local opposition. The marines' presence was necessary because locals refused to allow Pape to abandon his factory, indicating enforcement of the trader's interests. The articles also mention the destruction of villages and plantations, suggesting military intervention to suppress local resistance and secure European interests. While the articles do not explicitly state the motivations behind these military actions, they align with the broader theme of prioritizing European commercial interests at the expense of local communities. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view of the claim, with the textbook offering contextual support and the news articles providing specific instances of marine involvement.

# The actions of Mr. Ussher, the British Administrator, suggest a lack of genuine authority or willingness to enforce British rule, as he privately expressed a desire for the people to act discreetly rather than openly.

The claim that Mr. Ussher, the British Administrator, exhibited a lack of genuine authority or willingness to enforce British rule is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook does not mention Mr. Ussher or provide evidence related to his actions or attitudes, focusing instead on broader themes of colonial administration and resistance without delving into the specifics of individual administrators like Mr. Ussher. This absence might be significant, indicating that the textbook prioritizes overarching historical narratives over detailed accounts of every administrator's behavior. In contrast, The African Times provides specific details supporting the claim, noting that Mr. Ussher was aware of the Cape Coast people's plans to join the Fantee army but did not take preventive action, suggesting reluctance or inability to enforce British authority. His private advice to friends, encouraging discreet action to avoid confrontation, further aligns with the claim of preferring discretion over open enforcement. Additionally, his reactive measures, such as ordering the destruction of Attah's house after the fact, underscore a focus on managing appearances rather than exerting real control. These observations from The African Times collectively suggest that Mr. Ussher's actions were more about maintaining appearances than demonstrating genuine authority, thus supporting the claim.

# The British military operations on the West Coast of Africa involved a significant military presence aimed at combating piracy.

The examination of both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles reveals a lack of direct evidence supporting the claim that British military operations on the West Coast of Africa involved a significant military presence specifically aimed at combating piracy. The General History of Africa primarily discusses British military actions in the context of colonial expansion, suppression of the slave trade, and conflicts with African states, emphasizing the enforcement of treaties, punitive expeditions, and warfare to establish control over territories like Nigeria and the Gold Coast. While naval operations and warships are mentioned, they are linked to the suppression of the slave trade rather than piracy, focusing on broader imperial objectives and strategic military use to secure British interests. Similarly, The African Times articles detail a substantial British military presence, including a significant naval force and organized landing parties, but do not explicitly cite combating piracy as the primary objective. Instead, the articles highlight military engagements with local natives, such as shelling the bush, destroying plantations, and burning villages, with an expedition to the Niger River aimed at settling disputes with local chiefs. Despite confirming a significant military presence, the articles do not directly support the claim of operations specifically targeting piracy, marking a notable absence of a direct link to piracy in both sources.

# The British relied on native police forces, under the command of English officers, to maintain order and enforce colonial rule in African territories.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the British reliance on native police forces to maintain order and enforce colonial rule in African territories, albeit with some nuances. The General History of Africa highlights that colonial rule was maintained through a combination of military and civil institutional control, with European powers utilizing indigenous elements in their military establishments. It notes that African troops primarily performed police functions during the inter-war era, often being alienated from their own societies due to deployment in culturally unfamiliar regions. The text describes a 500-strong African police force in the Cape Colony, which was untrained and overbearing, indicating reliance on native forces for maintaining order. However, it does not explicitly confirm that these forces were under the command of English officers, though it implies a hierarchical structure with European oversight. The African Times articles provide more direct support for the claim, mentioning a small British force consisting of eleven native police under an English officer sent to counter a threat near the Sulymah district, aligning with the claim of native police under British command. However, the articles also describe a military operation involving British naval divisions, Marines, and Niger Coast Protectorate troops, without mention of native police, suggesting that British military forces also played a significant role. This indicates a more complex and varied approach to colonial enforcement than the claim suggests, with both sources highlighting the use of native forces but differing in the level of detail regarding command structures and the extent of reliance on native versus British military forces.

# The annexation of territories in the Pacific was a significant point of contention and seen as crucial for the security and prosperity of British possessions in Australasia.

The claim that the annexation of territories in the Pacific was a significant point of contention and seen as crucial for the security and prosperity of British possessions in Australasia is supported by observations from The African Times but not addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook focuses on British imperial activities and territorial disputes in Africa, particularly in Southern and West Africa during the 19th century, emphasizing the discovery of diamonds, territorial conflicts, and British economic interests in African regions. It does not mention the Pacific or Australasia, highlighting a focus on African history and British colonial interests in that region. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide several details supporting the claim, highlighting the excitement and support for annexation within Victoria, with resolutions from municipalities like Ballarat and Horsham. The Inter-Colonial Conference resolutions underscore the detrimental impact of foreign dominion in the Pacific on British interests and the importance of securing territories like New Guinea and the New Hebrides. The articles also mention French agitation for annexation, indicating the competitive nature of colonial expansion in the region. These details align with the claim by illustrating the strategic importance of these territories and the desire to prevent foreign powers from gaining control, perceived as a threat to British security and prosperity in Australasia.

# The rise of nationalism in Australia was accompanied by a desire for self-governance and minimal interference from England, yet it did not diminish loyalty to the British Crown.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" and The African Times provide a nuanced perspective on the rise of nationalism in Australia and its relationship with the British Crown. While the "General History of Africa" does not directly address Australian nationalism, it offers a comparative lens through the lens of African nationalism, which was characterized by a strong desire for self-determination and independence from colonial powers, often rejecting foreign interference entirely. This contrasts with the Australian context, where the desire for self-governance was accompanied by a continued loyalty to the British Crown. The African nationalist movements were largely in opposition to colonial rulers, seeking complete independence, unlike the Australian experience where loyalty to the Crown persisted. The African Times articles support the claim that Australian nationalism was marked by a desire for minimal interference from England while maintaining a strong connection to the British Crown. They highlight that Australia, much like Canada, valued its ties to England and remained loyal, even as nationalism grew due to external pressures and policies from the mother country. This loyalty was evident across various societal levels, indicating that the rise of nationhood in Australia did not equate to a rejection of the British Crown. Together, these observations underscore the unique nature of Australian nationalism, which balanced aspirations for self-governance with enduring allegiance to the British Crown, contrasting with the more separatist tendencies of African nationalism.

# The establishment of a steam sugar mill in Millsburg signifies industrial progress in Liberia.

The claim that the establishment of a steam sugar mill in Millsburg signifies industrial progress in Liberia is supported by observations from The African Times but not mentioned in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles detail the opening of a large steam sugar mill on Mr. Lloyd's estate, costing 3,000 pounds, which represents a significant investment in industrial infrastructure. The presence of the President of the Republic at the opening and his speech highlight the importance of this development as a sign of progress. The articles also describe a broader context of agricultural and industrial growth along the St. Paul's River, with multiple steam sugar mills in operation, including the largest one owned by L. L. Lloyd, Esq. This burgeoning sugar industry, marked by increasing exports of sugar and coffee, illustrates significant industrial and economic advancement for Liberia. In contrast, the General History of Africa does not mention the steam sugar mill or any similar industrial development in Liberia, focusing instead on other social, economic, and political aspects, such as the reopening of Liberia College, the installation of the first telephone, and the influence of foreign investments, particularly in rubber production by Firestone. The absence of information on the steam sugar mill in the textbook highlights a gap in its coverage of industrial progress in Liberia, as it does not provide details that support, refute, or are associated with the claim.

# The potential for increased coffee exports from Liberia to the United States suggests untapped economic opportunities hindered by a lack of financial and technological infrastructure.

The potential for increased coffee exports from Liberia to the United States suggests untapped economic opportunities, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook notes that Liberian coffee faced a drastic price drop from 1898 due to competition with better-prepared Brazilian coffee, indicating untapped opportunities hindered by financial and technological limitations. The Liberian government's financial struggles, including bankruptcy and extensive borrowing, underscore the lack of financial infrastructure, while difficulties in collecting customs dues and preventing smuggling point to technological shortcomings. Although the textbook does not specifically mention the United States as a target market, The African Times articles provide further context by reporting that Hon. E. J. Barclay, Secretary of State of Liberia, acknowledged the potential to significantly expand coffee trade, potentially a hundredfold. He cited challenges such as the infancy of coffee culture, absence of banks, and limited machinery, aligning with the claim of infrastructural constraints. The articles also note that 1,000 lbs. of coffee were ready for shipment to the United States from the Methodist Mission, illustrating existing but limited trade. Together, these sources support the notion of untapped economic opportunities for Liberian coffee exports, hindered by financial and technological infrastructure challenges, with a specific connection to the U.S. market highlighted by The African Times.

# The expansion of Liberia was seen as a means to increase the population, wealth, and political strength of the republic.

The expansion of Liberia was perceived as a strategic move to bolster the republic's population, wealth, and political strength, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the significant territorial expansion undertaken by the Americo-Liberians to acquire land for farming, trade, and nation-building, aligning with the goal of increasing wealth and political power. This expansion included the settlement of over 18,000 New World Africans and 5,000 Recaptives, supporting the notion of population growth. However, it also notes challenges such as opposition from local chiefs and the need to assert authority over new territories, which complicates the narrative of straightforward growth. The expansion led to increased ethnic diversity and tensions, similar to Ethiopia's experience, indicating that the process was not solely beneficial. Meanwhile, The African Times articles detail the annexation of the interior kingdom of Medina and the Bopora and Barline districts, adding about 500,000 people to the population and forming the richest and most populous county in the state. This expansion is expected to enhance commerce by opening new markets for European and American goods and tapping into rich resources like gold, iron, and cotton. The articles also emphasize the potential for increased political strength and international influence, with foreign missionary boards invited to aid in Africa's redemption. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that supports the claim while acknowledging the complexities and challenges of Liberia's expansion efforts.

# Despite efforts to suppress it, the slave trade was still a lucrative and persistent enterprise, necessitating increased international intervention and enforcement.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that, despite efforts to suppress it, the slave trade remained a lucrative and persistent enterprise, necessitating increased international intervention and enforcement. The textbook highlights the inadequacy of treaties like the Hamerton Treaty in curtailing the demand for slaves, pointing out that economic incentives allowed the trade to thrive. It describes how European merchants, facing lower profit margins, resorted to paying retainers in slaves, thereby intensifying the trade. The persistence of the trade is further evidenced by continued French slaving expeditions and American evasion of serious suppression commitments. The text also notes the economic motivations behind the trade, such as the demand for labor in plantation economies and the profitability that led to its expansion into Africa's interior. European weapons and conquest states reliant on the trade further sustained it. Meanwhile, The African Times articles report that 14,000 negroes were ready to be embarked and sold on the African coast, illustrating the trade's scale and persistence. The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Sir J. Crampton emphasize the need for increased vigilance by British cruisers, while Earl Russell's circular note suggests treating the slave trade as piracy, reflecting the need for stronger international measures. Ongoing negotiations with the Khedive of Egypt and reports of active trade from Whydah to Portuguese islands underscore the trade's persistence and the necessity for enhanced international intervention. Together, these sources illustrate the economic drivers, international complexities, and local dynamics that sustained the slave trade, despite suppression efforts.

# The suppression of the slave trade required international cooperation and negotiation, involving multiple countries and treaties.

The suppression of the slave trade required extensive international cooperation and negotiation, involving multiple countries and treaties, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides substantial evidence of this claim by detailing various bilateral treaties, such as the Anglo-Portuguese treaty of 1842 and the 1826 suppression treaty with Brazil, which enforced measures like the right to search slave ships and established mixed commissions to adjudicate on captured vessels. These efforts highlight the collaborative actions between nations like Britain, France, and the USA, as well as the involvement of Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden in reciprocal suppression agreements. The narrative also underscores the diplomatic efforts and coercive policies of France and Britain, despite challenges posed by national sovereignty concerns and some states' reluctance to fully commit to abolitionist measures. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the necessity of international collaboration, citing the involvement of the British and Spanish governments, as well as communications between their officials, to enhance vigilance against the slave trade. The articles also mention the Select Committee on the East African slave trade's recommendation to involve Germany, France, America, and Portugal, and to negotiate with the Persian Government. The ratification of the Final Act of the Brussels Conference further illustrates a multilateral approach, although the French government's reservations highlight the difficulties in achieving unanimous international agreement. Together, these sources illustrate the complex web of international negotiations and treaties essential to the efforts to suppress the slave trade.

# The British efforts to suppress the East African slave trade were inconsistent and insufficient, relying on treaties with countries that had conflicting interests.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that British efforts to suppress the East African slave trade were inconsistent and insufficient, primarily due to reliance on treaties with countries that had conflicting interests. The textbook highlights the challenges faced by the British in enforcing treaties like the Hamerton Treaty of 1845, which aimed to restrict the slave trade but was hampered by the vast extent of the sultan's empire and his reluctance to end the trade. Similarly, the enforcement of the 1873 decree prohibiting slave trade by sea proved difficult, as both the sultan and the British struggled to implement it effectively. The thriving slave trade, fueled by the expanding plantation economy in Zanzibar and Pemba, which depended on slave labor, and the ability of traders to smuggle slaves despite British naval patrols, further underscores the insufficiency of British efforts. The African Times articles echo these sentiments, noting that for over thirty-four years, Britain relied on treaties with rulers who were either unwilling or unable to enforce them, aligning with the claim of conflicting interests. The articles also highlight the inconsistency in British naval deployment, with minimal efforts in the Red Sea compared to the opposite coast, where a squadron of fifteen vessels was used. Additionally, the continued flourishing of the slave trade between Madagascar and Mozambique, partly under the French flag, indicates the ineffectiveness of these treaties. Both sources illustrate the complexities and limitations of British actions, reinforcing the notion of inadequate and inconsistent measures in suppressing the East African slave trade.

# The expansion of cotton cultivation in Africa during the 19th century indicates a shift towards agricultural development and increased economic engagement with European markets.

The expansion of cotton cultivation in Africa during the 19th century is indicative of a shift towards agricultural development and increased economic engagement with European markets, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the transition from the slave trade to export agriculture, including cotton, marking a significant economic change that allowed rural populations to participate in income generation, thus fostering agricultural development. It underscores the integration of Africa's economy into the capitalist world-economy, despite the lack of technological advancement in production methods. The textbook also notes the cultivation of cash crops like cotton in regions such as Sudan and Uganda, which became primary income sources for African states, while cautioning against the vulnerabilities of monocrop economies and the exploitative nature of this economic integration. Complementing this, The African Times articles report on the expansion of cotton cultivation "on a far enlarged scale," with expectations of doubling cotton consignments to England, reflecting increased agricultural activity and direct economic ties with European markets. Although the articles do not delve into the broader agricultural development across Africa, they provide context on other economic activities and challenges, such as the impact of the American war on revenue and efforts to suppress the slave trade, offering a glimpse into the complex economic environment of the period. Together, these sources support the claim of increased economic engagement with European markets through cotton cultivation, while also highlighting the challenges and exploitative aspects of this integration.

# The British administration in South Africa was perceived as lacking understanding of local conditions and logistics.

The perception that the British administration in South Africa lacked understanding of local conditions and logistics is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights several instances where the British failed to grasp the complexities of local customs and socio-political dynamics. For example, their imposition of a foreign legal system on the Xhosa, without respecting indigenous legal customs, led to significant grievances and resistance. White magistrates, unfamiliar with both Cape Laws and Xhosa legal systems, often made arbitrary decisions, exacerbating tensions. Additionally, the British administration's disregard for Boer land claims and exclusion of Boers from political participation in Natal further exemplifies their disconnect from local realities. Their underestimation of the financial and logistical challenges of expansionist policies resulted in costly wars and the eventual abandonment of Smith's expansionist policy. Attempts to federate South African states without considering local sentiments and the complex socio-political landscape also ended in repeated failures. Similarly, The African Times articles underscore this disconnect, citing a "ludicrous inquiry" by military authorities about a chaplain's ability to conduct services in two distant locations on the same day, revealing a lack of logistical awareness. Captain Lendy's precarious position along the frontier, with insufficient forces to manage the turbulent situation, and the slow response of the Colonial Government to disturbances further illustrate the administration's shortcomings. The articles also criticize the British for allowing small wars to continue, indirectly supporting slavery, which indicates a lack of understanding or concern for local socio-political dynamics. Together, these observations paint a consistent picture of the British administration's failure to engage with the realities on the ground in South Africa.

# The use of colonial troops from other parts of the British Empire in African conflicts.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced understanding of the use of colonial troops from different parts of the British Empire in African conflicts. The General History of Africa highlights the significant role of African troops in the Allied successes during World War I, noting their deployment to reinforce European armies on the Western and Middle Eastern fronts. This underscores the broader practice of utilizing colonial troops beyond their native regions, although the text does not specifically address the use of non-African colonial troops in African conflicts. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim by detailing the deployment of the 2nd Battalion West India Regiment, composed of Caribbean soldiers, to Sierra Leone and the Gambia River. These articles describe their involvement in expeditions against Chief Karimo in Tambi and their coordination with local forces like the Sierra Leone Frontier Police and native levies, illustrating the British Empire's strategy of integrating colonial and local forces to manage conflicts. Together, these sources provide evidence of the British Empire's reliance on colonial troops from various regions to address conflicts in Africa, with the textbook focusing on African troops' roles in global conflicts and the articles highlighting the use of non-African colonial troops within Africa.

# The trade of palm oil and palm kernels was a significant economic activity in West Africa, indicating the region's reliance on these commodities for trade.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the trade of palm oil and palm kernels was a significant economic activity in West Africa, indicating the region's reliance on these commodities for trade. The textbook highlights the transition from the slave trade to palm oil as a dominant factor in Dahomey's export economy, reflecting a broader shift in the Mono-Niger region. It notes the dramatic expansion of palm oil trade, with imports into Britain rising significantly from 1814 to 1870, and France also importing substantial quantities. The text emphasizes that the palm oil industry required more manpower than the slave trade, underscoring its economic importance, and describes how this shift strengthened private merchants and increased the importance of northern savanna trade. Although the palm oil trade initially co-existed with the slave trade, suggesting a gradual transition, the textbook underscores the economic role of palm oil and palm kernels in West Africa's trade. Complementing this, The African Times articles consistently report on the sales and prices of palm oil and palm kernels, indicating their market importance. Frequent mentions of palm oil sales, with varying prices and quantities such as 700 tons sold in one week and 500 tons in another, highlight its steady demand. Similarly, palm kernels are regularly reported, with specific quantities and prices, such as 1,420 mats and 150 tons sold at specified rates. While the articles do not explicitly state the economic reliance of West Africa on these commodities, the regularity and detail of the reports imply their economic significance, aligning with the claim of their importance in West African trade. Together, these sources illustrate the critical role of palm oil and palm kernels in the region's economic landscape.

# The presence of African commodities in European markets highlights the integration of African economies into global trade networks.

The integration of African economies into global trade networks is vividly illustrated by the presence of African commodities in European markets, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides substantial evidence of this integration, highlighting the transition from the slave trade to export agriculture, which facilitated the connection of Africa's external and internal economies to the capitalist world-economy. Key commodities such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, and rubber became significant exports, linking African economies to European markets. The role of European commercial firms in this process is emphasized, though the exploitative nature of these relationships and the lack of technological advancement in Africa's means of production posed challenges to competing with industrialized European economies. Similarly, The African Times articles detail the active trade of African commodities like ginger, palm kernels, palm oil, cotton, coffee, gum, ebony, and copra in European markets, including Liverpool. The consistent reporting of sales, prices, and market conditions for these commodities underscores their significance in international trade. African coffee and cocoa are noted alongside other origins, and specific price points and quantities for African palm oil and kernels reflect their demand and integration into the global market. The mention of commodities like India-rubber and ground nuts further supports this integration, illustrating the active participation of African economies in global trade networks through the export of diverse commodities. Together, these observations from both sources provide a nuanced perspective on the integration of African economies into global trade, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges faced in this process.

# The trade in African commodities like palm oil and cotton was subject to international market forces, impacting local economies and trade practices.

The trade in African commodities like palm oil and cotton was significantly influenced by international market forces, impacting local economies and trade practices, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the transition from the slave trade to export agriculture, such as palm oil and cotton, which integrated African economies into the capitalist world-economy. This shift led to a redistribution of income from the ruling elite to ordinary people, particularly in rural areas, as they could produce these commodities. However, the lack of technological advancements left African economies unable to compete with industrialized Europe, and the dominance of small, unspecialized producers in the export sector meant they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, providing some protection from adverse economic conditions. The textbook also notes the monocrop dependencies that made African states sensitive to international trade conditions and the exploitative nature of trade practices, such as unequal exchange, facilitated by European commercial firms. The African Times articles further support the claim by detailing fluctuations in prices and market conditions, such as the steady market for palm oil with regional price variations and the dull market for cotton with slightly reduced prices, indicating the influence of international demand and pricing dynamics. The mention of holidays affecting cotton sales underscores the impact of international trading schedules on local trade practices. However, the articles do not explicitly address the broader economic impact on local economies, an omission that contrasts with the textbook's emphasis on the socio-economic consequences of global market dynamics on African commodity trade. Together, these sources illustrate the profound influence of international market forces on African trade and its socio-economic ramifications.

# The demand for palm oil in Africa led to increased prices, indicating its economic importance in the region.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the economic importance of palm oil in Africa, albeit from different perspectives. The General History of Africa highlights the transition from the slave trade to palm oil as a pivotal economic shift in regions like Dahomey, where palm oil became a dominant export, necessitating more manpower and indicating its rising economic significance. This transition also involved structural changes in production and income redistribution, although the text does not explicitly mention increased prices for palm oil. In contrast, The African Times provides direct evidence of the demand for palm oil leading to increased prices, with reports of a "good demand" and "brisk demand" resulting in price advances of 5s. to 10s., and a notable increase of 20s. to 25s. in Lagos due to scarcity. These articles highlight the direct correlation between demand and price increases, underscoring palm oil's economic significance. While the textbook focuses on the broader economic shifts and structural changes, the news articles emphasize the immediate market dynamics, together painting a comprehensive picture of palm oil's economic role in the region.

# The involvement of the British military in local African affairs was often necessary to enforce colonial rule and maintain order.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that British military involvement in local African affairs was often necessary to enforce colonial rule and maintain order. The General History of Africa highlights instances where the British military was used to suppress resistance and enforce treaties, such as the punitive expedition against Benin in 1897 and the arrest of Jaja of Opobo in 1887, indicating that military intervention was indeed employed to maintain colonial control. The establishment of standing armies and the use of African troops for police functions during the inter-war period further underscore the reliance on military force. However, the text also emphasizes the use of indirect rule and the involvement of local chiefs, suggesting that diplomatic and administrative measures were significant in enforcing colonial rule. The African Times articles support the claim by detailing instances where British troops were deployed to enforce colonial legal and administrative actions, such as aiding in the payment of a fine imposed on the King of Cape Coast and establishing military rule in Stellaland to address local unrest. These articles illustrate the military's role in asserting British authority and managing potential conflicts, though they also acknowledge the complexities and challenges of such interventions, as seen in Zululand, where military involvement was not always effective or welcomed. Together, these sources suggest that while military involvement was a crucial component of British colonial strategy, it was not the sole method employed to maintain order.

---

# The British response to local threats involved deploying military personnel to reinforce and protect their trading operations.

The claim that the British response to local threats involved deploying military personnel to reinforce and protect their trading operations is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides numerous examples of the British using military force to secure their interests, such as the punitive expedition against Benin in 1897 and the use of gunboats in the Niger Delta to enforce treaties and collect trade debts. The involvement of the British Admiralty in humanitarian policing and the deployment of naval squadrons to protect legitimate trade further illustrate the military's role in safeguarding British economic interests. The establishment of the West African Frontier Force and the conquest of territories like the Sokoto sultanate underscore the military's involvement in expanding and securing British influence. Similarly, The African Times reports that Her Majesty's ship Alecto was dispatched to Opobo in response to a threatened attack by adherents of the deposed King Ja Ja, with sailors and marines deployed to reinforce traders, demonstrating a military response to protect British trading interests. However, the articles also highlight that the British response to local threats sometimes involved political maneuvering, as seen in the political and economic tensions in Lagos and the call for the return of ex-Governor Glover. This suggests that while military deployment was a common strategy, it was part of a broader approach that included political actions to address local threats.

# Colonial administrators often dismissed the requests and needs of African leaders, reflecting a broader pattern of colonial disregard for local governance.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that colonial administrators often dismissed the requests and needs of African leaders, reflecting a broader pattern of colonial disregard for local governance. The textbook highlights how colonial powers systematically weakened indigenous systems by deposing traditional rulers, appointing unqualified individuals as chiefs, and using traditional leaders merely as administrative tools rather than genuine partners. This manipulation led to a loss of prestige and respect for traditional rulers among their subjects. The authoritarian and paternalistic nature of the colonial system meant that African interests were not genuinely prioritized, as seen in the concept of 'native paramountcy,' which was more about respecting rather than prioritizing African interests. The colonial regimes often ignored the aspirations of both traditional and new educated elites, fostering conflict between them and maintaining control by exploiting divisions. Additionally, the imposition of European-planned taxes and disregard for African cultural practices further exemplified the colonial disregard for local governance. These themes are echoed in The African Times articles, where specific incidents illustrate this broader pattern. Colonel Conran's refusal to provide ammunition to King Ajeman, despite community backing, and his derogatory remarks and threats against the king, highlight a lack of respect for local authority. Similarly, Inspector-General Mitchell's actions in Jebu Ode, where he forcibly summoned the Awujale and used force against the local population, demonstrate a disregard for local customs and authority. These incidents underscore the colonial attitude of undermining and dismissing African leadership and governance, aligning with the broader observations from the textbook.

# The British colonial system in Africa was criticized for its inefficiency and lack of accountability in managing collected funds and providing public services.

The British colonial system in Africa faced significant criticism for its inefficiency and lack of accountability in managing collected funds and providing public services, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights that government expenditure was notably low, with only 4% of total revenue being spent in Nigeria and the French territories, and 7% in Ghana during the mid-1930s, indicating inefficiency in resource allocation. It also points out the uneven distribution of educational facilities, with most post-primary institutions concentrated in urban centers, reflecting a lack of accountability in providing equitable public services. Furthermore, the colonial powers' lack of prioritization for the development of Africans underscores the inefficiency and lack of accountability. However, the textbook does not explicitly address the management of collected funds. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific examples of financial mismanagement, such as the failure to utilize the 5,000 pounds collected annually from Winnebah to improve local conditions, resulting in a lack of essential services like a Colonial school, a doctor, and a court of justice. The articles also criticize British officials for negligence and mismanagement, exemplified by incidents like the gunpowder robbery due to the Collector's carelessness and the Harbour Master's oversight. Additionally, the low salaries of local officers, placing them in "very tempting positions," suggest systemic issues in financial management and accountability. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the inefficiency and lack of accountability in the British colonial system, particularly in public service provision and financial management.

# The presence of British naval ships on the West Coast of Africa suggests a strategic interest in controlling maritime routes and regional trade.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the presence of British naval ships on the West Coast of Africa suggests a strategic interest in controlling maritime routes and regional trade. The General History of Africa provides detailed accounts of British naval actions, such as the annexation of Lagos in 1861 and operations against Porto Novo, which were aimed at controlling trade routes and safeguarding British commercial interests. The stationing of a naval squadron at Fernando Po in 1827 and the use of gunboat diplomacy to secure favorable conditions for British traders further underscore this strategic interest. Additionally, the British efforts to abolish the slave trade and promote 'legitimate trade' through treaties and interventions that weakened local rulers' power highlight a broader strategy to dominate regional trade. Complementing this, The African Times articles mention British naval ships like the Boxer, Mallard, and Seagull operating in the region, with the Sirius commissioned for service on the West Coast of Africa and the Cape of Good Hope, indicating a significant naval presence. While the articles do not explicitly state the strategic objectives of controlling maritime routes or regional trade, the focus on naval movements and ship trials suggests operational readiness and capability, indirectly supporting the claim. Furthermore, complaints about customs examiners damaging goods from England emphasize the importance of trade, implying a British interest in maintaining control over trade activities in the area. Together, these observations illustrate a concerted British effort to exert influence over maritime routes and regional trade in West Africa during the 19th century.

# The British military efforts in Africa were often met with resistance and were not always successful in achieving their objectives, such as capturing local leaders or restoring peace.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that British military efforts in Africa were often met with resistance and were not always successful in achieving their objectives, such as capturing local leaders or restoring peace. The textbook highlights various instances of African resistance to British colonial rule, such as the Nandi in Kenya, who resisted British imperialism and the construction of the railway for over seven years until their leader was treacherously murdered. Similarly, the Mazrui family on the Kenyan coast resisted British interference, leading to prolonged conflict, and the British had to employ violence and mercenaries to impose their authority in Kenya. The challenges in capturing local leaders are exemplified by King Jaja of Opobo, who was tricked rather than defeated in open battle. These examples suggest that British military objectives were not easily achieved and were met with considerable resistance. The African Times articles further illustrate these challenges, describing how British forces struggled to capture Geraldo, who continued his activities despite the presence of British cruisers, and how the King of Aquamboe impeded navigation and trade along the Volta River, indicating a failure to restore peace and commerce. Additionally, a military expedition faced spirited resistance at Sabogrega, resulting in casualties and necessitating a retreat and reorganization. While the articles focus on specific incidents, they underscore the resistance and difficulties faced by British forces, aligning with the broader observations from the textbook. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view of the resistance and challenges encountered by the British military in Africa.

# The use of steam launches and steamers highlights the technological advancements in transportation that facilitated European involvement in Africa during this period.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the role of technological advancements in transportation, particularly steam-powered vessels, in facilitating European involvement in Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines, replacing slave ships, and the role of steamships in enhancing contacts between Brazil and the west coast of Africa, marking a significant technological leap. It also discusses the construction of railways in South Africa, driven by the discovery of gold and diamonds, further emphasizing advanced transportation's role in European activities. However, it does not specifically mention steam launches or steamers in this context. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically highlight the use of steam launches and steamers, such as the African Royal Mail steamers, Africa and Benin, which connected Europe with the West Coast of Africa. The steamer Benin's role in transporting government troops, passengers, and a large steam launch underscores the strategic and logistical importance of steam-powered transportation in military and exploratory endeavors. While the articles focus on the practical applications of these technologies, they do not delve into the broader implications of these advancements on European involvement. Together, these sources illustrate how steam-powered transportation enabled more efficient movement of people, goods, and military resources, thereby facilitating European influence and activities in Africa.

# The British expeditionary force faced logistical challenges due to the difficult terrain and scarcity of water in the Benin region.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the logistical challenges faced by the British expeditionary force in the Benin region. The textbook primarily focuses on the military and political aspects of the British conquest of Benin, such as the resistance encountered, the use of treaties, and the eventual defeat and looting of Benin City. It highlights the broader challenges faced by West African states, like the technical superiority of European weapons and the lack of unified resistance, but does not specifically mention logistical difficulties related to terrain or water scarcity faced by the British forces. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim of logistical challenges, with Lieut. Robertson's account emphasizing the "nature of the country" and "scarcity of water" as significant obstacles. The expedition involved navigating rivers, creeks, and overland marches, indicating challenging terrain, and was further complicated by limited resources. However, Lieutenant Lefroy's article, focusing on a different expedition related to the Niger River, does not address these specific challenges, suggesting that the logistical difficulties were particular to the Benin expedition rather than a general issue for all British operations in the region.

---

# The presence of doctors and other professionals among the passengers may indicate efforts to establish or maintain colonial infrastructure and services in Africa.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view that supports the claim regarding the presence of doctors and other professionals as part of efforts to establish or maintain colonial infrastructure and services in Africa. The textbook highlights the role of medical professionals, including mission doctors and medical missionaries, in providing healthcare services primarily for European soldiers, administrators, and missionaries, with some care extended to African troops and workers. It details the establishment of hospitals and dispensaries in regions like Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and the involvement of medical auxiliaries and local self-help projects, indicating efforts to build healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, the text mentions the creation of educational institutions and the engagement of professionals like Belgian officers and foreign nationals in various development projects, supporting the claim of establishing colonial infrastructure. However, it also emphasizes the inadequacy and uneven distribution of these services, primarily benefiting Europeans, which contrasts with the claim's implication of a more comprehensive effort. Meanwhile, The African Times articles list numerous individuals, including doctors, traveling to African destinations such as Sierra Leone, Accra, and Lagos, with mentions of medical staff on transport vessels like the Sprite and the hospital ship Victor Emmanuel, suggesting organized medical support. While the articles do not explicitly state the purpose of these professionals' travel, the presence of medical professionals aligns with the claim, though they do not provide explicit evidence of broader colonial infrastructure efforts beyond medical services. Together, these sources offer a nuanced view that aligns with the claim but also highlights the limitations and biases in the colonial infrastructure efforts.

# The British administration in the Niger Protectorate utilized local African crew members for their official vessels, indicating a reliance on indigenous labor for colonial operations.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about the British administration in the Niger Protectorate utilizing local African crew members for their official vessels. While it discusses the broader use of indigenous personnel and institutions in colonial administration, particularly through indirect rule and the role of local chiefs, it does not mention the employment of local African crew members on British vessels. The text highlights the reliance on indigenous labor for various colonial operations, such as forced labor for infrastructure projects and recruitment into armies and police forces, but it does not specifically address the use of local crew members on official vessels. In contrast, The African Times news articles support the claim that the British administration in the Niger Protectorate utilized local African crew members for their official vessels. An article about "The Niger Protectorate's New Yacht" mentions that the crew of the Ivy, the new official yacht of Sir Claude Macdonald, Administrator of the Niger Protectorate, were "mostly Natives," indicating a reliance on indigenous labor for the operation of colonial vessels. However, the articles do not provide further context or details about the broader use of indigenous labor in other colonial operations beyond the crew of the yacht. This lack of additional information on the extent of indigenous labor utilization in other areas of colonial administration presents a difference from the broader implications of the claim.

# The deployment of British officers and non-commissioned officers to the Niger suggests a strategic military interest in the region by the British Empire.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the British Empire's strategic military interest in the Niger region. The textbook details the British use of military conquest as a primary method of establishing control in Northern Nigeria, with the Royal Niger Company (RNC) and the British government playing significant roles. The deployment of British officers and non-commissioned officers, evidenced by the RNC's military campaigns against Nupe and Ilorin, indicates a strategic interest in securing the region against French and German encroachments. The establishment of the West African Frontier Force and campaigns against various emirates further underscore the British military focus, highlighting efforts to halt French expansion towards the lower Niger and into the Asante hinterland. These details align with the claim of a strategic interest. Meanwhile, The African Times articles support this claim by noting the deployment of over forty officers and non-commissioned officers, including high-ranking personnel, which suggests a significant military presence. The presence of Maxim guns, albeit without ammunition, further indicates a potential military focus. However, the articles also mention the reduction of the naval squadron on the West Coast of Africa, with Mr. Gladstone considering its entire withdrawal, contrasting with the notion of a heightened strategic military interest. This reduction could imply a shift in priorities or a reevaluation of military commitments in the region. Thus, while the deployment to the Niger suggests some level of military interest, the broader context of naval reduction complicates the narrative of a clear strategic focus.

# The decline in palm oil prices and its impact on African economies and trade.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the decline in palm oil prices and its impact on African economies and trade, though they approach the topic from different angles. The textbook highlights the historical significance of palm oil as a major export product in West Africa, particularly in the Niger delta, noting its expansion during the nineteenth century and subsequent decline by the end of the century. This suggests a decrease in palm oil prices or demand, potentially affecting economies reliant on this trade. The text also mentions the shift from the slave trade to palm oil and other cash crops, indicating changes in economic structures that could be influenced by palm oil price fluctuations. However, it lacks a detailed analysis of the direct economic consequences of such a decline. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the contemporary market conditions, describing a depressed palm oil market with low prices causing concern among merchants and shippers. They highlight an excess of supply over demand, leading to calls for reduced purchase prices from native producers to restore profit margins, and note fluctuations in prices and stock levels affecting trade dynamics. Despite this, the articles do not explicitly address the broader economic impact on African economies, concentrating more on market specifics. Together, these sources provide evidence of declining palm oil prices and their influence on trade, but neither directly addresses the wider economic implications for African economies.

# The fluctuation in palm oil prices indicating a volatile market.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide contrasting perspectives on the claim regarding the fluctuation in palm oil prices indicating a volatile market. The General History of Africa offers insights into the palm oil trade's historical context, focusing on the transition from the slave trade to palm oil as a dominant export in regions like Dahomey, the Niger delta, and the Gold Coast. It highlights the economic shift and increased demand for labor to support palm oil production, as well as the expansion of exports to Europe. However, it does not directly address price fluctuations or market volatility, indicating a gap in the discussion of the dynamics of palm oil pricing. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide detailed evidence supporting the claim of a volatile palm oil market, citing multiple instances of price changes. For example, in September, prices fell by 20s. per ton but later rallied, and in May, Bonny oil prices dropped to £17 5s. before recovering by the end of June. The articles also note a rally in March, with prices advancing by upwards of 40s. per ton, only to lose some gains by month's end, and significant price increases in September and October, with palm oil becoming £2 to £3 a ton dearer by October's end. These fluctuations, along with varying import and delivery figures affecting stock levels, underscore the market's volatility, aligning with the notion of a volatile palm oil market. Thus, while the textbook provides context on the trade's significance and growth, The African Times offers concrete evidence of market instability, supporting the claim of price volatility.

# The decline in palm kernel prices suggesting a potential oversupply or reduced demand.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide different perspectives on the economic conditions surrounding palm products, particularly palm kernels. The General History of Africa does not directly address the decline in palm kernel prices or suggest a potential oversupply or reduced demand. Instead, it discusses falling prices for palm products in the context of economic hardship during the early stages of World War I, linked to the exclusion of German traders and the resulting economic depression, rather than a specific decline in palm kernel prices. The text also covers the transition from the slave trade to palm oil production in the Gold Coast, but again, without specific mention of palm kernel prices. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide evidence supporting the claim of a decline in palm kernel prices, suggesting a potential oversupply or reduced demand. Reports from November 14, March 17, and September 6 describe the market as "flat," "dull and drooping," and note consistent price declines, with reductions of "15s. to 20s. per ton" and a further "2s. 6d. decline on the week." These reports of declining prices and limited business activity across different months align with the claim of a potential oversupply or reduced demand, although the articles do not explicitly state the reasons for the price decline. Together, these sources highlight a difference in focus, with the textbook providing historical context and the news articles offering current market observations.

# The African rubber market experiencing fluctuations in demand and prices.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the African rubber market has experienced fluctuations in demand and prices. The General History of Africa highlights several historical instances of such fluctuations, noting that natural rubber had only momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s and that the more substantial rubber industry in East and Central Africa declined after an international price crisis in 1912-13. This indicates a pattern of fluctuating demand and prices, as evidenced by the decline following the crisis. Additionally, the text mentions that the commercial prosperity from rubber trade in Bailundu, Angola, ended with a drop in prices between 1899 and 1902, further supporting the claim. The limited economic integration of Firestone's rubber production in Liberia also suggests instability in the market's impact. Complementing these historical insights, The African Times articles provide contemporary examples of market fluctuations, describing periods of both poor and steady demand for African rubber. For instance, on April 14, the market experienced poor demand with minimal business, whereas on September 6, there was good demand at steady prices, with significant sales. The articles also note price variations, such as Grand Bassam rubber being sold at different prices over time, from 1s. 2d. to 1s. 5¼d. per lb. While these articles focus on specific transactions and timeframes, they align with the broader historical trends of fluctuating demand and prices in the African rubber market.

# The trade of African gum and its role in international markets.

The examination of both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveals a limited focus on the trade of African gum and its role in international markets. The textbook does not specifically address gum as a significant trade item, instead concentrating on commodities like cloves, ivory, slaves, palm oil, and rubber, and discussing the economic activities in regions such as East Africa, the Maghrib, West Africa, and Central Africa. This suggests that gum was not a major focus or a significant factor in the international markets during the periods covered. Similarly, The African Times articles provide limited information, mentioning gum only in the context of business transactions involving Sierra Leone Copal and Brazilian gum, with an emphasis on prices and quantities rather than the broader international significance. Both sources lack detailed insights into the impact or trends of African gum trade in global commerce, indicating that the claim regarding its importance in international markets is not substantiated by the available information.

# The presence of British ships indicating ongoing British interest and involvement in the region.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of ongoing British interest and involvement in the region, as indicated by the presence of British ships. The General History of Africa provides detailed evidence of this involvement, highlighting the stationing of a British naval squadron at Fernando Po in 1827, the use of British gunboats to enforce treaties and intervene in local politics, and the British anti-slave trade squadron's bombardment of Lagos in 1851. These actions demonstrate a significant and active British naval presence, further underscored by the establishment of Courts of Equity under British control and the involvement of British consuls and naval officers in local affairs. These elements illustrate that British ships were instrumental in enforcing British policies and interests, although the text acknowledges that other factors, such as treaties, trade, and missionary activities, also played significant roles in British involvement. Meanwhile, The African Times articles mention British ships like the screw-steamer Retriever and the Rainbow, indicating a maritime presence, and suggest British interest through expectations of governmental actions, such as cleansing the Agloi Creek. However, the articles lack explicit details about the nature or extent of British involvement, and one article focuses on Portuguese navigational changes, which does not relate to British interest. Together, these sources provide a nuanced understanding of British involvement, showing both the presence and influence of British ships while acknowledging other contributing factors to British interest in the region.

# The dense jungles of the palm oil region were largely unexplored and contained untapped natural resources.

The claim that the dense jungles of the palm oil region were largely unexplored and contained untapped natural resources is addressed with differing perspectives in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the extensive involvement of companies like Lever Brothers in the palm oil industry, indicating that the region was not entirely unexplored or untapped. Lever Brothers had significant operations in the Belgian Congo and expanded their oil plantation empire across West Africa, including Gabon, Middle Congo, Nigeria, and Cameroon. This suggests active exploitation by European companies, contradicting the notion of the regions being largely unexplored. The focus on monoculture and cash crops like palm oil further implies that these resources were being tapped, albeit in a manner that left the economies vulnerable. However, the textbook does not explicitly discuss the exploration status of the jungles themselves, leaving room for the possibility that certain areas might have remained less explored. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by describing the palm oil region as only "sampled," with "enormous tracts of dense jungle never trodden by man," where valuable produce ripens and falls unseen. This aligns with the idea of unexplored jungles and untapped resources. The articles also highlight potential development efforts, such as improving water communication and navigation, indicating an interest in accessing these resources. Overall, while the textbook suggests active exploitation, the news articles emphasize the unexplored and resource-rich nature of the jungles, presenting a nuanced view of the claim.

# The development of infrastructure, such as roads and railways, in British West African colonies could significantly enhance trade and economic growth.

The development of infrastructure, such as roads and railways, in British West African colonies presents a complex picture regarding its impact on trade and economic growth, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights that colonial administrations prioritized the construction of railways, roads, and telegraph lines primarily to facilitate the evacuation of exports, connecting mineral-rich and cash crop areas to the coast. This infrastructure reduced transport costs and replaced human porterage with machinery, increasing profit margins and encouraging the expansion of the cash sector. However, the benefits were largely skewed towards commercial firms and European settlers, with African producers rarely benefiting, and the infrastructure primarily serving colonial interests. The infrastructure was not comprehensive, leading to economic disparities within colonies, and was not primarily aimed at fostering local economic growth. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by discussing the potential for infrastructure to significantly enhance trade and economic growth. They emphasize the need for roads to facilitate increased commerce and highlight the potential impact of railroads, such as the projected line at Cape Coast Town, on trade and regional power dynamics. The articles also stress the importance of utilizing waterways for navigation. While they focus on potential benefits and recommendations, they lack specific evidence of economic growth resulting from these developments. Together, these observations reveal a nuanced perspective that both aligns with and challenges the claim, underscoring the complexity of colonial infrastructure's impact on economic growth in British West Africa.

# The Wesleyan Missionary Society played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in Africa.

The Wesleyan Missionary Society (WMS) played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in Africa, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details the WMS's early presence in West Africa, being one of the three missionary societies operating by 1800 and expanding to over fifteen by 1840. It highlights the establishment of numerous educational institutions, including four girls' schools, twenty boys' schools, and the Wesleyan High School, now Mfantsipim School, in the Gold Coast by 1876. The WMS's activities extended to Southern Africa, entering the Cape in 1799 and reaching Natal and the Transvaal by 1816, contributing significantly to the spread of Christianity and Western education. Complementing this, The African Times articles emphasize the Society's success in South Africa, noting over 5,000 converts in the Cape Colony and Kaffraria within six months, underscoring its substantial impact on local religious conversion. The articles also mention an upcoming anniversary meeting with participation from various church ministers, indicating the Society's active engagement and collaboration in promoting Christianity. While the articles focus on South Africa, they do not detail activities in other regions like Natal, which could interest historians studying the Society's broader impact. Together, these sources illustrate the WMS's significant influence and efforts in spreading Christianity across Africa.

# The presence of European missionaries was seen as a civilizing influence by some African communities, reflecting a complex interaction between local traditions and foreign religious practices.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the presence of European missionaries was seen as a civilizing influence by some African communities, reflecting a complex interaction between local traditions and foreign religious practices. The textbook highlights that missionaries were instrumental in creating a class of educated Africans who often accepted the cultural superiority of Europeans, associating colonialism with Christianity and civilization. This acceptance was partly due to the perceived superiority of European power and technology. African rulers sometimes welcomed missionaries to access European education and technical skills, which they saw as beneficial for modernization efforts, such as military reorganization and judicial reforms. Missionaries also introduced a money economy and commercial crops, integrating European economic practices into African societies. However, the textbook acknowledges the negative impact on African culture, as missionaries often sought to eradicate traditional practices, leading to a disintegration of cultural identity. This complex interaction is further illustrated by syncretism, where traditional beliefs blended with Christian practices. Similarly, The African Times articles portray the appointment of Rev. George Nicol, an African clergyman, positively, with hopes for spreading Christian civilization, indicating an acceptance of foreign religious practices as a civilizing influence. The articles also describe a desire for European missionaries in places like Little Popo and Ahgwey, where local leaders, including the Caboceer, showed willingness to support missionary efforts with funds and land. This suggests a nuanced relationship where local traditions were open to foreign religious practices, viewing them as beneficial. Together, these sources demonstrate both the acceptance of missionaries as agents of civilization and the cultural tensions that arose from their presence.

# Missionary activities played a significant role in the cultural and religious transformation of African societies during the colonial period.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that missionary activities played a significant role in the cultural and religious transformation of African societies during the colonial period, albeit with varying emphases. The "General History of Africa" provides substantial evidence, highlighting how missionary societies were influential entities that not only spread Christianity but also established educational institutions closely linked to their evangelical missions. These schools introduced Western education and technical skills, contributing to the emergence of an educated African elite. Missionaries also facilitated the introduction of a money economy and commercial crops, further influencing African societies. They often acted as agents for European colonialism, paving the way for colonial rule and encouraging European intervention. Despite this, the text acknowledges resistance and adaptation by African societies, with some Africans rejecting Christianity and maintaining traditional religious practices. In contrast, The African Times articles offer a glimpse into the active engagement of missionary activities, describing meetings held by the Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Chapel, which involved local participation and support, as evidenced by the collection of funds like nearly ninety bags of cowries. The presence of speeches, reports, and social gatherings, such as a dinner at the Rev. Mr. Marshall's residence, underscores the communal aspects of these activities. However, the articles do not provide explicit evidence of broader cultural changes or the overall impact on African societies, which is crucial to the claim. Together, these sources illustrate the profound impact of missionary activities on African cultural and religious landscapes during the colonial era, while also highlighting the complexity and varied dimensions of this transformation.

# The introduction of perforated copper coins in Africa was seen as a necessary step to modernize the currency system.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times articles provide complementary perspectives on the claim regarding the introduction of perforated copper coins in Africa as a necessary step to modernize the currency system. The textbook does not specifically mention perforated copper coins but discusses the broader context of currency modernization in colonial Africa, emphasizing the replacement of traditional currencies with European coins and the establishment of currency boards to facilitate this transition. This modernization aimed to encourage cash crop production and integrate African economies into the capitalist world economy, aligning with the broader narrative of economic changes during the colonial period. In contrast, The African Times article directly supports the claim by highlighting the drawbacks of using cowrie shells, such as the heavy losses for petty traders and the reluctance of principal merchants to accept them due to their fluctuating value and counting inconvenience. The article links the scarcity of coins to increased prices of goods like palm oil, complicating trade and discouraging economic activity. It advocates for perforated copper coins as a means to encourage commerce and civilization, improve economic conditions in places like Accra, and replace cowries, indicating a belief in the necessity of modernizing the currency system. Together, these sources illustrate a shared theme of currency modernization, with The African Times providing specific support for the introduction of perforated copper coins as a beneficial and necessary step.

# The absence of gold as a currency in Africa, despite its value, suggests unique economic or cultural factors that prioritized other forms of currency.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the absence of gold as a currency in Africa, despite its value. The General History of Africa highlights that gold was indeed used in various forms, such as dust or nuggets, and was integral to traditional economic systems through trade for goods like salt, kola nuts, and livestock. However, the introduction of modern currencies by colonial powers, such as European coins, led to the demonetization of traditional currencies, including gold dust, as part of a colonial agenda to integrate African economies into the global capitalist system. This suggests that the absence of gold as a currency was more a result of colonial economic policies rather than inherent cultural or economic preferences within African societies. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize that gold, although abundant, never attained the status of money and was treated as a commodity to be exchanged for other forms of currency, such as silver coins, cowrie shells, iron, cotton strips, and salt packages. The articles highlight the Maria Theresa dollar, a silver coin, as the true standard of currency across Africa, suggesting a preference for silver over gold. Additionally, the articles note that widely used currencies like the Maria Theresa dollars and cowries had no intrinsic value except as adornments, indicating a cultural aspect to their use. The practical utility of other currencies, such as iron for tools and salt for food, contrasts with the ornamental value of gold, which may have contributed to its exclusion as a currency. Together, these observations suggest that both colonial influences and unique economic or cultural factors played roles in shaping the choice of currency in Africa, leading to the absence of gold as a currency.

# The prohibition of religious worship in Fernando Po was not aligned with the intentions of the Spanish Government, suggesting a disconnect between colonial governance and central policy.

The examination of the claim regarding the prohibition of religious worship in Fernando Po reveals a nuanced understanding when combining insights from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not specifically address the prohibition of religious worship or the intentions of the Spanish Government in this context. It notes the proclamation of Catholicism as the official religion by the Spanish governor in 1858, which adversely affected the British Baptists at Clarence, but it does not discuss whether this action was aligned with the broader intentions of the Spanish Government. This absence of information highlights a gap in the textbook regarding the alignment or disconnect between colonial governance and central policy. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed support for the claim of a disconnect, noting that the prohibition of Protestant worship by the Governor of Fernando Po was not aligned with the Spanish Government's intentions. The articles cite the Minister for the Colonies, who expressed regret that Fernando Po was excluded from the decree granting religious freedom to other Spanish colonies, suggesting an oversight rather than a deliberate policy. Furthermore, the articles emphasize that the Spanish Government had declared support for religious freedom, which was not being implemented in Fernando Po, indicating a misalignment between central policies and colonial actions. The involvement of British officials and their appeals to the Spanish Government further underscore this perceived disconnect. Together, these observations suggest a significant misalignment between the intentions of the Spanish Government and the actions of the colonial administration in Fernando Po.

# Efforts to secure religious freedom in Fernando Po highlight the broader struggle for religious rights in colonial territories.

Efforts to secure religious freedom in Fernando Po serve as a significant example of the broader struggle for religious rights in colonial territories, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa details the British Baptist Mission Society's activities in Fernando Po, including the establishment of missions by Joseph Merrick in Bell Town and Bimbia, and the conflicts that arose from mass conversion efforts. British intervention to protect missionaries and converts, alongside the Spanish governor's 1858 proclamation of Catholicism as the official religion, which forced Baptists to establish a new settlement at Ambas Bay named Victoria, underscores the local struggle for religious freedom. While the textbook focuses on specific incidents and local dynamics, The African Times articles emphasize the broader implications by highlighting the prohibition of Protestant worship in Fernando Po, despite religious freedom in other Spanish territories like Cuba and Porto Rico. The involvement of British officials, such as the Earl of Clarendon, in appealing to the Spanish Government for religious freedom, illustrates the international dimension of this struggle. The articles also reference the historical context of Protestant missionaries during British rule, reflecting the colonial legacy's impact on religious rights. Although both sources focus primarily on Fernando Po, they collectively underscore the complexities and negotiations involved in securing religious freedoms, aligning with the broader theme of religious rights struggles in colonial territories.

# The transition of Fernando Po from British to Spanish rule resulted in the loss of religious freedom for Protestant missionaries and their followers on the island.

The transition of Fernando Po from British to Spanish rule resulted in a significant loss of religious freedom for Protestant missionaries and their followers on the island, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details that in 1858, the Spanish governor declared Catholicism the official religion, making the position of British Baptist missionaries untenable and prompting Alfred Saker to establish a new settlement at Ambas Bay, named Victoria, due to local opposition. While the textbook does not explicitly mention the political transition, it highlights the imposition of Catholicism and the challenges faced by Protestant missionaries. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly address the transition, noting that under British rule, Protestant missionaries conducted their activities freely. However, once Spanish control was restored, the Spanish authorities compelled Protestant missionaries to cease their services, leading to the relocation of some followers to Victoria and depriving others, including British Protestant traders, of public religious practice. Despite broader changes in Spain suggesting increased religious freedom, the Governor of Fernando Po continued to prohibit Protestant worship, unlike policies in other Spanish territories such as Cuba and Porto Rico. Together, these sources illustrate the loss of religious freedom for Protestants following the governance transition.

# The expulsion of Primitive Methodist missionaries from Fernando Po by the Spanish Governor reflects a broader pattern of religious oppression under Spanish colonial rule in Africa.

The claim that the expulsion of Primitive Methodist missionaries from Fernando Po by the Spanish Governor reflects a broader pattern of religious oppression under Spanish colonial rule in Africa is addressed differently by the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not specifically mention the expulsion of these missionaries or directly address a broader pattern of religious oppression by the Spanish in Africa. However, it provides context on religious tensions and missionary activities in the region, noting that in 1858, the Spanish governor declared Catholicism the official religion of Fernando Po, which forced British Baptist missionaries to relocate. This suggests a preference for Catholicism that could be interpreted as religious imposition. The textbook also discusses conflicts between missionaries and local populations and the role of religion in resistance against colonial rule, but these are not specifically linked to Spanish practices. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the expulsion of Primitive Methodist missionaries as part of a broader pattern of religious oppression, highlighting the prohibition of Protestant worship on the island and the exclusion of Fernando Po from a decree granting freedom of worship to other Spanish colonies like Cuba and Porto Rico. The articles emphasize the contrast between the religious freedom under British rule and the oppressive measures under Spanish governance, reinforcing the notion of a broader pattern of religious oppression. However, they do not provide information on whether similar patterns occurred in other Spanish colonies in Africa, which is a notable difference from the claim.

# The health conditions of military personnel in Western Africa were severely impacted by inadequate medical facilities and long travel distances to potential treatment sites.

The health conditions of military personnel in Western Africa were severely impacted by inadequate medical facilities and long travel distances to potential treatment sites, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the insufficient medical facilities available to both European and African soldiers, noting that medical services were primarily focused on Europeans until the First World War, with African troops having limited access. By 1939, the ratio of doctors to the population in Nigeria was lower than in 1914, and hospitals for Africans were grossly inadequate compared to those for Europeans. The text also describes high mortality rates among European soldiers due to indigenous diseases, indicating Europe's lack of medical preparedness for its African ventures. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the lack of attention given to Western Africa, resulting in officers having limited means to preserve their health, aligning with the claim of inadequate medical facilities. The articles further discuss the significant travel distances to treatment sites, such as the Cameroons Mountains, which are about 2,000 miles from military stations like the Gambia or Sierra Leone. This distance posed a considerable challenge for sick officers, especially those with severe illnesses, as the uncomfortable and lengthy journey often led to adverse outcomes before reaching the destination. Together, these observations underscore the severe health impacts on military personnel in Western Africa due to inadequate medical facilities and long travel distances to treatment sites.

# The adaptation of colonial strategies, such as relocating to higher altitudes, reflects the ongoing struggle of European colonizers to acclimate to and survive in the African environment.

The adaptation of colonial strategies, such as relocating to higher altitudes, reflects the ongoing struggle of European colonizers to acclimate to and survive in the African environment. The General History of Africa textbook does not explicitly mention this specific strategy, but it highlights the broader challenges faced by Europeans, such as the inhospitable climate and the need for medical advancements like quinine to combat malaria. It also discusses the use of indigenous personnel and institutions to support colonial rule, indicating an adaptation strategy to manage the local environment and population. This suggests an ongoing struggle to adapt to African conditions, although the specific strategy of relocating to higher altitudes is not addressed. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide several details supporting the claim, describing high mortality rates among Europeans in lowland areas like Santa Isabel due to diseases such as yellow fever, which prompted a shift to higher altitudes for better health outcomes. The success of the Jesuit mission at Banapa and the establishment of a military sanitarium at Santa Cecilia, both at higher elevations, illustrate efforts to mitigate adverse health effects. Additionally, the articles mention the health benefits of higher-altitude locations in Sierra Leone, such as the barracks above Freetown and the potential of Sugar Loaf Mountain as a military sanitarium. These examples align with the claim by highlighting strategic relocation to higher altitudes as a response to the challenges posed by the African environment, though the articles do not discuss broader colonial strategies or long-term implications, which could interest historians studying the colonial experience in Africa.

# The competition between British and French interests in Africa was marked by strategic territorial claims and treaties.

The competition between British and French interests in Africa was marked by strategic territorial claims and treaties, as evidenced by both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides substantial evidence of Anglo-French rivalry through events such as the Anglo-French convention of 1863 and the Anglo-French Partition of Borgu in 1895, which highlight the strategic territorial claims made by both nations. It also discusses significant agreements like the Say-Barruwa Agreement (1890) and the Niger Convention (1898), which concluded the partition of West Africa between Britain and France. These treaties were part of the larger "Scramble for Africa," where European powers formalized their territorial claims, with regions like Egypt being of strategic importance to British interests. Similarly, The African Times articles underscore the strategic nature of these claims by detailing tensions from French treaties with the Abeokutans that threatened British trade interests in Lagos, and the potential cession of Bornu to France, which would impact the British Niger Company's trade. The articles also mention a new treaty with Borgu that prevented French advancement on the west of the Lower Niger, illustrating the strategic use of treaties to delineate spheres of influence. Both sources emphasize the competitive nature of British and French territorial ambitions in Africa, driven by strategic treaties and the desire to control trade routes and regions.

# British traders were resistant to ceding their colonies and trade in Africa to France, fearing economic and territorial losses.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of British traders' resistance to ceding their colonies and trade in Africa to France, driven by fears of economic and territorial losses. The General History of Africa highlights Britain's commitment to free trade as a reflection of its global hegemony, underscoring a strong desire to maintain economic dominance. It describes British efforts to secure privileges for European traders in Africa, often at the expense of African rulers, indicating a reluctance to share economic control. Although the textbook does not explicitly mention British resistance to French encroachment, it emphasizes Britain's focus on controlling African economies and resources, as well as suppressing non-British goods, supporting the notion of resistance to economic losses. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific instances of British traders' objections to exchanging the Gambia colony with France, citing the limited value of French territories like Assinie and Porto Novo. The traders aimed to maintain control over the Gambia hinterland to prevent French encirclement and expressed concerns over losing influence in the hinterlands of the Gold Coast and Sierra Leone due to French annexation efforts. The articles also describe the economic impact of French expansion, such as the boycott of British markets by tribes under French influence and the movement of natives into British-controlled areas. While the articles do not mention formal negotiations or agreements regarding the cession of colonies, they focus on the broader context of French encroachment and its effects on British trade and territorial control. Together, these sources illustrate a general British resistance to losing economic control in Africa, with The African Times providing more specific examples of resistance against France.

# The role of consuls in Africa involved navigating complex relationships with both European merchants and native authorities.

The role of consuls in Africa involved navigating complex relationships with both European merchants and native authorities, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights how British consuls on the coast acted as mediators in inter-state wars and peace treaties, such as those between Bonny and Elem Kalahari, and between Opobo and Bonny. These consuls balanced the interests of European traders and missionaries with those of African states, which sought to maintain sovereignty and control over trade. They also managed conflicts arising from European political interference, exemplified by the removal of African leaders like Jaja of Opobo and King Ibanichuka of Okrika. The appointment of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny marked a shift towards protecting British interests against other European and African interests. Similarly, The African Times articles underscore the esteem in which consuls like Mr. Hartley and Mr. Hopkins were held by both European merchants and native authorities, highlighting their diplomatic skills in managing relationships across different groups. Mr. Hartley's experience as Vice-Consul at Loanda and his successor's knowledge of the oil rivers emphasize the importance of understanding local dynamics. Mr. Hopkins is praised for his ability to handle delicate matters, crucial for resolving issues successfully. Both sources reinforce the notion that consuls played a significant role in mediating between European and local interests, essential for maintaining trade and diplomatic relations.

---

# The appointment of consuls was influenced by commercial interests, highlighting the connection between British commercial interests and diplomatic appointments in Africa.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the appointment of consuls was influenced by commercial interests, particularly highlighting the connection between British commercial interests and diplomatic appointments in Africa. The General History of Africa textbook provides several examples, such as the appointment of Samuel Procter as the consul in London due to his successful business dealings with Madagascar, and Monsieur Hilarión Roux as Madagascar's Consul General in Paris, a prominent French trader with ties to Madagascar. These instances underscore the influence of commercial success on diplomatic roles. Additionally, the textbook discusses the broader context of British interests in Africa, where economic forces were deemed crucial for promoting British interests overseas, as articulated by Lord Salisbury in 1895. This illustrates how British diplomatic and commercial strategies were intertwined, with consular appointments serving to advance and protect British commercial interests. However, the text does not explicitly state that British consuls in Africa were appointed solely based on commercial interests. Complementing this, The African Times articles highlight the appointment of Consul David Hopkins, who was recommended by the principal commercial houses in Liverpool, indicating that commercial entities played a significant role in influencing diplomatic appointments. This connection between commercial interests and diplomatic roles aligns with the claim, suggesting that economic considerations were indeed a factor in the selection of consuls. The articles do not provide any information that refutes the claim, reinforcing the notion that commercial interests were influential in such appointments. Together, these sources illustrate the significant role commercial interests played in shaping diplomatic appointments in Africa.

# M. de Brazza's expedition was part of a broader French effort to expand influence and commerce in Africa.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that M. de Brazza's expedition was part of a broader French effort to expand influence and commerce in Africa. The textbook details Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's multiple journeys from the French trading post of Gabon between 1875 and 1885, aligning with France's strategy to extend territorial claims and establish commercial and missionary presence in Central Africa. This is contextualized within France's broader imperial ambitions, marked by military conquests and colonial expansions in West Africa, North Africa, and Madagascar during the late 19th century, as part of a larger European competition for dominance in Africa. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the French government's significant support for de Brazza's mission, including the provision of armed forces, rifles, gunpowder, and gifts to engage with native chiefs, underscoring the strategic importance of the expedition. M. de Brazza's speech, emphasizing the mission as a task for France, and the involvement of the Geographical Society of Bordeaux further illustrate national interests in expanding French influence and commerce. The establishment of posts along the river Ogoné and treaties with natives to secure logistical support reflect efforts to create a network of influence in the region. Both sources corroborate the claim by situating de Brazza's expeditions within the context of France's aggressive expansionist policies in Africa.

# The naming of geographical features by European explorers reflects a colonial mindset of claiming and possessing foreign lands.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the naming of geographical features by European explorers reflects a colonial mindset of claiming and possessing foreign lands. The General History of Africa textbook does not directly address this aspect of colonialism, focusing instead on the administrative, economic, and social impacts, such as the implementation of indirect rule and the exploitation of resources. While it discusses the broader colonial mindset, it does not specifically mention the act of naming geographical features as a form of claiming or possessing foreign lands, highlighting a gap in the textbook's exploration of this particular aspect of colonialism. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide detailed examples supporting the claim. They describe how explorers like Captain Burton named various locations, such as "Mann's Spring," "Victoria and Albert," and "Mount Helen," often in honor of European figures, suggesting a sense of ownership and imposition of European identity on the landscape. The naming of "Augusta Victoria Bay" after the German Empress further illustrates this practice, symbolizing a colonial assertion of control and influence. The absence of counterexamples in the articles reinforces the notion of a colonial approach to exploration and naming, aligning with the mindset of claiming foreign lands.

# The challenges faced by explorers in penetrating dense jungles, such as those in Ceylon, might also have been encountered by those exploring West African forests.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the challenges faced by explorers in dense forest regions, drawing parallels between the jungles of Ceylon and the forests of West Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the slow and arduous process of penetrating the African forest, particularly in the Congo basin, which remained sparsely populated by hunters and gatherers until the fifteenth century. This suggests that the dense forests of West Africa posed significant obstacles to exploration and settlement, akin to those in Ceylon. The text also mentions the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, such as the ancient overland routes used by explorers like Hugh Clapperton and the Landers, which facilitated movement but underscored the complexity of traversing the region. However, it lacks specific details about the physical challenges of the forest itself, such as vegetation density or wildlife, which are more directly comparable to the jungles of Ceylon. In contrast, The African Times provides a detailed account of Professor Haeckel's experiences in Ceylon, highlighting challenges like impenetrable vegetation, the necessity of tools like axes and fire, and encounters with wildlife, including mosquitoes, ants, and thorny plants. The editor suggests that these challenges could also apply to West African forests, implying a similarity in the dense and challenging nature of these jungles. However, the articles do not offer specific details about West African forests, making the comparison largely speculative. Despite this, the editor's suggestion points to a perceived similarity in the challenges faced by explorers in both regions.

# Captain Storms' temporary loss of sight raises questions about the environmental conditions and health risks faced by explorers in different parts of Africa.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim regarding Captain Storms' temporary loss of sight and the environmental conditions and health risks faced by explorers in Africa. The "General History of Africa" does not specifically mention Captain Storms or his condition but offers a broader context of the health challenges and diseases prevalent during the time of exploration and colonization. It highlights the high mortality rates among Europeans due to indigenous diseases, the spread of epidemics like smallpox and cholera, and the inadequate medical infrastructure to combat tropical diseases, indirectly supporting the notion that explorers faced significant health risks. In contrast, The African Times articles provide some context about Captain Storms' condition, noting that he described a region near Lake Tanganyika as an "African Eden" with healthful conditions, which improved his health compared to Europe. However, they clarify that his temporary loss of sight was contracted on the East Coast of Africa and developed during his sea voyage home, suggesting it was not related to the environmental conditions at Lake Tanganyika. This distinction indicates that while the general health risks for explorers in Africa are acknowledged, Captain Storms' specific condition does not directly raise questions about the health risks in that particular region. The articles do not address environmental conditions or health risks in other parts of Africa, which contrasts with the broader context provided by the textbook.

# The African-Aid Society's mission and challenges were comparable to those faced by other organizations in their early stages, highlighting the slow development common in impactful organizations.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the African-Aid Society's mission and challenges were comparable to those faced by other organizations in their early stages, highlighting the slow development common in impactful organizations. The General History of Africa textbook provides a broader context of organizational development in Africa, noting the slow progress of trade unions and workers' organizations, which, like the African-Aid Society, were influenced by socio-economic and political constraints, the spread of education, urbanization, and the rudimentary capitalist economy in colonial Africa. This slow development is mirrored in the gradual incorporation of Africa into the world-economy, which, despite resistance, led to new labor-supply structures and economic changes. The emergence of ethnic unions and youth movements in response to colonial pressures further reflects the challenges faced by early organizations. Although the textbook does not specifically mention the African-Aid Society, it aligns with the claim by highlighting common challenges and gradual progress. Meanwhile, The African Times articles draw a parallel between the African-Aid Society and the Church Missionary Society, both of which faced initial skepticism and fluctuating support, with the Church Missionary Society's early income ranging from three to a thousand pounds annually. This comparison underscores the common early struggles of gaining recognition and support, suggesting that the African-Aid Society's challenges are part of a broader pattern observed in organizations that eventually achieve significant impact. The African-Aid Society's mission to combat material evils and the slave trade aligns with the broader goals of missionary societies, reinforcing the claim of comparable missions and challenges. However, the articles lack specific details on the African-Aid Society's financial situation or public reception, which could offer a more direct comparison to the Church Missionary Society's early experiences. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the slow development and common challenges faced by impactful organizations in their formative years.

# The African-Aid Society aimed to prepare Africa for an influx of colonial civilization, suggesting a belief in the potential benefits of such influence on African progress.

The claim that the African-Aid Society aimed to prepare Africa for an influx of colonial civilization, suggesting a belief in the potential benefits of such influence on African progress, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences. The General History of Africa does not explicitly mention the African-Aid Society or any organization with this specific aim. However, it discusses the role of missionaries and colonial governments in promoting European intervention and influence in Africa, often with the belief that such influence would bring progress and development. Missionaries are described as agents of colonialism who believed European intervention would provide security, protection, and economic opportunities for Africans. The textbook also highlights the introduction of infrastructure, education, and urbanization as aspects of colonial influence perceived as beneficial by some writers, aligning with the notion of preparing Africa for colonial civilization. In contrast, The African Times news articles explicitly mention the African-Aid Society's objective to prepare Africa for the "influx of colonial civilization" and to accelerate her progress through this influence. The Society is portrayed as a necessary and vital entity for Africa, aiming to bring about "real, deep, and important improvements" and to raise Africa from its "degradation." The articles emphasize the need for Africa to be "roused to industrial vigour and productive activity" and suggest that the forces of "Christian civilization" must work together to achieve material and moral regeneration. However, they also reflect a paternalistic attitude, suggesting that "good must be forced upon" Africa and that the continent must be won over through material benefits to achieve moral change, underscoring the colonial mindset of the period. While the textbook does not mention the African-Aid Society, the articles provide explicit support for the claim, highlighting the Society's belief in the transformative potential of colonial civilization and its efforts to facilitate this process.

# The passage suggests that Africa requires external intervention to achieve industrial and moral regeneration.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that Africa requires external intervention for industrial and moral regeneration. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced view, highlighting the internal efforts of African leaders during the nineteenth century to reform their societies, often drawing inspiration from indigenous cultures and Islamic reformist ideas. These efforts were frequently undermined by European traders, missionaries, and colonial powers, suggesting a refutation of the claim by emphasizing African agency and self-development. The text also discusses the disruptive role of missionaries as agents of colonialism and acknowledges the influence of American blacks and pan-Africanism, which were external but non-European interventions contributing to African political and ideological visions. In contrast, The African Times strongly supports the claim, asserting that Africa requires external intervention for regeneration. The article explicitly states that "Good must be forced upon her" and argues that Africa's profound degradation necessitates external forces to lead an "army of regeneration" through material benefits and moral change. It emphasizes the need for a combination of "Christian civilization," including civilized government, industrial development, and moral and spiritual teaching, to achieve transformation. This perspective reinforces the idea that Africa's progress is contingent upon external efforts. Together, these sources illustrate a complex dialogue between African self-development and the perceived necessity of external intervention.

# The construction of roads in the Gold Coast was seen as essential for military and economic purposes, but financial constraints hindered their development.

The construction of roads in the Gold Coast was seen as essential for both military and economic purposes, but financial constraints hindered their development, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights that infrastructure, including roads, was primarily constructed to facilitate the evacuation of exports and connect mineral-rich areas to ports, aligning with the economic motivations for road construction. However, it does not explicitly mention financial constraints specific to the Gold Coast or the military purpose of road construction. In contrast, The African Times provides details supporting the military significance of road construction, noting efforts to make roads cleared for military purposes permanently available and a deputation advocating for a military road from Cape Coast to Prahsoo. The articles also emphasize financial constraints, with a letter from C. Fortescue acknowledging the inadequacy of the Gold Coast's revenues for road development. While the textbook discusses financial constraints in colonial Africa more broadly, it does not directly link them to road construction in the Gold Coast, unlike The African Times, which explicitly highlights these financial challenges. Together, these sources illustrate the dual motivations for road construction and the financial hurdles faced, with each source providing complementary insights into the claim.

# The dangers and challenges of maritime travel along the African coast during the 19th century.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively highlight the dangers and challenges of maritime travel along the African coast during the 19th century. The textbook details the socio-political and economic challenges, such as the threat posed by Maghrib corsairs and the complex trade dynamics, including the tribute levied by Maghribian states, which complicated navigation and trade. It also notes the involvement of Kru towns in the slave trade, creating a risky environment for sailors, and the technological challenges posed by the transition from sail to steamships. However, it does not explicitly address natural maritime dangers like weather conditions or navigational hazards. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide specific instances of maritime peril, such as the wreck of the brigantine Exemplar off the River Nun, resulting in the loss of crew members, underscoring the perilous nature of sea travel. Yet, they also report successful voyages, like those of the steamships Ethiopia, Biafra, and Elmina, which arrived in Liverpool without incident, suggesting that while maritime travel could be dangerous, it was not uniformly so. The articles, however, lack extensive details on specific challenges like weather or navigation. Together, these sources present a nuanced view of maritime travel along the African coast, acknowledging both the significant risks and the routine nature of successful voyages during the period.

# The economic and political influence exerted by European trading companies and chartered companies in Africa during the colonial period.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim regarding the economic and political influence exerted by European trading companies and chartered companies in Africa during the colonial period. The General History of Africa highlights that these companies initially undertook policing and coercion on their own behalf, playing a crucial role in dismantling African political independence and establishing colonial economies. They engaged in brutal labor recruitment practices and bore the costs of armed interventions, although they eventually struggled with coercive state functions, prompting European states to assume direct control over colonial territories. Expatriate banking, shipping, and trading firms dominated export and import trade, fixed prices, and accrued substantial profits, often at the expense of Africans, thereby eliminating them from profitable economic sectors and hindering the development of African business acumen. European trading companies expanded the traders' frontier and cash sector, appropriating surplus generated by peasant production through unequal exchange, with profits frequently expatriated. Similarly, The African Times articles underscore the presence and involvement of European entities such as F. and A. Swanzy, Basel Mission Factory, Bremen Factory, and the Royal Niger Company in African trade and commerce. The Royal Niger Company's imposition of customs duties on merchandise and native produce, along with its interactions with local rulers like the King of Onitsha, exemplifies the economic control and political influence these companies wielded. The discussion in the House of Commons about the Royal Niger Company's operations and its incorporation by Royal Charter further reflects the formal recognition and supervision by the British Government, illustrating the intertwining of economic interests and colonial governance. Together, these sources vividly illustrate the significant economic and political impact European trading and chartered companies had on African societies during the colonial era.

# The involvement of European military or naval forces in African coastal regions.

The involvement of European military or naval forces in African coastal regions is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with varying emphases. The General History of Africa provides detailed accounts of European powers, particularly between 1880 and 1914, using military invasions and occupations to establish control over West Africa, often initiating from coastal regions. Notable examples include British military campaigns launched from coastal possessions on the Gold Coast and in Nigeria, and French campaigns in the Western Sudan and Ivory Coast. During the First World War, European naval forces were active in African coastal areas, exemplified by the bombardment of Dar es Salaam and Tanga by British cruisers, and the strategic targeting of African ports in German colonies to prevent their use by German warships. These instances underscore the significant role of European military and naval forces in securing and maintaining control over African coastal regions. In contrast, The African Times articles provide indirect support for the claim, mentioning European individuals like Mr. D. Ballie, A. Bell, and Captain Gaade in Fernando Po, and Captain Diaper in Bonny, suggesting a European presence in these coastal areas, likely in civilian or exploratory roles. Additionally, reports of a large party of white soldiers near Lake Nyassa, armed with Remingtons and commanded by white men, hint at a possible European military presence inland, though the reliability of this account is questioned. The mention of Lieutenant Wissmann, a German explorer traveling from Cairo to Zanzibar, further indicates European exploratory activities. However, the articles do not provide direct evidence of organized European military or naval operations specifically targeting African coastal regions, highlighting a difference between the claim and the content of the articles. Together, these sources illustrate the complexity of European involvement in African coastal regions, with the textbook emphasizing military and naval engagements, while the news articles suggest a broader European presence.

# The exploration and exploitation of African natural resources as a significant aspect of colonial interest in Africa.

The exploration and exploitation of African natural resources were significant aspects of colonial interest in Africa, as evidenced by both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides substantial evidence of how mineral resources were predominantly exploited with foreign capital, often excluding Africans from benefiting due to legislative measures favoring imperialist interests. It highlights the systematic monopolization of lucrative industries, such as diamond mining, by colonial administrations, exemplified by the Sierra Leone Selection Trust's exclusive rights. The rapid expansion of the export sector, driven by agricultural products and minerals, laid the foundation of the colonial economy through the commercialization of land and the introduction of cash crops, primarily produced by Africans. Coerced African labor was central to mining and plantation industries, with profits largely repatriated to Europe. The text also notes that colonial activities often centered around regions with prior involvement in intercontinental trade, underscoring the colonial focus on resource exploitation. Complementing this, The African Times articles detail the trade of commodities like ground-nuts, palm oil, cotton, benni seed, and palm kernels, indicating a focus on extraction and sale of natural resources. The reporting on prices, quantities, and origins of these commodities suggests a well-established trade network driven by colonial interests in maximizing resource extraction for economic gain. The exploration narrative describes journeys to prospect mines, further emphasizing the colonial pursuit of valuable resources. Infrastructure developments, such as a sanitarium, hospital, and store in Prince Town, align with colonial strategies to support resource exploitation. However, the articles lack explicit discussion of broader colonial policies or the impact on local populations, focusing instead on economic activities without addressing the socio-political implications of colonialism. Together, these sources underscore the centrality of resource exploitation in colonial Africa, highlighting both the economic strategies and the exclusionary practices that characterized this period.

# The influence of European figures and institutions in shaping African societies during the colonial period.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim regarding the influence of European figures and institutions in shaping African societies during the colonial period. The "General History of Africa" provides substantial evidence supporting the claim, highlighting the significant role of European missionary societies in East Africa, which not only spread Christianity but also established theocratic states that weakened local societies and facilitated colonial rule. It discusses how colonial powers manipulated traditional governance systems, often deposing or co-opting local rulers, thereby diminishing their authority and altering indigenous political structures. The imposition of European-planned taxes and the spread of Western education and Christianity further disrupted African societies, leading to the emergence of new social classes and the erosion of traditional cultural practices. Additionally, the text notes the impact of European trade, which undermined local economies and political autonomy, and acknowledges the influence of pan-Africanist figures like Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois, indicating a complex interplay between African and African-American leaders in shaping responses to colonialism. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide any direct information related to the influence of European figures and institutions on African societies during the colonial period. Instead, they describe the opening of a session at the University of London by Sir Rutherford Alcock, K.C.B., the Vice-President, an event situated in a European context without mentioning African societies or colonial influences. This absence of reference to African societies or colonial dynamics highlights a notable difference from the claim, which focuses on European influence in Africa during the colonial era. Therefore, while the articles mention a European figure and institution, they do not provide evidence or context that supports or refutes the claim regarding their influence on African societies.

# The debate among Africans about the benefits or detriments of European colonization.

The debate among Africans about the benefits or detriments of European colonization is richly illustrated by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a nuanced exploration of this debate, highlighting differing perspectives, including those of European historians like Margery Perham and D. K. Fieldhouse, who suggest a balanced view of colonialism's impact, acknowledging both positive and negative effects. In contrast, African and Marxist scholars, such as Walter Rodney, argue that colonialism was overwhelmingly exploitative, describing it as a "one-armed bandit" with virtually no beneficial impact. The text also discusses unintended positive consequences of colonialism, which were not deliberately calculated to benefit Africans, and emphasizes significant negative impacts, such as the loss of sovereignty, economic exploitation, and cultural degradation. Furthermore, it addresses social and economic disparities created by colonialism, such as the urban-rural divide and racial discrimination, which continue to affect African societies. The African Times articles complement this by detailing a public meeting in Lagos where a debate took place on whether European colonization was advantageous to Africa and the African race, directly supporting the claim by illustrating that such debates were indeed occurring among Africans. Miss Victoria Davies, one of the speakers, argued in favor of colonization, citing civilization, economic enrichment, and the propagation of Christianity, indicating diverse opinions among Africans. Additionally, the narrative of an African king's experiences in Europe highlights cultural and economic disparities, indirectly reflecting the complexities and challenges faced by Africans under European influence. Together, these sources reveal a broad spectrum of views and ongoing discussions about the legacy of colonialism in Africa, underscoring the complexity and diversity of opinions among Africans and scholars.

# Efforts to improve infrastructure or public services in Africa were often hindered by practical or financial constraints.

Efforts to improve infrastructure or public services in Africa have historically been hindered by both practical and financial constraints, as evidenced by observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights that infrastructure such as roads and railways was primarily constructed to facilitate resource extraction for European interests, rather than to promote overall economic development or inter-African connectivity. This limited focus resulted in regional disparities and neglected many areas. Financial constraints were significant during the colonial period, with infrastructure projects often funded by loans that increased internal debt, and during economic crises, capital projects were suspended, and social services were cut back. The reliance on cash crops further neglected the internal economy, exacerbating financial difficulties. Similarly, The African Times articles underscore practical challenges, such as the lack of suitable roofing materials, skilled labor, and cultural factors affecting building practices. The absence of skilled tile makers and a preference for clerical jobs over mechanical employments further impeded infrastructure development. Financial constraints are also evident in public health infrastructure, where the high cost of projects, like filling the swamp behind Bathurst, was deemed too large to justify, illustrating a financial barrier to improvements. Both sources align in demonstrating that practical and financial constraints significantly hindered infrastructure and public service improvements in Africa.

# Labor issues, such as shortages or contract enforcement, posed significant challenges to economic activities in Africa.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant challenges labor issues posed to economic activities in Africa. The textbook details various forms of resistance by African workers, such as strikes, work slowdowns, and sabotage, highlighting labor shortages and dissatisfaction with working conditions. It emphasizes the colonial economy's reliance on forced labor and coercive recruitment, which complicated efforts to maintain a stable workforce. High absenteeism and lack of cooperation from African workers were often misinterpreted by European officials as inherent slothfulness, ignoring the underlying grievances. The imposition of taxes and forced labor disrupted traditional agricultural practices, further destabilizing the economy. Additionally, enforcing labor contracts was problematic, as breaches were criminalized, reflecting the difficulties in maintaining a compliant labor force. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the challenges of employing European labor in West Africa, necessitating the importation of labor to address shortages. The risk of laborers leaving for competitors underscored the need for effective contract enforcement mechanisms. The articles also cite labor shortages as a key factor in the underperformance of the Wassau Gold Mining Company, despite the richness of its deposits, and note the unsuitability of the climate for white laborers, exacerbating the labor shortage. Together, these sources provide comprehensive evidence that labor issues, including shortages and contract enforcement, were significant impediments to economic activities in Africa.

# The economic potential of African regions extends beyond their primary resources, with opportunities for diversification if conditions allow.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced perspective on the economic potential of African regions beyond their primary resources, highlighting both historical limitations and future opportunities for diversification. The General History of Africa emphasizes the historical tendency towards monocultures, particularly in agricultural exports, which left African economies vulnerable and less diversified. This historical context suggests limited diversification opportunities, compounded by the disadvantageous integration of African economies into the global order and the exploitation of mineral resources with foreign capital, excluding Africans from benefiting. However, examples like Nigeria and Kenya's somewhat diversified economies and the potential for inter-zonal and inter-ethnic exchanges in Rwanda indicate that diversification is possible under improved conditions, such as equitable economic policies and better access to resources. Similarly, The African Times articles illustrate both challenges and opportunities for diversification. In the Gold Coast Colony, despite challenges in gold extraction, there is potential for diversification through tropical produce cultivation, contingent on improved labor supply and health management. In Morocco, while mineral resources are limited, the potential for agricultural development, particularly in cereal production, is highlighted, dependent on better market access and tax conditions. Together, these sources suggest that while historical and logistical challenges have hindered diversification, African regions possess economic potential beyond primary resources, which can be realized under favorable conditions.

# The movement and operations of steamships like the African Royal Mail Steamship Armenian, Calabar, and others highlight the extensive trade networks and maritime connections between Africa and Europe during the 19th century.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the extensive trade networks and maritime connections between Africa and Europe during the 19th century, facilitated by steamships like the African Royal Mail Steamship Armenian and Calabar. The General History of Africa highlights the transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, with European traders leveraging established coastal trade centers and inland routes. The introduction of steamships marked a significant advancement, enabling more efficient and reliable maritime connections by navigating against contrary winds and currents, thus expanding trade networks. This is evidenced by the regular mixed cargo and passenger lines between Brazil and West Africa and the increased flow of goods through Angolan ports. Although the textbook does not specifically mention the African Royal Mail Steamship Armenian, Calabar, or other named steamships, it supports the claim by providing the broader context of maritime trade expansion. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed evidence of these specific steamships' roles, noting their regular arrivals at Liverpool with gold dust, specie, and passengers, highlighting the economic exchanges between the regions. The articles also emphasize the extensive network of trade routes along the West African coast, mentioning ports like Benin, Fernando Po, Cameroons, and Lagos, and discussing the health and trade conditions at these ports. The presence of Her Majesty's ships and British officials further underscores the strategic and economic significance of these operations. While the articles do not delve into the broader geopolitical implications, they vividly illustrate the vibrant maritime trade between Africa and Europe facilitated by these steamships, aligning well with the claim.

# The increase in exports and imports suggests a period of economic growth in the region.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that an increase in exports and imports suggests a period of economic growth in the region. The General History of Africa highlights the economic expansion of the caliphate, evidenced by the growing number of traders, the extension of currency, and the rise in exports of finished goods and raw materials like ivory and shea-butter oil. The import of European manufactures, particularly cotton goods, multiplied significantly throughout the nineteenth century, indicating a robust trade environment. The expansion of the ivory and slave trade in Central Africa and the growth of export-oriented production in Southern Africa further support the notion of economic growth driven by increased trade. Additionally, the emergence of national enterprises and the rise in industrial output in Egypt during the inter-war period highlight a shift towards economic development. However, the textbook also notes the vulnerabilities of monoculture economies and the peripheral role of external trade compared to agriculture, suggesting that while trade increased, it did not uniformly translate to sustainable economic growth across all regions. Similarly, The African Times articles provide data from 1869 showing that imports rose to £380,381 from £317,432 in 1868, and exports increased to £363,262 from £271,949, indicating a positive trend in trade activity and suggesting economic expansion. The increase in Customs revenue from £30,475 in 1868 to £39,702 in 1869 further supports this notion. The articles also mention a significant coffee crop in Durban and Victoria, with an estimated return of £21,875, and the development of infrastructure such as road tramways, which are more cost-effective than railroads, pointing towards economic development and investment in the region. However, the articles do not provide a direct comparison of these figures with previous years beyond 1868-1869, limiting the view of long-term economic trends. Overall, both sources align with the claim of economic growth, though they highlight complexities, regional variations, and limitations in the data.

# The rapid increase in both imports and exports may reflect the impact of mineral discoveries on the local economy.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide insights into the claim that the rapid increase in both imports and exports may reflect the impact of mineral discoveries on the local economy. The General History of Africa supports this claim by detailing how the discovery of minerals, such as diamonds and gold in South Africa, led to a significant increase in exports, with gold becoming the leading export by 1890. This mining boom attracted capital and technical personnel from Britain, Europe, and the United States, stimulating economic activity and necessitating new imports, particularly European manufactured goods, as the local economy adjusted to global market demands. Infrastructure development, such as railways and roads, further facilitated trade. However, the textbook also notes that the benefits of this economic expansion were unevenly distributed, with foreign capital dominating the mining industry and local African participation being systematically excluded, limiting local economic development. In contrast, The African Times provides data on the imports and exports of Natal from 1843 to 1867, showing a significant increase in trade activity, particularly from the mid-1850s onwards. Imports rose from £11,712 in 1843 to £269,580 in 1867, while exports increased from £1,348 to £225,671 over the same period. While this trend could support the claim that mineral discoveries contributed to economic growth, the articles do not explicitly link these increases to mineral discoveries, leaving room for other potential factors influencing the economic changes. Thus, while the economic growth is evident, the specific impact of mineral discoveries remains an assumption in the articles, unlike the documented influence described in the textbook.

---

# The expansion of the railway system was seen as a catalyst for economic growth and trade development in the region.

The expansion of the railway system is widely recognized as a catalyst for economic growth and trade development in the region, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the significant impact of railways in countries like Uganda and Nigeria, where reduced transport costs spurred industrial growth, particularly in sectors such as groundnuts. In South Africa, the discovery of gold and diamonds necessitated railway construction, which in turn facilitated mining and infrastructure development. Similarly, in Northern Rhodesia, railways bolstered the export sector, especially mining. However, the textbook also notes that in many other African countries, railways contributed relatively little and were often seen as liabilities, suggesting a varied impact across the continent. It emphasizes that modern transportation, including railways, was more likely to be attracted to regions with existing economic potential rather than creating new export economies from scratch. Meanwhile, The African Times articles underscore the positive perception of railways, citing the success of the Natal Loan for railway extension and the anticipated completion of the railway between Stanley Pool and Matadi, which was expected to significantly boost palm oil exploitation in the Congo basin. The articles suggest that wherever the "iron horse" extends, trade is expected to follow, reinforcing the belief in railways as a driver of economic activity. While the articles do not present any contrary views, the textbook provides a nuanced perspective, acknowledging both the transformative potential and the limitations of railway expansion in different regions. Together, these sources affirm the role of railways in economic development while highlighting the complexity of their impact across Africa.

# The French colonial presence in Madagascar led to significant dissatisfaction among the local population.

The French colonial presence in Madagascar led to significant dissatisfaction among the local population, as evidenced by both the "General History of Africa" textbook and articles from The African Times. The textbook provides a detailed account of the loss of freedom and dignity experienced by the Malagasy people due to French colonization, which aimed to 'civilize' and 'assimilate' them, alienating them from their national identity. This dissatisfaction manifested in various forms of resistance, both armed and passive, as the Malagasy sought to combat colonial oppression and reclaim their dignity. The emergence of secret societies like Vy Vato Sakelika (VVS) and the formation of a national movement post-World War I further underscore the growing awareness and dissatisfaction among the Malagasy. The textbook also highlights the inadequacy of French explanations for Malagasy insurrections, which overlooked the essential struggle for freedom and the organizational ability of the insurgents. Similarly, The African Times articles report a strong anti-French sentiment among the population, with actions such as the French Minister marrying the Queen and taking possession of the Crown jewels likely exacerbating local dissatisfaction. The anticipation of a general outbreak underscores the tension and unrest attributed to the French presence, although a report from the _Liberté_ suggests a temporary stabilization with no immediate plan for a French expedition into the interior. Together, these sources illustrate the widespread discontent and resistance that characterized the Malagasy response to French colonial rule, aligning closely with the claim.

# The political situation in Madagascar during the French colonial period was highly unstable and disorganized.

The political situation in Madagascar during the French colonial period was characterized by significant instability and disorganization, as evidenced by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the breakdown of society within the Kingdom of Madagascar, marked by the collapse of the old order, oligarchic domination, and an economic crisis, all contributing to a profound moral and spiritual malaise. The French colonial conquest exacerbated these tensions, leading to the fall of the government and the failure to establish a cohesive nation-state. Scattered and uncoordinated resistance to French rule indicated a lack of organized political structure, further destabilized by internal tensions such as the decline in ancestor worship, forced conversions, and the rise of a Christianized elite. The French administration's imposition of a protectorate and the resulting insurrections and passive resistance underscored the disorganized political landscape. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles describe incidents that further illustrate this instability. A French subject's expulsion after defending himself against an armed robber, despite appealing to the Queen, points to a lack of legal stability and protection for foreigners. Additionally, the removal of a former Prime Minister who harbored animosity towards Europeans, and the redistribution of his wealth and wives, highlight a volatile political environment with ongoing power struggles. The appointment of a successor more favorable to Europeans underscores the shifting governance dynamics. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive picture of the unstable and disorganized political situation in Madagascar during the French colonial period.

# British trade interests in Madagascar were significantly larger than those of the French, influencing the British stance against French colonial ambitions.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary insights into the claim that British trade interests in Madagascar were significantly larger than those of the French, influencing the British stance against French colonial ambitions. The General History of Africa highlights Britain's friendly and undemanding relationship with Madagascar, exemplified by the Anglo-Malagasy treaty of 1865, which allowed British nationals to lease land and facilitated commerce through established embassies and technical assistance. This contrasted with France's unfriendly policies and rejected demands for land ownership. While the textbook suggests both nations had substantial trade interests, it does not explicitly state that British interests were significantly larger, instead pointing to a combination of trade, religious ties, and diplomatic relations as influencing British opposition to French ambitions. In contrast, The African Times articles assert that British trade with Madagascar was quadruple that of the French, with five times as many English as French subjects in the region. The economic importance of Madagascar to British interests is underscored by its role in supplying food to the British colony of Mauritius. The British Government's actions, such as deploying a man-of-war and strengthening the Consular Staff, further indicate that protecting British commerce and property was a priority, supporting the notion that substantial trade interests influenced their stance against French colonial ambitions. Together, these sources suggest that while both nations had significant interests, British trade interests were indeed substantial and played a crucial role in shaping their opposition to French actions in Madagascar.

# The French involvement in Madagascar led to significant disruptions in trade, particularly affecting British interests and causing economic losses for British merchants.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the impact of French involvement in Madagascar on trade, particularly concerning British interests. The General History of Africa highlights the tensions between France and Britain over Madagascar, noting that France's renewed interest in the island was partly driven by a desire to counter British influence and secure resources for French use. French colonial propaganda aimed to exclude British and American merchants by annexing Madagascar rather than competing on price. The text also mentions a treaty established between Britain and Madagascar in 1865, which was seen as cementing Anglo-Malagasy friendship, while French policies were perceived as unfriendly, potentially disrupting British trade interests. However, the textbook does not explicitly state that British merchants suffered economic losses due to French involvement, nor does it provide specific examples of trade disruptions directly affecting British merchants. In contrast, The African Times articles provide more direct evidence supporting the claim that French actions led to significant disruptions in trade, affecting British interests and causing economic losses. The articles report that British interests in Madagascar suffered due to the lack of Consular jurisdiction and the Malagasy government's refusal to allow the exportation of cattle and native products by British or foreign vessels. A communication from Messrs. Proctor Brothers highlights losses sustained because they could not land goods in Tamatave due to French actions, forcing them to sell unsuitable goods in Mauritius. Furthermore, it was noted in the House of Commons that British trade had been destroyed to the extent of nearly £1,000,000 a year since June 1883 due to French actions. While The African Times provides more concrete examples of economic losses, it lacks specific quantitative data on the extent of trade disruptions, which could be a point of difference for historians seeking comprehensive evidence. Together, these sources suggest that French involvement in Madagascar had a detrimental impact on British trade interests, with The African Times offering more direct evidence of economic losses.

# The French military presence in Madagascar was supported by local Malagasy groups against the Hovas, indicating a complex interplay of alliances and conflicts within the island.

The French military presence in Madagascar during the colonial period was marked by a complex interplay of alliances and conflicts, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced view, emphasizing widespread resistance against French colonial forces, such as the Menalamba uprising and various insurrections led by Malagasy clans and leaders. It notes the French attempts to negotiate with local chiefs and install military posts, but underscores the lack of coordination among Malagasy groups and the overall resistance to colonization, rather than support for the French against the Hovas. In contrast, The African Times articles offer details supporting the claim of local Malagasy groups aligning with the French against the Hovas. They describe how the French supported Malagasy factions refusing to pay customs duties to the Hovas by sending arms and equipping volunteers, with Commander Seignac playing a key role in military engagements against the Hovas. These articles illustrate the French alignment with certain Malagasy factions, highlighting the intricate dynamics of alliances and power struggles on the island. Together, these sources depict a multifaceted historical landscape, where resistance and collaboration coexisted, reflecting the complex nature of colonial interactions in Madagascar.

# The French intended to establish a protectorate over Madagascar, dismissing any potential treaties with the Hovas Government.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the French intended to establish a protectorate over Madagascar, dismissing any potential treaties with the Hovas Government. The textbook details how the French parliament, after Rainilaiarivony rejected their plan for a protectorate, voted to go to war, demonstrating a strong intent to impose their authority. The French navy's occupation of land and the demand for the 'exequatur' further illustrate their efforts to assert control. The ambiguous treaty of 1885, interpreted by the French as a protectorate agreement despite the absence of the term 'protectorate', underscores their dismissive attitude towards Malagasy sovereignty. Additionally, the French refusal to accept the abrogation of earlier treaties and their pressure to enforce the Lambert Charter highlight their intent to dominate Madagascar, driven by colonial propaganda and economic interests. The African Times articles corroborate this by mentioning influential Paris journals, believed to be inspired by the French Government, which stated that no treaty with the Hovas for rights over a portion of the island was to be considered, asserting that only a French protectorate over the entire island would satisfy France. The articles describe French actions as arrogant and high-handed, further supporting the notion that France was not interested in negotiating treaties but rather in asserting control. They also highlight disputes over land sales and the death of French sailors, used by France to justify their claims, indicating a dismissive attitude towards the Hovas Government's legal and territorial rights. Together, these sources depict a consistent narrative of French ambitions and actions aimed at establishing a protectorate over Madagascar, dismissing any potential treaties with the Hovas Government.

# The French protectorate over Madagascar was established through a treaty with the Hovas, which included financial indemnities and territorial occupation.

The claim that the French protectorate over Madagascar was established through a treaty with the Hovas, which included financial indemnities and territorial occupation, is supported by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, though with nuances that highlight the complexity of the situation. According to the General History of Africa, the treaty of 17 December 1885, while not explicitly labeled as a "protectorate" treaty, granted France significant rights, such as representing Madagascar in foreign relations and maintaining a military presence in Antananarivo. It also included financial indemnities, with France receiving ten million francs, and allowed the French navy to occupy Diego Suarez. However, the Malagasy government, led by Rainilaiarivony, did not recognize this treaty as establishing a protectorate, emphasizing the limitations outlined in the 'Appendix' to maintain the kingdom's independence. The French administration, however, interpreted it as a protectorate agreement, leading to diplomatic tensions and conflicts. The African Times corroborates these details, noting that the treaty granted France a protectorate and stationed a French Resident in Antananarivo to manage foreign affairs. It confirmed the indemnity of 10,000,000 francs and the occupation of Tamatave until payment. The articles also highlighted skepticism about the treaty's durability, with influential Paris journals suggesting that the Hovas might not respect it and that France's ultimate aim was a complete protectorate. This skepticism and anticipated resistance from the Hovas underscore the contested and complex nature of the French-Malagasy relations, indicating that the establishment of the protectorate was not straightforward and was met with opposition.

# The Malagasy people were united in their resistance to French demands and were prepared to fight to maintain their independence.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the Malagasy resistance to French colonial demands, highlighting both unity and division among the Malagasy people. The General History of Africa presents a nuanced perspective, noting instances of organized resistance such as the Menalamba rebellion and the 1904-5 insurrection, which demonstrate collective efforts to oppose French colonization and maintain independence. These movements were characterized by a return to ancestral beliefs and solidarity among clans against a common enemy. However, the text also underscores significant divisions, as the French employed a "divide and rule" strategy, exploiting regional, religious, and social dissensions, which hindered a unified national resistance. The lack of coordination among different resistance groups and varied motivations behind uprisings further illustrate these divisions. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim of unity, describing a significant gathering of twenty thousand representatives at Andohalo, where a unanimous rejection of French demands was expressed, indicating a collective stance against subordination. The articles emphasize that the Malagasy nation spoke with one voice, prepared to resist French aggression, even if it meant war, while also highlighting a preference for peace. This adds depth to the claim, showing that the Malagasy resistance was driven by a commitment to preserving sovereignty rather than a desire for conflict. Together, these sources reveal a complex picture of the Malagasy resistance, marked by moments of unity and readiness to defend independence, yet challenged by internal divisions and strategic colonial policies.

# The establishment of telegraph cables in Africa was driven by European economic interests and competition for communication dominance.

The establishment of telegraph cables in Africa was significantly driven by European economic interests and competition for communication dominance, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights that the construction of telegraph lines, alongside railways and roads, was a major focus of colonial administrations, primarily to facilitate the evacuation of exports and support the logistical needs of colonial conquests and resource extraction, indicating a strong economic motivation. It also notes that transport and communication lines were essential for occupied areas to serve as staging points for further aggression, suggesting a strategic interest in maintaining communication dominance. However, the textbook does not explicitly address the competitive aspect of communication dominance among European powers. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a detailed account of the competitive nature of telegraph cable projects, highlighting the involvement of European governments and companies, such as the Portuguese Government and the West African Telegraph Company, in developing telegraphic infrastructure along the West Coast of Africa. The articles mention contracts, concessions, and subsidies from Portuguese and French authorities, underscoring economic motivations and strategic importance. They also describe competition between telegraph companies, such as the West African Telegraph Company and the African Direct Telegraph Company, emphasizing the competitive drive to establish communication networks. The focus on creating alternative lines independent of European routes further suggests a desire for communication dominance and economic advantage. Together, these sources illustrate the intertwined economic and competitive drivers behind the telegraph cable projects in Africa.

# The construction of telegraph lines in Africa was part of a broader strategy to ensure reliable communication in the event of European conflicts.

The construction of telegraph lines in Africa, as observed from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, was part of a broader strategy that encompassed multiple objectives, including ensuring reliable communication in the event of European conflicts. The General History of Africa textbook provides context that these telegraph lines, along with other transport and communication infrastructure, were essential for European control and expansion, serving primarily to facilitate colonial administration and economic extraction. While the textbook does not explicitly link the telegraph lines to European military conflicts, it underscores their role in supporting colonial interests. In contrast, The African Times articles offer details that align more closely with the claim, noting that the telegraph routes included stations of various nationalities expected to remain friendly or neutral during European wars, suggesting strategic considerations for maintaining communication lines in potential conflicts. The articles also emphasize the telegraph lines' importance for commercial development and preventing surprise annexations, indicating a broader geopolitical strategy. Although neither source explicitly states that conflict preparedness was the primary motivation, both highlight the multifaceted strategic importance of telegraph lines, encompassing colonial control, economic interests, and considerations for European conflicts.

# The development of telegraph infrastructure in Africa was primarily focused on connecting European colonies and settlements, rather than serving the needs of local African populations.

The development of telegraph infrastructure in Africa was primarily focused on connecting European colonies and settlements, rather than serving the needs of local African populations, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights that colonial administrations prioritized the construction of infrastructure, including railways, roads, and telegraph lines, to facilitate the evacuation of exports and support colonial administration, rather than for the welfare of local populations. This infrastructure served as a prelude to conquest, necessary for logistical purposes in occupied areas, and was designed to support colonial interests and control. However, the textbook does not provide specific details about telegraph lines, focusing more broadly on general infrastructure developments. In contrast, The African Times provides specific details about the telegraph infrastructure, describing the laying of telegraph cables along the West Coast of Africa, with connections primarily at European-controlled locations such as Portuguese settlements, St. Thiago, Bathurst, Sierra Leone, Accra, and the Cape of Good Hope. The articles emphasize creating alternative lines of communication with India, Australia, and the Cape, independent of European lines, highlighting a focus on enhancing communication for European interests. Additionally, the discussion of government contracts and subsidies for telegraph companies underscores the involvement of European entities, with no mention of the needs or involvement of local African communities. Together, these sources support the claim that the telegraph infrastructure was primarily designed to serve European colonial interests rather than benefit indigenous populations.

# The establishment of telegraph cables along the West Coast of Africa was crucial for the commercial development of the region.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the role of telegraph cables in the commercial development of the West Coast of Africa. The textbook does not specifically mention telegraph cables, focusing instead on the impact of transportation infrastructure such as railways, roads, and ports in facilitating trade and economic activities. This absence suggests a gap in the textbook's coverage regarding the specific role of telegraph cables, indicating that while infrastructure was crucial for commercial development, the significance of telegraph cables is not highlighted. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed support for the claim that telegraph cables were crucial for the region's commercial development. The articles emphasize the strategic importance of these cables in connecting key ports and colonies, enhancing commercial activities by providing reliable communication links between Europe and West Africa. They also highlight the cables' role in reducing surprise annexations and improving oversight by the Colonial Office, suggesting their importance for both commercial and political stability. The involvement of multiple governments in subsidizing the telegraph lines further underscores their perceived economic significance. Thus, while the textbook overlooks the role of telegraph cables, The African Times articles reinforce their crucial role in fostering commercial growth in the region.

# The construction of telegraph lines in Africa by colonial powers like Great Britain and Portugal was a strategic move to enhance communication and control over their respective territories.

The construction of telegraph lines in Africa by colonial powers such as Great Britain and Portugal was a strategic move to enhance communication and control over their respective territories, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook outlines that the development of transport and communication infrastructure, including telegraph lines, was a prelude to conquest and necessary for logistical control in occupied areas, serving primarily the economic interests of the colonizers. This supports the idea of telegraph lines being part of a broader strategy for territorial control, although it does not specifically attribute these actions to Great Britain and Portugal. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly mention the involvement of these two colonial powers in facilitating telegraphic communication within their spheres, highlighting a strategic interest in improving communication infrastructure. The articles detail the importance of telegraphic services between the coast and the River Ruo, indicating a focus on maintaining control and efficient communication, and they note arbitration over unresolved issues related to telegraph line construction and tariffs, underscoring the strategic importance of these lines. Additionally, the articles emphasize the development of communication means in British colonies on the West Coast of Africa, reinforcing the notion that such infrastructure was crucial for colonial administration and control. While the articles do not delve into the broader strategic implications of territorial control, they align with the claim by underscoring the significance of telegraph lines for communication within colonial territories. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the strategic role telegraph lines played in colonial Africa, highlighting both general and specific aspects of their use by colonial powers.

# The complexities and contradictions in the colonial administration's approach to local customs and religious practices.

The complexities and contradictions in the colonial administration's approach to local customs and religious practices are well-documented in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the colonial administrators' mixed attitudes towards African religions, where efforts to suppress traditional beliefs, such as witchcraft and initiation rites, coexisted with allowances for certain Islamic institutions in some regions. This duality is evident in the varied responses to Islam, with some colonial powers viewing it as more advanced compared to traditional African beliefs, while others, like the Belgian administration in Congo, were hostile. Missionaries' attempts to convert Africans to Christianity often disregarded the integral unity of religion and life in African culture, leading to resistance and syncretism. The use of indirect rule and the creation of new authority structures, such as 'warrant chiefs,' further reflect contradictions, as these often undermined traditional authority while maintaining control. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight contradictory actions, such as a Commandant relying on Fetish priests to solve a robbery case despite efforts to eradicate such practices. The colonial administration's policy of "liberty of conscience," allowing diverse religious practices as long as they did not disturb others, reflects a nuanced yet contradictory approach. The Commandant's false accusations against Fetish priests illustrate further contradictions, undermining the freedoms the administration claimed to uphold. Together, these sources underscore the inherent complexities and contradictions in the colonial administration's interactions with local customs and religious practices.

# The persistence and complexity of indigenous religious practices in Africa despite European colonial influence.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence for the persistence and complexity of indigenous religious practices in Africa despite European colonial influence. The textbook highlights how traditional religions served as a form of resistance against colonial rule, with spiritual and magical interventions used to oppose European oppression. Notable examples include the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa and the Nyabingi cult in Uganda, which illustrate the resilience and adaptability of these practices. The emergence of new religious movements and independent churches blending traditional beliefs with Christianity further demonstrates the complexity and syncretism of African religious practices. Despite colonial efforts to suppress these practices, traditional beliefs persisted and adapted, as seen in the establishment of indigenous Christian churches and their continued role in providing social cohesion and spiritual guidance. Similarly, The African Times articles detail the staunch adherence to traditional gods by figures like the King of Porto Novo, who resisted European religious influence by rejecting new Christian denominations and maintaining complex indigenous practices, such as human sacrifices and societal enforcement of beliefs. The articles also highlight the enduring reliance on Fetish priests and traditional customs for justice, as seen in the Commandant of Badagry consulting a Fetish priest to solve a robbery, despite the presence of European colonial structures. Together, these observations underscore the enduring, multifaceted nature of indigenous religious practices in Africa amidst colonial pressures.

# The capture of Dahoman equipment and prisoners by the Egbas highlighted the scale of the Dahoman defeat and the strategic success of the Egba forces.

The claim that the capture of Dahoman equipment and prisoners by the Egbas highlighted the scale of the Dahoman defeat and the strategic success of the Egba forces is supported by observations from The African Times but not explicitly detailed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook discusses the Egba-Yoruba state of Abeokuta's resistance against Dahomey, noting the failure of Dahomey's direct attacks in 1851 and 1864 and the Egba's acquisition of European armaments, which aided in their defense. However, it does not provide specific details about the capture of Dahoman equipment or prisoners, nor does it emphasize the strategic success of the Egba forces in such terms. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed accounts supporting the claim, reporting that the Egbas captured between 1,000 and 2,000 prisoners along the road from Abeokuta to Ishagga and seized Dahoman equipment, including two cannons and several hundred muskets, many of which were new. The capture of the King's horse and other belongings further underscores the extent of the Dahoman defeat. These details from The African Times align with the claim by illustrating the strategic success of the Egbas in repelling the Dahoman attack and capturing valuable resources and personnel, thereby emphasizing the magnitude of the Dahoman loss. The absence of such specifics in the textbook highlights a difference in the portrayal of the events between the two sources.

# Religious beliefs have historically played a significant role in shaping the cultural and social dynamics of African societies.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant role religious beliefs have historically played in shaping the cultural and social dynamics of African societies. The textbook provides substantial evidence of how religions like Islam and Christianity introduced religious pluralism, leading to societal divisions and impacting social cohesion, while traditional African religions served as a unifying force, influencing worldviews, social structures, and cultural practices. It also highlights religion's role as a tool for resistance against colonial rule, with indigenous Christian churches and syncretic practices demonstrating religion's adaptability and enduring influence. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the personal dimension of faith, particularly faith in God through Christ, as a source of guidance, assurance, and resilience during difficult times. This perspective aligns with the claim by illustrating how religious beliefs influence individual behavior and community resilience, though it lacks a broader historical or cultural analysis of religion's impact on African societies. Together, these sources reveal the deep integration of religion into both personal and societal realms, highlighting its dual role in unifying and dividing communities, shaping cultural practices, and providing personal solace and moral guidance.

# The introduction of Christianity was seen as a necessary component for achieving moral regeneration and combating the evils present in Africa.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that the introduction of Christianity was seen as a necessary component for achieving moral regeneration and combating the evils present in Africa. The "General History of Africa" highlights the humanitarian and philanthropic zeal of evangelical Christianity among European policymakers during the conquest of Africa, driven by a missionary impulse aimed at the regeneration of African peoples. Missionaries were perceived as preparing the ground for colonialism, which was seen as a morally justified undertaking to redress the evils of the slave trade and stimulate economic opportunities. Christianity was associated with education, viewed as a means to elevate African societies, and efforts to stamp out African religion and culture were driven by the belief in the Christian God's exclusivity for salvation. However, the text also presents a nuanced view, noting the limited application of the missionary factor as a general theory of imperialism and acknowledging the negative impact on African culture. In parallel, The African Times articles emphasize the transformative power of Christianity in addressing moral and social issues, highlighting missionary labor's role in promoting true civilization and countering negative influences. Mr. Freeman's speech underscores Christianity's importance in eradicating superstition, paganism, and idolatry, portraying it as the sole remedy for societal maladies. The articles reflect a belief in Christianity's moral and civilizing mission, aligning with the claim that it was essential for moral regeneration in Africa, without presenting any refuting details. Together, these sources support the claim while also providing a complex picture of the interactions between Christianity and African societies.

# The spread of Christianity in Africa was often intertwined with colonial influences and missionary activities.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the spread of Christianity in Africa was often intertwined with colonial influences and missionary activities. The textbook provides substantial evidence by highlighting how missionaries acted as agents for European colonialism, facilitating European intervention and the spread of Christianity and western education under the peace and order established by colonial rule. It notes that missionaries received grants from colonial administrations to operate schools and were instrumental in creating an African class of evangelists and educated elites who often accepted colonialism. Additionally, missionary efforts were aligned with colonial goals, such as establishing a money economy and introducing commercial crops. The text also discusses the emergence of indigenous Christian churches as a response to colonialism, incorporating African beliefs into Christian practices, while Islam, seen as an indigenous religion, prospered under colonial rule due to its accommodation of African traditions. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the narrative of a Christian missionary advancing from the Cape of Good Hope into Southern Africa, emphasizing his message of love, brotherhood, and salvation. The articles portray the missionary's journey as peaceful and benevolent, without explicitly mentioning colonial influences, thus omitting the broader context of colonialism. However, they do suggest an economic dimension to the missionary's efforts by highlighting his role in initiating commercial enterprise, subtly nodding to colonial interests. Together, these sources illustrate the complex interplay between missionary activities, colonial influences, and the spread of Christianity in Africa, with the textbook providing a more explicit connection to colonialism than the articles.

# The spread of Christian civilization in Africa was seen as essential for overcoming what was perceived as the "ignorant barbarism" of heathen Africa.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the perception that the spread of Christian civilization in Africa was deemed essential for overcoming what was perceived as the "ignorant barbarism" of heathen Africa. The textbook highlights that missionaries often viewed African traditional practices and beliefs as inferior, referring to the African masses as "benighted people" and "noble savages." This perspective justified their efforts to introduce Christianity, education, capitalism, and industrialization as means to "civilize" Africa. The missionaries' negative attitude towards African religion and culture, and their determination to replace them with Christianity, further supports the claim. Additionally, the text notes that Christianity was associated with "civilization" and that missionaries believed it was their divine duty to bring salvation to Africans. However, it also acknowledges that African converts played a significant role in its expansion, and some African leaders saw value in the education and skills that missionaries could provide, indicating complex interactions and adaptations between missionaries and African societies. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the role of educated natives, influenced by Christian faith and principles, as indispensable in leading the charge against perceived ignorance and barbarism. The articles describe the efforts of religious and missionary societies, particularly the Church Missionary Society, in educating Africans and preparing them for "civilized usefulness." They argue that the spread of civilization, facilitated by education, is crucial for the moral and social transformation of Africa. Furthermore, the articles advocate for the British government to take responsibility for public education in West Africa, suggesting that the spread of civilization is not only a moral duty but also in the interest of British colonial rule. This aligns with the claim by portraying Christian civilization as a necessary force for overcoming perceived barbarism, while also highlighting the need for state involvement in education, suggesting a shift from solely missionary-led efforts to a more organized and state-supported approach, thus involving colonial governance in the civilizing mission.

# The introduction of Christianity in Africa was intertwined with European perceptions of religious duty and eschatology.

The introduction of Christianity in Africa was deeply intertwined with European perceptions of religious duty and eschatology, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights that missionaries felt a divine duty to spread Christianity, viewing it as the sole path to salvation, which reflects a strong eschatological motivation. They believed they were bringing Africans into the "arena of salvation and grace," indicating a religious duty to convert non-Christians. This sense of duty was particularly pronounced during the Scramble for Africa, where missionaries saw their work as morally justified, although the text notes that the missionary factor alone cannot explain imperialism, suggesting that religious duty was significant but not the sole driver of European actions. Similarly, The African Times articles support this claim by reflecting on the Christian duty to prepare the world for the return of the Saviour and the end of time, indicating a strong eschatological perspective. The articles emphasize the privilege and responsibility of spreading Christianity, highlighting a historical continuity from St. Augustine's mission to contemporary efforts in Africa. This suggests a sense of religious duty to transmit Christian teachings to regions considered "darker portions of the world," with the aim of civilizing and enlightening through Christianity. Together, these observations illustrate how the introduction of Christianity in Africa was perceived as a religious duty intertwined with eschatological beliefs, aligning with the claim.

# The belief was held that Christianity would prevail in Africa because it was divinely promised.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that Christianity's prevalence in Africa was divinely promised. The "General History of Africa" provides a nuanced view, emphasizing the role of missionaries—both European and African—in spreading Christianity through education, evangelism, and mission stations. It highlights the adaptation of Christianity with traditional African beliefs, leading to indigenous Christian movements, and discusses socio-political motivations behind missionary activities, such as European intervention and the introduction of a money economy. Notably, the text does not explicitly support the notion of a divine promise, suggesting instead that the spread of Christianity was driven by human agency and historical circumstances. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly support the claim, expressing a belief in Christianity's eventual prevalence in Africa due to divine promise. The articles convey a conviction that Christianity and its accompanying civilization are essential for healing Africa's woes, with figures like Captain John Hawley Glover expressing gratitude for being part of God's redemptive plan. They draw parallels between the Christianization of Great Britain and the anticipated Christianization of Africa, explicitly stating that Christianity "must prevail because He hath promised it." The articles also highlight the role of British officials and educated Africans in spreading Christianity, reinforcing the belief in its divine mandate and civilizing mission. Together, these sources illustrate a complex interplay of religious, cultural, and colonial dynamics, with The African Times aligning closely with the claim of a divine promise, while the "General History of Africa" presents a more human-centered narrative.

# The introduction of Christianity by missionaries was seen as a necessary remedy to the perceived moral and social ills in parts of Africa, such as human sacrifice and idolatry.

The introduction of Christianity by missionaries in parts of Africa was perceived as a necessary remedy to the perceived moral and social ills, such as human sacrifice and idolatry, as observed in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights that missionaries viewed African traditional practices as morally and socially inferior, aiming to replace them with Christian beliefs, which they considered the only true path to salvation. This perspective led to the condemnation of traditional practices, including rites of passage and cultural ceremonies, labeled as 'pagan.' However, the textbook also presents a nuanced picture, noting that Christianity did not entirely supplant traditional beliefs but sometimes supplemented them, resulting in syncretic religious expressions. Additionally, it discusses the role of Christianity in education and economic development, indicating that the missionary agenda extended beyond moral reform to broader social transformation. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly support the claim by emphasizing Christianity's transformative role in addressing moral decay and social challenges on the West Coast of Africa. The articles highlight the belief in Christianity's power to bring about moral regeneration and industrial development, portraying it as the sole effective solution to the social and moral challenges of the time. Both sources align in depicting Christianity as a corrective measure, though the textbook provides a more complex view of its impact on African societies.

# The spread of Christianity in Africa was seen as a duty and privilege of British officials, akin to the historical Christianization of Britain.

The spread of Christianity in Africa, as observed from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, presents a complex narrative involving European missionaries and colonial administrators. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced view, highlighting the role of European missionaries and colonial administrators in supporting missionary activities, including subsidizing mission schools. While it does not explicitly state that British officials saw the spread of Christianity as a duty and privilege akin to the Christianization of Britain, it suggests a level of institutional support for missionary efforts. The text also emphasizes the involvement of missionaries from various European countries and African converts, as well as the socio-political motivations intertwined with colonial interests. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly support the claim that British officials viewed the spread of Christianity as a duty and privilege, akin to the historical Christianization of Britain. The articles highlight the positive impact of British governance in Lagos, praising figures like Captain John Hawley Glover for their commitment to spreading the Gospel and civilization. They draw parallels between the Christianization of Britain and Africa, portraying British officials as instruments in God's plan for redemption, thus underscoring their perceived responsibility to promote Christianity. Together, these sources illustrate both the institutional support for missionary activities and the specific narrative of British officials' perceived duty in spreading Christianity, reflecting a blend of religious and colonial motivations.

# The introduction of Christianity in Africa was seen as a continuation of a historical mission that began with the conversion of European ancestors by missionaries like St. Augustine.

The introduction of Christianity in Africa is viewed through different lenses in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not explicitly link the conversion of European ancestors by early missionaries like St. Augustine to the later spread of Christianity in Africa. Instead, it highlights the 19th-century missionary zeal and evangelical revival in Europe, which spurred the spread of Christianity in Africa, driven by a sense of divine duty similar to early European Christianization efforts. This missionary activity is noted for its role in education and the establishment of a money economy, reflecting a continuation of the civilizing mission associated with early European Christianization, but without directly tracing a lineage from figures like St. Augustine. In contrast, The African Times explicitly supports the claim that the introduction of Christianity in Africa was perceived as a continuation of a historical mission that began with the conversion of European ancestors. The article draws a direct parallel between the early Christianization of Europe, specifically mentioning missionaries arriving in Britain 1,270 years ago, and the contemporary efforts to spread Christianity in Africa. It frames this as a privilege and responsibility, suggesting a sense of continuity and collective responsibility in this ongoing mission. Together, these perspectives provide a nuanced understanding of the historical and ideological connections perceived in the spread of Christianity from Europe to Africa.

# The development of railways and modern transportation infrastructure is crucial for the economic development and integration of Africa.

The development of railways and modern transportation infrastructure is a complex yet crucial factor for the economic development and integration of Africa, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the positive impacts of infrastructure development, such as reduced transport costs, facilitated movement of goods and people, and expanded export sectors in regions like Uganda, Nigeria, and South Africa. These advancements helped integrate African economies into the global market and reduced regional parochialism. However, the textbook also notes that the infrastructure primarily served colonial interests, focusing on connecting mineral-rich and cash crop-producing areas to ports for export, rather than promoting overall economic development or inter-African connectivity. This led to economic disparities and neglected regions without natural resources, often benefiting commercial firms and European settlers more than African producers. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the transformative impact of steamships and the potential for further development through railways, highlighting the rapid growth in trade and commerce along the Niger and Congo rivers. The articles suggest that railways could open up the interior, increase trade, and provide new outlets for manufactured goods, while also noting the moral and political benefits of such infrastructure. However, they reflect a colonial perspective, focusing on benefits to European powers and commerce. Together, these observations underscore the importance of transportation infrastructure in Africa's economic development, while also acknowledging the historical complexities and exploitative nature of its implementation during the colonial era.

# Africa's mineral wealth, including iron ore, presents significant opportunities for economic development as other regions exhaust their resources.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both acknowledge Africa's rich mineral wealth, including iron ore, and its potential for economic development, yet they offer different perspectives on the realization of this potential. The textbook provides a nuanced view, highlighting the historical complexities that have limited the economic benefits of Africa's mineral resources for local populations. It notes that while Africa is rich in minerals such as gold, diamonds, copper, and iron ore, the exploitation of these resources was largely controlled by foreign capital during the colonial period, with profits often repatriated. This resulted in limited infrastructure and industrial development that primarily benefited European settlers and foreign companies, leaving African economies vulnerable due to their reliance on monocultures and unprocessed exports. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the continent's abundant mineral resources, including some of the purest iron ore in the world, and support the claim that these resources present significant opportunities for economic development. However, the articles do not address the aspect of other regions exhausting their resources, which is a key component of the claim. While both sources recognize the potential of Africa's mineral wealth, the textbook underscores historical challenges that have hindered its full realization for African economic growth, whereas the articles focus on the current opportunities without discussing the comparative aspect of resource depletion elsewhere.

# The origin of the Nile River has been a major historical puzzle, attracting explorers and scientists for centuries.

The exploration of the Nile River's origin has been a significant historical puzzle, attracting explorers and scientists for centuries, as highlighted by The African Times. The articles explicitly mention that from the time of Cæsar to the explorations of Speke, the quest to uncover the Nile's source has been considered one of mankind's greatest puzzles, underscoring the long-standing intrigue and efforts dedicated to solving this geographical mystery. This aligns with the claim by emphasizing the historical and scientific importance attributed to these explorations. However, the General History of Africa textbook does not directly address this aspect of the Nile's history. Instead, it focuses on the historical and political developments in regions associated with the Nile, such as Sudan, Egypt, and the Horn of Africa, discussing challenges faced by colonizers, infrastructural developments, and the impact of colonial and nationalist movements. While the textbook mentions the Nile in the context of irrigation and agricultural modernization, it notably lacks specific references to exploration efforts aimed at discovering the river's source. This absence of information contrasts with the African Times articles, which corroborate the claim by acknowledging the historical fascination and challenges associated with uncovering the Nile's origin, despite not providing detailed outcomes of these explorations.

# The region around the equator, including the so-called "Mountains of the Moon," is described as one of the finest in the world due to its favorable climate and abundant vegetation.

The claim that the region around the equator, including the "Mountains of the Moon," is one of the finest in the world due to its favorable climate and abundant vegetation is supported by observations from The African Times but not explicitly corroborated by the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles describe the equatorial region as having a uniquely pleasant climate, largely due to its high altitude, which prevents excessive heat, allowing travelers like Captain Grant to comfortably wear woolen clothing and sleep under blankets. The articles also emphasize the area's rich and diverse ecosystem, with travelers Speke and Grant collecting 750 different specimens of vegetation, and highlight the natural beauty of inland seas fringed by tropical palms and snowy peaks. In contrast, the General History of Africa does not specifically mention the "Mountains of the Moon" or directly describe the equatorial region as exceptionally fine. Instead, it focuses on the Great Lakes region, part of the equatorial area, as densely populated and well-watered, with shared cultural and political characteristics. The textbook notes the diversity of vegetation and human impact on the environment in various regions, such as the northern Nguni area and the Sahara, suggesting a rich environment but not explicitly supporting the claim of the equatorial region's superior climate and vegetation. This absence of direct reference in the textbook contrasts with the detailed support found in The African Times articles.

# The persistence of the slave trade in Africa despite efforts to suppress it.

The persistence of the slave trade in Africa, despite efforts to suppress it, is well-documented in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the structural imbalances introduced by the abolition of the slave trade, such as the expansion of slavery in the Niger bend due to increased weapon costs, necessitating more slaves for trade. It discusses the inadequacy of treaties like the Hamerton Treaty in curtailing slave demand and the continued profitability of the trade from Zanzibar to the Gulf. The revival of slave-trading on the East coast during the 1860s and the operations in regions like Kaka, a major slave market, further illustrate this persistence. Western abolitionist efforts were ineffective in fully suppressing the trans-Saharan slave trade, which remained under African control, driven by economic motivations to avoid commercial chaos. Similarly, The African Times articles provide evidence of ongoing slave-trading activities along the West African coast, particularly in Quittah, Addah, and Whydah, where the trade thrived due to abandoned forts and insufficient British enforcement. The articles highlight the ineffectiveness of naval patrols, international political challenges like the use of the French flag by traders, and the Turkish government's complicity in the Eastern trade. They criticize the British government's failure to eradicate the trade, noting the persistence of slave markets in Morocco and the involvement of European powers. Together, these sources underscore the complex economic, political, and social factors that contributed to the enduring nature of the slave trade in Africa, despite external pressures to abolish it.

# The British colonial administration's ineffective efforts to suppress the slave trade.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the British colonial administration's ineffective efforts to suppress the slave trade. The textbook highlights several challenges, such as the British struggle to enforce treaties like the Hamerton Treaty of 1845 due to the sultan's reluctance and the vastness of his empire. British naval resources were inadequate, with warships often outmaneuvered by slave traders, who exploited legal loopholes and used false flags. The motivations of British sailors were also questioned, as they appeared more interested in capture bounties than the welfare of the slaves. Despite these efforts, the slave trade persisted well into the colonial period, with both British and local authorities unable to enforce decrees effectively. Complementing these insights, The African Times articles criticize the abandonment of Quittah Fort, which left the Acting Governor powerless to stop slave transactions due to insufficient resources. The British Admiralty was accused of paying for ships to prevent slave embarkations without genuine commitment to eradicating the trade. The articles also highlight the failure of British officials, such as Mr. Dumaresq and Lieutenant-Governor Lees, to take decisive action, with police inspections withdrawn and slave traders not prosecuted. Together, these details illustrate the British administration's inadequate and misdirected efforts, aligning with the claim of ineffectiveness in suppressing the slave trade.

# The involvement of multiple nations in the continuation of the slave trade.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that multiple nations were involved in the continuation of the slave trade. The textbook highlights the roles of countries such as France, the USA, Portugal, Brazil, and Britain, noting France's initial engagement in illicit slaving expeditions and the USA's evasion of serious commitments against the trade, with Southern planters even advocating for its legal reopening. Portugal and Brazil continued the illicit trade south of the Equator, with exportation levels sometimes as high as in the eighteenth century, while Spain's involvement is noted through Cuba as a significant destination for slave ships. Despite Britain's anti-slavery campaign, the trade persisted due to the slow response of other European states and the inadequacy of treaties like the Hamerton Treaty. The African Times articles further illustrate the multinational involvement, mentioning American, Portuguese, and French vessels in the trade, with the French flag being used to evade suppression. Portugal's purchase of slaves from the King of Dahomey and the use of a Portuguese gunboat for protection highlight its active participation. The complicity or negligence of foreign consuls and agents, including those from Turkey and Egypt, facilitated the trade, while the failure of European powers to declare the slave trade as piracy at the Berlin Conference underscores a lack of decisive action. Additionally, the involvement of Arab rulers in Zanzibar and the challenges faced by British forces near Pemba Island emphasize the complex international dynamics. Together, these sources demonstrate the persistent and widespread involvement of multiple nations in perpetuating the slave trade.

# The economic interests conflicting with moral obligations in the context of the slave trade.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the conflict between economic interests and moral obligations in the context of the slave trade. The textbook highlights the economic motivations behind the abolition of the slave trade, as argued by Eric Williams, who suggested that Britain's industrialization drove abolition more than humanitarian concerns. This is evidenced by the involvement of bankers in the abolitionist movement, indicating that the capitalist class had economic incentives to end the trade. The text also emphasizes the economic catastrophe the slave trade represented for Africa, with African distributors motivated to continue the trade due to a lack of viable alternatives. Resistance from planters, driven by the demand for slave-produced goods and the social prestige of slave ownership, further underscores the economic interests at play. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the complicity of various parties in perpetuating the slave trade due to economic incentives, such as sugar-planters in Johanna, including an Englishman and an American, who hire slaves for their plantations, thereby sustaining the demand for slave labor. The actions of individuals like Ali-bin-Omer, who capitalized on the trade for personal gain, further illustrate the prioritization of economic interests over moral considerations. The articles also criticize the indecision of British authorities, suggesting that political and economic considerations influenced their reluctance to act decisively against the trade. Together, these observations illustrate the complex interplay between economic interests and moral obligations, supporting the claim that economic factors often conflicted with humanitarian ideals in the context of the slave trade.

# The British government's failure to adequately address the slave trade in its territories.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the British government's efforts to address the slave trade in its territories. The General History of Africa acknowledges the British government's initiatives, such as the signing of treaties like the Hamerton Treaty of 1845 and the 1873 treaty with the Sultan of Zanzibar, and the establishment of naval squadrons and courts to try captured slave ships, indicating a concerted effort to combat the slave trade. However, it also highlights significant limitations, including the reluctance of local rulers to enforce treaties, inadequate naval resources, and the persistence of the slave trade despite British interventions. Furthermore, the textbook notes the British government's selective enforcement of anti-slavery policies in non-British territories that supplied British manufacturing interests, suggesting inconsistencies in their approach. Complementing this, The African Times articles emphasize the ongoing slave trade activities in British-controlled areas, such as the coast between Quittah and Whydah and the River Congo, despite the presence of British naval forces. The articles criticize the British Admiralty and local administrators for ineffective measures and a lack of decisive action, highlighting failures by officials like Mr. Dumaresq and Lieutenant-Governor Lees to enforce anti-slavery laws, allowing slave traders to operate with impunity. Additionally, the articles point out the disconnect between the British government's directives and actual enforcement on the ground. Together, these observations suggest that while the British government made efforts to suppress the slave trade, there were notable shortcomings and inconsistencies, supporting the claim of inadequate addressal.

# The role of international treaties and agreements in the context of the slave trade.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the role of international treaties and agreements in the context of the slave trade. The textbook highlights British efforts to abolish the slave trade through domestic legislation and bilateral treaties, such as the Anglo-Portuguese treaty of 1842 and the Hamerton Treaty of 1847, which aimed to suppress the trade by allowing the search and seizure of ships and banning the export of slaves from East Africa. These treaties were part of a broader strategy that included the establishment of mixed commissions to adjudicate captured slave ships. However, the effectiveness of these treaties varied, with some being described as inadequate or having little impact. The text also discusses the legitimacy of political treaties with African rulers, noting that many were legally indefensible or morally bankrupt, yet recognized under European diplomatic conventions. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the ineffectiveness of current efforts to suppress the slave trade, partly due to the lack of enforcement of existing treaties. They highlight the failure to make Spain fulfill its treaties, allowing the continuation of the slave trade to Cuba, and criticize the British Plenipotentiaries at the Berlin Congress for not supporting a declaration to classify the slave trade as piracy. The articles also point out the ongoing slave trade under the Turkish flag, despite treaties, and the need for a special treaty with Turkey. Both sources underscore that while international treaties and agreements are crucial tools in combating the slave trade, their effectiveness is often undermined by inadequate enforcement and lack of international cooperation, illustrating the complex role these treaties played in efforts to regulate and eventually abolish the slave trade.

# The British military and naval efforts against the slave trade being seen as ineffective or misdirected.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles converge on the claim that British military and naval efforts against the slave trade were seen as ineffective or misdirected. The General History of Africa highlights the British Admiralty's initial lack of enthusiasm and inadequate resources, such as warships ill-suited for the task, which contributed to the ineffectiveness of their efforts. British sailors, motivated by a power complex and capture bounties, sometimes engaged in illegal seizures, leading to high mortality among captured slaves, further indicating misdirection. The ability of slave ships to evade British cruisers and the limited impact of treaties like the Hamerton Treaty underscore the ineffectiveness of British actions. The British naval presence on the West African coast often resulted in increased violence and punitive expeditions rather than effective suppression, with efforts sometimes more focused on maintaining political influence and economic interests than genuine humanitarian concerns. Similarly, The African Times articles express disappointment over the continued existence of the slave trade on the West Coast of Africa, despite the resources and efforts supposedly directed towards its eradication. The articles criticize the British Admiralty and naval squadron for failing to prevent slave embarkations, suggesting a focus on repression rather than destruction of the trade. They also highlight the inefficacy of British administrators, such as Mr. Dumaresq, in enforcing anti-slavery laws, and the failure of British Plenipotentiaries at the Berlin Congress to support a declaration of the slave trade as piracy, which would have empowered international efforts. Together, these observations underscore a pattern of inadequate enforcement, misallocation of resources, and missed opportunities for stronger international collaboration, supporting the claim that British efforts were often ineffective and misdirected.

# The persistence of slavery as a social institution despite official prohibitions.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the persistence of slavery as a social institution despite official prohibitions. The textbook highlights that even after Britain's abolition of the slave trade in 1807, slavery continued to expand in regions like the Niger bend due to economic factors, such as the rising cost of weapons necessitating the exchange of more slaves. Domestic slavery persisted across Africa and the Americas, with slaves integrated into social structures as sources of production and progeny. The demand for slave labor in agricultural and domestic settings, coupled with resistance from planters who opposed abolition due to economic interests and racial stereotypes, further illustrates this persistence. In regions like the Western and Central Sudan, the slave trade created a permanent crisis, leading to states dependent on its continuation. Social and legal structures in Afro-American societies were shaped by slavery, with distinctions between free and enslaved individuals persisting post-abolition. Similarly, The African Times articles reveal systemic complicity in the slave trade, with local authorities in Mourzouk, such as the Kaimakan, financially benefiting from it despite its illegality. European powers' efforts to curb the trade were ineffective, limited to coastal areas, leaving the interior unchecked. The ongoing demand for African slaves in countries like Turkey, Egypt, and Persia, where slavery was ingrained as a social institution, perpetuated the trade. The British government's failure to address the issue at the Berlin Congress and the continued existence of slavery within British territories, such as the Gold Coast, further illustrate the persistence of slavery due to systemic complicity, ineffective enforcement, and enduring demand. Together, these observations highlight the complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors that allowed slavery to persist as a social institution despite official prohibitions.

# The British military presence in Africa was ineffective and became a source of ridicule rather than intimidation.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present a multifaceted view of the British military presence in Africa, highlighting both effectiveness and challenges. The General History of Africa provides examples of British military successes, such as the decisive defeat of the Asante in 1874, the annexation of Asante in 1901, and the conquest of Nigeria, demonstrating their capability to achieve strategic objectives and maintain colonial dominance. However, it also notes challenges like war-weariness, insecurity, and reliance on African troops, suggesting limitations in their operations and indicating that their presence was not always straightforwardly intimidating. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the ineffectiveness and ridicule associated with the British military presence. They describe a scenario where 500 men of the 4th and 2nd W.I. Regiments were left without expected support from an auxiliary native force, highlighting a failure in strategy and planning. The articles point out that sickness posed a greater threat than enemy action, with many soldiers falling ill, and reinforcements arriving too late, underscoring mismanagement. This situation reportedly made the British a "laughing stock" to both the Ashantees and their own people, with ineffective leadership and a lack of agreement between civil and military powers further contributing to their failures. Together, these sources paint a complex picture of the British military presence in Africa, marked by both strategic successes and significant challenges that sometimes led to ridicule.

# The British military presence in Africa was plagued by mismanagement, leading to unnecessary sickness and death among troops.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the claim that the British military presence in Africa was plagued by mismanagement, leading to unnecessary sickness and death among troops. The General History of Africa highlights the high mortality rates among European soldiers compared to African soldiers due to their susceptibility to indigenous diseases, pointing to a lack of adequate medical preparation and understanding of tropical diseases. It also describes poor sanitary conditions in labor camps, contributing to the spread of diseases like dysentery and venereal diseases, and notes the inadequate medical infrastructure, with a low ratio of doctors to the population, suggesting neglect for military personnel. Additionally, the text mentions forced recruitment and harsh conditions faced by laborers and carriers, indicating logistical mismanagement. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles detail the arrival of the troop-ship Tamar with 700 men who were exposed to disease and fell sick at the river Prah, criticizing the decision to keep troops in vulnerable locations. The articles also highlight the unexpected departure of Governor Pine, leaving leadership in the hands of the Chief Justice, and the ineffective use of 200 Cape Coast Volunteers, suggesting resource misallocation. Furthermore, Lord Carnarvon's speech criticizes the reduction of West India regiments, better suited for the climate, in favor of English troops who were more vulnerable to harsh conditions. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of mismanagement and its detrimental impact on the health and effectiveness of the British military forces in Africa.

# The British underestimated the complexity and cost of their military efforts in Africa, leading to unexpected challenges and outcomes.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the British underestimated the complexity and cost of their military efforts in Africa, leading to unexpected challenges and outcomes. The General History of Africa highlights several instances where British military prestige suffered due to miscalculations of the challenges posed by African polities. For example, the British were forced to withdraw from Moshoeshoe's kingdom after facing stiff resistance, and during the Anglo-Xhosa war of 1850-3, they struggled to suppress resistance, relying heavily on local allies due to insufficient support from Cape Colony white farmers. The text also notes the British abandonment of expansionist policies in South Africa due to the high costs of maintaining control and the logistical challenges during the First World War, which included a significant exodus of European administrative personnel from Africa, slowing down essential services. While the textbook does not explicitly state that the British underestimated these challenges, it provides ample evidence of the unexpected difficulties and costs they encountered. Complementing this, The African Times articles echo this narrative, with Lord Carnarvon's speech highlighting the costly nature of "little wars" and their unsatisfactory outcomes, indicating a miscalculation of their scale. He also regrets the reduction of West India regiments, which were better suited for the climate, leading to increased illness and death among English troops who were less adapted to the conditions. The articles further mention delays and the impending rainy season, underscoring the unexpected logistical and environmental challenges faced by the British. Together, these sources paint a consistent picture of British misjudgment in their military endeavors in Africa.

# The presence of British naval power was considered necessary to influence native disputes and protect commercial interests.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that British naval power was considered necessary to influence native disputes and protect commercial interests. The General History of Africa details how British naval actions, such as the annexation of Lagos and interventions in Porto Novo, were pivotal in establishing British influence and safeguarding commercial interests. The presence of British naval power is highlighted as a tool for negotiating favorable conditions for British traders and missionaries, particularly in the Bight of Bonny and Calabar, with gunboat diplomacy being used to enforce treaties and collect trade debts. Additionally, the British Preventive Naval Squadron played a significant role in stopping the slave trade and increasing British influence in Calabar. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the necessity of a strong British naval presence, noting the region's vulnerability following the death of Consul Hopkins and the inadequacy of sending only a gunboat without consular authority. The articles recall a time when a more substantial naval force, including the Commodore and several ships, was available, underscoring the belief that such a presence was essential for maintaining order and protecting trade. The urgent call for a new Consul further highlights the perceived importance of British naval and consular authority in resolving disputes and safeguarding commercial interests. Together, these sources illustrate the critical role of British naval power in managing native disputes and protecting commercial interests in Africa.

# The Emancipation Proclamation was a strategic move by President Lincoln to weaken the Confederate states by freeing their slaves.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times articles provide complementary perspectives on the claim that the Emancipation Proclamation was a strategic move by President Lincoln to weaken the Confederate states by freeing their slaves. While the textbook does not explicitly discuss the Emancipation Proclamation or Lincoln's strategic intentions, it offers context on the broader anti-slavery movements and political dynamics surrounding slavery in the United States. It mentions the American Civil War and the Lincoln administration's commitment to the right of search, part of broader efforts to suppress the slave trade, suggesting that the abolition of slavery was intertwined with political and military strategies. This context aligns with the claim about the strategic nature of the Emancipation Proclamation, although the textbook does not directly address Lincoln's motivations or the specific impact on the Confederate states. In contrast, The African Times article explicitly supports the claim, stating that the proclamation was issued as a "fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion," targeting the Confederacy by applying only to states in rebellion against the United States. It highlights that the proclamation conferred freedom on slaves in states that no longer acknowledged the Federal Government, aligning with the claim of using emancipation as a tool to weaken the Confederacy. The article also notes the selective application of the proclamation, as slaves in Union-loyal states were retained in their bonds, underscoring its strategic nature rather than a universal moral stance against slavery. Together, these sources suggest that while the textbook provides a broader context, The African Times offers direct support for the interpretation of the proclamation as a strategic move.

# The North was willing to accept slavery if it meant maintaining the Union.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the claim that the North was willing to accept slavery if it meant maintaining the Union. The General History of Africa does not directly address this claim, focusing instead on the international aspects of the slave trade, abolitionist movements, and the economic and political dynamics surrounding slavery in Africa, Europe, and the Americas. It highlights the complexities of international diplomacy and economic interests, but does not delve into the specific internal political dynamics of the United States, particularly the North's stance on slavery in relation to maintaining the Union. This absence suggests a focus on the global context of slavery rather than specific political compromises within the U.S. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by emphasizing that the North's primary focus during the Civil War was the preservation of the Union rather than the abolition of slavery. The articles assert that the North would accept a Union with slavery as its cornerstone rather than allow the formation of two separate nations, driven by motives such as maintaining high tariffs, monopolizing manufacturing and trade, and forming a powerful confederation, with slavery being an incidental issue. This perspective aligns with the claim, highlighting a significant similarity between the articles' content and the notion that the North was willing to accept slavery to ensure the Union's preservation.

# The British blockade of the Dahomey coast was a strategic move to exert control and enforce compliance, impacting the region economically.

The claim that the British blockade of the Dahomey coast was a strategic move to exert control and enforce compliance, impacting the region economically, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences in emphasis. The General History of Africa does not explicitly mention a British blockade of the Dahomey coast, but it does highlight British and French involvement in the region, particularly concerning the abolition of the slave trade and the shift to 'legitimate' trade. The textbook discusses the British anti-slave trade squadron's actions, such as the bombardment of Lagos in 1851, and the use of treaties and naval power by British consuls to secure favorable conditions for British traders, indicating a broader strategy of exerting control that had economic impacts. In contrast, The African Times provides specific details supporting the claim, noting that the blockade was officially proclaimed by Commodore Hewett and maintained by a competent force of British ships, underscoring a strategic military presence. The articles report that trade on the coast suffered, with bad trade conditions and dull business activities, highlighting the economic impact. Furthermore, the blockade was tied to demands on the King of Dahomey, who was expected to pay a fine for its lifting, reinforcing the notion of exerting control and enforcing compliance. The King’s lack of response and rumors of potential military operations against him suggest ongoing tensions and strategic considerations. However, the articles do not delve into the broader geopolitical or economic strategies behind the blockade, which could be an area of interest for historians. This synthesis of sources reveals a complex picture of British actions in Dahomey, with The African Times providing more direct evidence of a blockade than the textbook, which focuses on broader regional dynamics.

# The British imposed economic penalties on African kingdoms, such as Dahomey, to exert control and influence over the region.

The claim that the British imposed economic penalties on African kingdoms, such as Dahomey, to exert control and influence over the region is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with differing emphases. The General History of Africa provides a broader context of British economic and political strategies in West Africa, such as the transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, the signing of treaties with local rulers, and the use of gunboat diplomacy to enforce British interests. It discusses the economic impact of British colonial policies, including tariffs and banking systems favoring British interests, but does not provide direct evidence of economic penalties specifically targeting Dahomey. Instead, it highlights Dahomey's adjustment to changing economic conditions, like the shift to palm oil trade, without attributing this to British-imposed penalties. In contrast, The African Times articles offer specific evidence supporting the claim, detailing a fine of 500 puncheons of palm oil, valued at £6,000, imposed on the King of Dahomey, with a deadline for payment. This fine represents an economic penalty, and the King's refusal to pay, coupled with his invitation to the Commodore to Abomey, offering payment in "powder and bullets" instead, underscores resistance to British demands and highlights the tension and control dynamics. The presence of British war-vessels off Whydah and the potential blockade of the port further indicate British efforts to enforce compliance and exert influence. While the articles do not explicitly state the broader strategic intentions behind these actions, they provide evidence of economic penalties imposed by the British, supporting the claim of exerting influence over African kingdoms like Dahomey.

# The British viewed the actions of the Dahomian kings as incompatible with the development of a civilized society in Africa.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the British views regarding the actions of the Dahomian kings. The textbook does not explicitly address British perceptions of the Dahomian kings or their compatibility with the development of a civilized society in Africa. Instead, it focuses on interactions between the British and various African states, such as the Yoruba, Benin, and the Niger Delta, within the broader context of colonialism and African resistance. This absence of specific information on Dahomey suggests a notable gap in the narrative regarding British colonial attitudes. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed support for the claim that the British viewed the actions of the Dahomian kings as incompatible with the development of a civilized society. The articles express strong disapproval of Dahomian practices like human sacrifice and slave-hunting, labeling them as barbarous and hindrances to civilization. They urge the British government to intervene, arguing that these actions prevent commerce, hinder civilization, and create misery, which are incompatible with the nascent civilization in Africa. The Dahomian king is depicted in derogatory terms, emphasizing the view of his actions as savage and uncivilized. Overall, while the textbook lacks specific insights into British views on Dahomey, The African Times articles align with the claim by portraying the Dahomian kings' actions as obstacles to progress and development in Africa.

# The British aimed to impose Western notions of civilization and humanity on African societies, often through strategic colonial negotiations and expansion.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the British aimed to impose Western notions of civilization and humanity on African societies through strategic colonial negotiations and expansion. The General History of Africa highlights the British use of treaties, diplomacy, and military force to establish control over African territories, such as in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Nigeria. This involved indirect rule, where African authorities were integrated into the colonial administration in a subordinate capacity, reflecting a strategic governance approach that maintained some local structures while imposing Western systems. The British interest in abolishing the slave trade and promoting legitimate trade further aligns with their civilizing mission. However, the textbook also notes that British colonial policy varied across regions, influenced by practical considerations like the availability of European personnel and the need for indigenous cooperation, indicating that imposing Western civilization was not a uniform objective. Complementing this, The African Times articles discuss a reported agreement between the Portuguese and British governments, where Portugal ceded rights in Whydah in exchange for British acknowledgment of Portuguese sovereignty over territories at the River Congo's mouth. This negotiation is portrayed as a means to bring the trans-Volta seaboard under British authority, justified as a civilizing mission to address the "evils" of the Dahomian monarchy, such as ending "abominable massacres." These articles reinforce the notion that British colonial ambitions were often framed as efforts to bring civilization and humanity to African societies, aligning with the broader strategic objectives outlined in the textbook.

# The opening of the Ashanti interior was seen as a way to replace war with commerce, benefiting both local and British interests.

The observations from the *General History of Africa* textbook and *The African Times* news articles provide a multifaceted view of the claim that the opening of the Ashanti interior was seen as a way to replace war with commerce, benefiting both local and British interests. The *General History of Africa* highlights the British government's recognition of the economic potential of their African colonies, emphasizing commerce and the application of British capital, which aligns with the claim that commerce was prioritized. It also notes British efforts to establish 'legitimate trade' as a substitute for the slave trade, suggesting a shift from conflict to economic activities. However, the text primarily focuses on British economic interests and the imposition of British law and order to facilitate resource exploitation, rather than mutual benefits, presenting a nuanced view that partially supports the claim. In contrast, *The African Times* articles from the *Daily News* and *Daily Telegraph* strongly support the claim, expressing hope that British military action would replace "perpetual and sanguinary war" with trade, leading to immense and profitable traffic. They predict that opening the interior will benefit commerce, with old war-paths becoming routes for dealers, and emphasize the role of British soldiers as pioneers of civilization. These articles reflect a colonial perspective, highlighting the anticipated mutual benefits of commerce and peace, although they notably do not mention the African Times news articles, suggesting a lack of direct support from that source. Together, these observations illustrate a complex interplay of interests, with the *General History of Africa* emphasizing British advantages and *The African Times* portraying a more optimistic view of mutual benefits through commerce.

# The French public and government were largely indifferent or unaware of the reasons behind the conflict with Dahomey, indicating a disconnect between colonial actions and metropolitan oversight.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim regarding the French public and government's awareness of the conflict with Dahomey. The General History of Africa highlights that the French conquest was initiated by specific incidents, such as the firing upon the French gunboat Topaz by Fon soldiers, which prompted military action. This suggests that the French government was not entirely indifferent, as evidenced by the involvement of military figures like Colonel Dodds and strategic decisions during the conflict, indicating a level of governmental oversight. However, the textbook does not explicitly address the level of awareness or concern among the French public, leaving a gap in understanding public sentiment. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim of indifference and unawareness, noting that the French nation showed little interest in the war, as it failed to become a topic of party controversy. The articles further suggest a disconnect between colonial actions and metropolitan oversight, with the French Ministry reportedly knowing little more about the conflict than the general public. The popular belief that military forces were merely seeking to alleviate monotony by picking a quarrel underscores the lack of clear communication from the government. Together, these sources highlight a significant gap between the actions in the colonies and the understanding or interest of the metropolitan authorities and public, aligning with the claim of indifference and unawareness.

# The situation in West Africa highlighted the broader challenges faced by European colonial powers, as evidenced by the French conflict with Dahomey.

The situation in West Africa underscored the broader challenges faced by European colonial powers, as exemplified by the French conflict with Dahomey. The General History of Africa textbook details the French policy of military conquest in the region, which often provoked militant resistance from African rulers like Behanzin of Dahomey, who mobilized his troops and modernized his army to defend his state's sovereignty. This resistance was fueled by the imposition of foreign rule, which was intolerable to the Islamized societies in the area. The textbook highlights the French conflict with Dahomey as a significant example of this resistance, illustrating the widespread revolts and protests against colonial rule in West Africa, particularly exacerbated during the First World War. These revolts demonstrated the logistical and military disadvantages faced by West African states, such as outdated weaponry and lack of alliances, ultimately leading to their defeat. The African Times article complements this by describing Dahomey as a "standing menace" to the peace of West Africa, affecting both British and French interests, and notes that the French were "forced into a war with Dahomey." The article also discusses trade disruptions and the need for careful colonial governance, reflecting the complexities faced by European powers in managing their colonial interests. Together, these sources support the claim by detailing the resistance and challenges encountered by European colonial powers in West Africa, particularly in the context of the French conflict with Dahomey.

# The British colonial justice system in Lagos was biased in favor of Europeans, often failing to hold them accountable for their actions against Africans.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively highlight the perceived bias in the British colonial justice system in Lagos, favoring Europeans and often failing to hold them accountable for their actions against Africans. The General History of Africa provides context by noting that European judicial institutions introduced during colonization were primarily focused on punishing the guilty rather than redressing the aggrieved, suggesting a bias towards maintaining colonial order. It also mentions a dyarchical judicial arrangement where civil litigation involving Africans adhered to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law involving Europeans fell under colonial jurisdiction, potentially leading to biased outcomes. However, the textbook lacks specific details about Lagos or explicit examples of Europeans not being held accountable. In contrast, The African Times articles provide concrete instances supporting the claim. One article describes how two Europeans who assaulted Mr. Cole, a colored gentleman, faced minimal consequences, with the acting police magistrate initially advising a private settlement. Another article highlights skepticism about the significant consequences for a European book-keeper imprisoned for raping a young child, amid concerns of potential bribery or witness intimidation. A third article recounts an incident where Mr. Goldsworthy, a high-ranking official, assaulted an African subordinate without facing immediate repercussions, underscoring the perceived impunity of Europeans in authority. These articles illustrate a pattern of leniency and bias in the colonial justice system, aligning with the claim, despite the textbook's lack of specific examples from Lagos.

# There was skepticism and criticism regarding the authenticity and accuracy of reports from European explorers and missionaries in Africa.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights that align with the claim of skepticism and criticism regarding the authenticity and accuracy of reports from European explorers and missionaries in Africa. The textbook highlights the cultural chauvinism and racism prevalent among Europeans during the colonial period, which likely influenced their perceptions and reports about Africa. It notes that European missionaries and explorers often acted as agents of colonialism, promoting European interests and undermining African cultures, suggesting that their reports may have been biased or incomplete. Furthermore, the text criticizes the Eurocentric views of African history, which dismissed pre-colonial African achievements and cultures, indicating a broader skepticism about the accuracy of European narratives. However, it does not explicitly discuss skepticism or criticism directed at specific reports, highlighting a gap in the discussion related to the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles provide more direct evidence of skepticism and criticism. One article criticizes "Professor" William Grant Milne for his lack of knowledge and one-sidedness, labeling him an "incompetent and self-sufficient ignoramus," which indicates skepticism about his credibility and understanding of African cultures. It also questions the accuracy of Milne's geographical knowledge, implying a lack of trust in his reports. Another article highlights the disadvantages faced by educated Africans due to European influence, suggesting that European interests often overshadowed African voices. This reflects a critical stance towards European explorers and missionaries, questioning the authenticity and accuracy of their reports. Together, these sources illustrate a broader skepticism towards European narratives and their impact on African societies.

# The economic exploitation of African resources, such as gold, palm-oil, and camwood, was driven by colonial merchants rather than benefiting local populations.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide evidence supporting the claim that the economic exploitation of African resources, such as gold, palm-oil, and camwood, was driven by colonial merchants rather than benefiting local populations. The textbook offers substantial evidence by highlighting how mining and agricultural industries were established with foreign capital, with profits repatriated to benefit shareholders abroad instead of local African communities. It describes legislative measures that granted monopolies to imperialist interests, systematically excluding Africans from participating in lucrative industries like diamond mining, and imposing regulations that minimized African involvement. The colonial economy was structured to serve the interests of colonizing powers, turning African states into markets for European manufactured goods while neglecting local industrialization. This resulted in an exploitative economic system where Africans were compelled to produce cash crops for export, leading to malnutrition and famine. The African Times articles further align with this claim by detailing how colonial merchants orchestrated trade dynamics, such as in Accra, where imports like rum and gin were exchanged for exports like palm oil and rubber, often through bartering. This indicates a system controlled by colonial merchants, although the articles do not explicitly discuss the direct impact on local populations. Together, these sources illustrate the exploitative nature of colonial economic practices that prioritized the interests of colonial merchants over the welfare of local African populations.

# The belief that British enterprise was a positive force for industrial and civilizational development was prevalent, despite acknowledging its faults and errors.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that British enterprise was a positive force for industrial and civilizational development in Africa. The General History of Africa acknowledges the development of infrastructure and modern agricultural systems in Sudan as positive outcomes of British colonial policy, aligning with the claim. However, it emphasizes that these developments primarily served British interests, with infrastructure being inadequate for the Sudanese and industrialization neglected. The textbook critiques British colonialism for economic exploitation and neglect of regions like Southern Sudan, highlighting the prioritization of imperial interests over local development and the structuring of colonial economies to benefit Britain through raw material extraction and trade restrictions. This critical perspective contrasts with the claim by underscoring the exploitative nature of British enterprise and its limited focus on genuine civilizational development. Meanwhile, The African Times articles express a belief in the positive impact of British enterprise, describing it as a "mighty vivifying influence" that invigorated "industrial humanity everywhere," supporting the claim. However, they also acknowledge a sense of "national humiliation" due to the diminishing role of British action compared to foreign efforts, suggesting a nuanced view that recognizes both benefits and shortcomings. Additionally, the articles critique European behavior in Africa, implying that the civilizing mission was not uniformly positive or effective. Together, these sources reflect a belief in the potential benefits of British enterprise while acknowledging its faults, offering a more layered understanding of its role in Africa.

# The involvement of European figures like Mr. Stanley and Major Barttelot in Africa highlights the era's imperialistic endeavors and the complex interactions with local African leaders such as Tippoo Tib.

The involvement of European figures like Mr. Stanley and Major Barttelot in Africa during the imperialistic era is highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, though with varying emphases. The General History of Africa provides details on H. M. Stanley's role, employed by the African International Association to explore the Congo, aligning with King Leopold's imperialistic ambitions that led to the creation of the Congo Free State. This supports the claim of European involvement in Africa during this period. However, the textbook does not mention Major Barttelot or his interactions with local African leaders such as Tippoo Tib, though it does discuss the complex interactions between Europeans and African leaders, including Tippu Tib's alliance with the Congo Free State, indicating the intricate relationships and strategic alliances formed. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details on both Mr. Stanley and Major Barttelot, describing Stanley's expeditions and conflicts with local tribes like the Watura, and Barttelot's assassination by his carriers, highlighting the perilous and contentious nature of these interactions. The articles also reference Tippoo Tib, suggesting complex dynamics and negotiations between European explorers and local authorities. However, they do not explicitly discuss the broader imperialistic motives or political implications, focusing instead on immediate events and challenges. Together, these sources underscore the era's imperialistic endeavors and the complex interactions between European figures and African leaders, though with differing levels of detail and emphasis on specific individuals and broader motives.

# The kingdom of Whydah was an independent entity with a distinct culture and language from Dahomey before its conquest.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the claim that the kingdom of Whydah was an independent entity with a distinct culture and language from Dahomey before its conquest. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information supporting Whydah's independence or cultural distinctiveness, focusing instead on the broader cultural and political dynamics of the Aja-speaking peoples, including the Fon, Gun, and Ewe, and their interactions with neighboring cultures like the Yoruba, Borgu, and Edo. It discusses Dahomey's historical context, including its interactions with European powers and economic transitions, but does not explicitly address Whydah's status as a separate entity. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim, stating that Whydah was an independent kingdom with a distinct population and language, different from those of Dahomey. The articles highlight Whydah's efforts to prevent Dahomey from communicating with coastal natives and Europeans, underscoring its independence and distinctiveness. They also recount the Whydah's reliance on a fetish for protection during Dahomey's conquest, emphasizing cultural differences. However, the articles lack specific details about Whydah's cultural practices or language, which would interest historians. Overall, while the textbook does not emphasize Whydah's distinct identity, The African Times aligns with the claim by affirming its independence and distinctiveness prior to Dahomey's conquest.

# Whydah's strategy to limit Dahomey's access to firearms by selling incomplete guns was a significant factor in their eventual downfall.

The claim that Whydah's strategy of selling incomplete guns to limit Dahomey's access to firearms was a significant factor in their eventual downfall is supported by observations from The African Times but not mentioned in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles detail how Whydah sold guns to Dahomey without essential components, misleading them about the true functionality of firearms and requiring two men to operate each gun. This deception was intended to keep Dahomey unaware of the full potential of firearms. However, the strategy backfired when a Dahoman acquired a complete musket at Little Popo, revealing the Whydah trick and prompting Dahomey to declare war on Whydah. This incident is portrayed as pivotal, leading to Dahomey's conquest of Whydah, which was so unexpected that Whydah offered no resistance. In contrast, the General History of Africa does not mention this specific strategy but discusses other factors contributing to Dahomey's military challenges, such as the technical superiority of European weapons, the lack of a unified West African alliance, and logistical difficulties in acquiring modern arms due to international agreements like the Brussels Convention. The textbook also notes Dahomey's efforts to modernize its army by purchasing firearms and artillery from German firms, indicating that access to firearms was not entirely restricted. The absence of any mention of Whydah's strategy in the textbook suggests a divergence between the claim and the historical account provided in the text, while The African Times supports the narrative that this strategy contributed to Whydah's downfall.

# The reliance of the Whydah people on a fetish, rather than military defense, contributed to their swift defeat by Dahomey.

The claim that the reliance of the Whydah people on a fetish, rather than military defense, contributed to their swift defeat by Dahomey is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information about the Whydah people's reliance on a fetish or their military defense strategies in relation to their defeat by Dahomey. Instead, it focuses on the broader historical context of the region, including the rise and fall of empires such as Old Oyo and Dahomey, socio-political dynamics, and European interventions. While it discusses military actions and political maneuvers of various states, it does not mention Whydah's cultural practices or defense mechanisms, neither supporting nor refuting the claim directly. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing how the Whydah people placed their trust in a great fetish, symbolized by a very fat bull, to protect them from the Dahoman army. This reliance led them to neglect active military defense, believing the fetish would stop the enemy. Consequently, the Dahoman army faced no opposition and advanced easily, leading to Whydah's defeat. The articles emphasize the Whydah's surprise and lack of resistance, aligning with the claim that their cultural beliefs, rather than military strategy, played a significant role in their downfall.

# The story of Whydah's defeat highlights the role of cultural beliefs and misunderstandings in historical conflicts.

The claim that the story of Whydah's defeat highlights the role of cultural beliefs and misunderstandings in historical conflicts is supported by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit in different ways. While the textbook does not specifically mention Whydah or its defeat, it explores the broader theme of cultural beliefs and misunderstandings in various African resistances against colonial powers. It highlights how religious ideologies, both African and introduced, played significant roles in resistance movements, often leading to misunderstandings between indigenous peoples and colonial forces. This context of cultural beliefs and misunderstandings is relevant to the claim, though it does not directly address Whydah. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically focus on Whydah's defeat, illustrating how cultural beliefs and misunderstandings were pivotal in this historical conflict. The articles describe the Whydahs' reliance on a cultural belief in a "great fetish," symbolized by a very fat bull, to protect them from the Dahoman army, which led to their lack of practical military resistance and eventual defeat. Additionally, a misunderstanding involving the sale of incomplete guns to the Dahomans, which was a strategic deception by the Whydahs, further exemplifies the role of misunderstandings. This deception was uncovered when a Dahoman acquired a complete musket elsewhere, leading to a cause for war. Together, these observations underscore the significant impact of cultural beliefs and misunderstandings in the conflict between Whydah and Dahomey, aligning with the claim.

# The success of the Church Missionary Society in Africa suggests that African agents are crucial for the effective spread of Christianity on the continent.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles strongly support the claim that African agents were crucial for the effective spread of Christianity on the continent, particularly in relation to the Church Missionary Society (CMS). The General History of Africa highlights the significant role of African converts, catechists, and ministers in zealously spreading Christianity beyond their ethnic groups, with examples such as evangelists from Buganda and the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, working in the Niger valley. The CMS is noted for establishing educational institutions like Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone, which were instrumental in spreading Western education and Christianity, often supported by local African initiatives. This widespread influence was facilitated by African participation, as schools were set up not only on the coast but also in inland towns. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize that the CMS's success is attributed to its stations being filled with young African men they trained, including ministers, deacons, catechists, and schoolmasters, who were sent into the heart of Africa to teach and preach the Gospel. This approach contrasts with the Wesleyan Missionary Society, which is criticized for not utilizing its trained African youths, leading to a lack of African agents in their mission work. The articles further note that the Gospel spread more swiftly when the Bight of Benin was overseen by an African Bishop, underscoring the effectiveness of African agents in mission work. Together, these sources illustrate the significant contributions of African agents in the success of missionary activities, including those of the CMS, in Africa.

# The challenges faced by missionaries in Africa were exacerbated by the harsh climate, illness, and theft by the local population.

The claim that missionaries in Africa faced challenges exacerbated by harsh climate, illness, and theft by the local population is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not directly link these specific challenges to the experiences of missionaries. Instead, it discusses broader hardships in Africa, such as famines, diseases, and social upheavals, without explicitly connecting them to missionary work. The only mention of missionaries is in the context of their contributions to the medical field, such as operating hospitals and leprosariums, without detailing any specific adversities they faced. In contrast, The African Times articles provide several details supporting the claim, highlighting the "destructive effects of climate," "interruptions occasioned by illness," and "thefts of the native population" as significant challenges. The articles also emphasize the immense difficulties in traveling and transporting goods due to geographical obstacles, such as "two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids," and the high cost and difficulty of procuring carriers. These details underscore the severe environmental and logistical challenges that compounded the missionaries' efforts, aligning with the claim and suggesting a consistent narrative of adversity during this period. The articles do not offer any information that refutes the claim or mention mitigating factors, further supporting the narrative of challenges faced by missionaries in Africa.

---

# The efforts of missionaries in Africa were characterized by perseverance and dedication, driven by their religious convictions rather than the pursuit of recognition or reward.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the efforts of missionaries in Africa, highlighting both their perseverance and the complexity of their motivations. The General History of Africa acknowledges the missionaries' commitment to evangelization and education, as evidenced by their establishment of schools and mission stations, which aligns with the claim of perseverance driven by religious convictions. However, it also complicates this narrative by revealing that missionaries often acted as agents of European colonialism, consciously paving the way for colonial intervention, and displaying negative attitudes towards African religion and culture. This suggests motivations beyond purely religious convictions, involving cultural imperialism and colonial interests. In contrast, The African Times emphasizes the missionaries' quiet and arduous work, attributing their patience and dedication to their God-fearing and Christian nature, and explicitly stating that they do not seek recognition or reward. The articles highlight the hardships faced by missionaries, such as illness and lack of funds, and their continued commitment despite these challenges, underscoring their religious motivations. Together, these sources illustrate that while the missionaries' perseverance and dedication are evident, their motivations were multifaceted, involving both religious convictions and other factors such as cultural superiority and colonial interests.

# The British East Africa Company played a significant role in the region's development, particularly in infrastructure and exploration.

The claim that the British East Africa Company played a significant role in the region's development, particularly in infrastructure and exploration, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some nuances. The General History of Africa textbook notes that the British East Africa Company emerged from plans to build roads to Lake Nyasa and Lake Victoria, initially proposed by William Mackinnon. Although these roads were not constructed, the company's formation during the partition period suggests a foundational role in infrastructure planning. However, the textbook does not provide specific details about the company's direct involvement in infrastructure projects or exploration activities, instead highlighting broader colonial efforts in building railways and roads primarily for exporting raw materials. In contrast, The African Times articles provide more direct support for the claim, detailing the Company's efforts in preventing hostilities, negotiating treaties with local chiefs, and establishing communication through roads and telegraphs. The articles credit the Company with cutting a 300-mile road into the interior, establishing stations, surveying for a railway line, and conducting expeditions to establish posts and explore regions like the Tana River and between Machakos and Lake Victoria. Additionally, the Company is noted for its role in abolishing slavery in Witu and emancipating slaves near Mombasa. Despite these contributions, the articles also highlight the financial burden on the Company and the lack of support from the British government, contrasting with the support European governments provided to similar enterprises elsewhere in Africa. This lack of governmental backing may have impacted the Company's ability to further its developmental goals, offering a more complex view of its role in the region's development.

# The slave trade had devastating effects on African societies, leading to depopulation and decline.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the slave trade had devastating effects on African societies, leading to depopulation and decline. The textbook details how raids and wars associated with the slave trade resulted in the depopulation of entire regions, as exemplified by the Ajawa raids and a British official's account of ruined towns and villages. This loss of productive members of society exacerbated rural dislocation and recurring famines, further intensifying the population drain. The slave trade disrupted social and political structures, with kidnapping, raiding, and wars destroying local industries and economies. Economic dislocation was further compounded by the export of many productive individuals and the introduction of diseases, contributing to underdevelopment and preventing the resurgence of rural economies, leading to impoverishment and instability in neighboring communities. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the desolation brought to Africa by the slave trade, with the Bishop of Winchester noting the fear and abandonment in once flourishing areas like the shores of Lake Nyanza. Sir Samuel Baker describes the depopulation of prosperous regions in Central Africa, with an estimated fifty thousand slaves taken annually, resulting in a significant population drain and moral degradation among the natives. Colonel Lavigerie corroborates these observations, stating that the province of Manyuema, once rich in ivory and population, was turned into a desert by slave-hunters. Collectively, these accounts illustrate the profound social, economic, and demographic impacts of the slave trade on African societies, aligning with the claim of depopulation and societal decline, with no information provided to refute this devastating narrative.

# The suppression of the slave trade required international cooperation and was not solely a British effort.

The suppression of the slave trade required international cooperation and was not solely a British effort, as evidenced by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the involvement of various countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, and France, in reciprocal suppression agreements, underscoring a level of international collaboration. Spain and Portugal, for instance, agreed to suppression treaties in exchange for indemnities, and France eventually signed a reciprocal search agreement with Britain. Mixed commissions, involving multiple nations, played a crucial role in adjudicating captured slave ships. The United States, despite initial resistance, committed to the right of search during the Civil War, further contributing to suppression efforts. However, the textbook also emphasizes Britain's leading role through its naval power and diplomatic efforts, suggesting that while international cooperation was necessary, Britain was a primary driver of the movement. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the significant influence of British settlements on the West Coast in suppressing the slave trade in their vicinity, with the trade disappearing from areas near British, Dutch, Danish, and Liberian territories, indicating a broader regional effort. The articles also stress the necessity of international cooperation, with Earl Granville discussing communications with France, America, Portugal, and Germany, and receiving assurances of cooperation. Additionally, the potential role of steam navigation along the eastern coast is mentioned as part of the broader strategy. Overall, both sources acknowledge the importance of international collaboration while recognizing Britain's significant influence in the suppression of the slave trade.

# The British intervention in the slave trade altered regional trade relationships and weakened economic ties.

The British intervention in the slave trade significantly altered regional trade relationships and weakened economic ties, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The abolition of the slave trade by Britain in 1807 initiated a shift from the slave trade to legitimate commerce in goods like palm oil and rubber, facilitated by British treaties and naval power. This transition eroded the sovereignty of local rulers and established new trade regulations, particularly in regions like the Bight of Bonny and the Gold Coast, where British economic activities and judicial systems favored their interests, thereby weakening traditional economic ties. The British anti-slavery campaign reduced the number of Africans taken to the Americas, affecting labor supply conditions and altering the economic landscape. Concurrently, The African Times highlights how British efforts led to the registration and freeing of 1,409 slaves, severing Indian merchants' connections with the Arab government and increasing British consular oversight. The cessation of support and money-lending for the slave trade by Khojah and Battiah merchants further weakened economic ties. The British naval strategy to suppress the slave trade disrupted trade routes and diminished the value of slaves, driving the trade out of the Persian Gulf and causing it to flourish under the French flag between Madagascar and Mozambique. These developments collectively illustrate how British intervention disrupted existing trade relationships and contributed to a reconfiguration of economic ties in Africa.

# The health conditions and environmental factors significantly influenced trade in West Africa.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that health conditions and environmental factors significantly influenced trade in West Africa. The textbook highlights the devastating impact of diseases such as smallpox and cholera, introduced by coastal traders, which reduced rural productivity and intensified malnourishment and disease, thereby disrupting communities and trade networks. It also notes the spread of venereal disease and diarrhea among migrant laborers, emphasizing the role of health in shaping labor and trade dynamics. Environmental changes, like forest clearance and hunting, further altered the disease environment, indirectly affecting trade by impacting population health and productivity. Complementing these insights, The African Times articles frequently mention the health of rivers and ports in relation to trade activity. For instance, in Benin, despite good river health, trade is dull, while in Bonny, improved health conditions coincide with the opening of trade. In Sierra Leone, unhealthy conditions and prevalent fever nearly suspend trade, illustrating a direct health-commerce link. The closure of trade at Abeokuta due to native wars underscores the influence of environmental and social factors. However, in Lagos, brisk trade occurs despite merely healthy conditions, suggesting other factors also play a role. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that aligns with the claim, highlighting a complex relationship where health and environmental conditions can both directly and indirectly affect trade activities, while also acknowledging that this relationship is not always straightforward.

# The resistance of local African authorities to British demands illustrates the complexities and challenges of colonial governance.

The complexities and challenges of colonial governance, particularly in the face of resistance from local African authorities to British demands, are well-documented in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the widespread resistance of African leaders, such as Prempeh I of Asante and Wobogo, the King of the Mossi, who explicitly rejected British and French offers of protection, underscoring their determination to maintain sovereignty. The Nandi in Kenya exemplify prolonged military resistance, illustrating the difficulties colonial powers faced in subduing local populations. Additionally, the text discusses the challenges colonial administrators encountered in managing relationships between traditional and new African elites, further complicating governance. Similarly, The African Times articles describe how Captain Glover's enforcement of an ordinance prohibiting the export of arms led to significant trade disruptions and strained relations with local authorities like the Egba, Ijebu, and Porto Novo. The Egbas' strategic closure of trade routes to counter British influence, coupled with the merchants' meetings in Liverpool and Manchester, highlights the economic challenges and the need for governmental intervention. Mr. T. E. Tomlinson's suggestion of annexation reflects the British desire to exert more control over resistant local authorities. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted challenges colonial powers faced due to the determined resistance of African societies, emphasizing the persistent opposition and complexities inherent in imposing colonial rule.

---

# The involvement of local African politics significantly impacted trade dynamics in the region.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that local African politics significantly impacted trade dynamics in the region. The textbook describes how political instability, such as the Nguni invasions and internal rivalries, led to the rise of enterprising leaders and the formation of new dominions, influencing trade routes and control. Local rulers, like the Bemba and Chewa chiefs, formed alliances with foreign traders, strengthening their political power and impacting trade, as seen with the Bemba kingdom's expansion and the Chewa chief's acquisition of firearms. Political changes, such as the abolition of the slave trade, prompted shifts in trade dynamics, with local rulers and merchants seeking new commodities to maintain their economic status. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight how local political conflicts, such as the domestic war at Porto Novo involving two sets of Princes and the Egbas, directly affected trade routes and economic activities, disrupting trade in Lagos. The blockade at Dahomey, maintained by seven of Her Majesty's ships, and disturbances in Ashanti and Gaboon further illustrate how political unrest and military actions disrupted trade. The blockade of the Whydah coast and the attack by the Dahomans near Grand Popo underscore the influence of local conflicts on trade stability. Both sources consistently support the claim by demonstrating the intricate relationship between political developments and trade dynamics in Africa, with no evidence provided to refute the claim.

# The strategic importance of certain locations for trade and naval operations during this period.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the strategic importance of certain locations for trade and naval operations during the period in question. The textbook highlights Zanzibar's pivotal role as a trade hub for ivory and slaves due to its strategic position opposite the Mrima coast, as well as the prominence of the port of Mogador in Morocco, which captured a significant share of trans-Saharan trade. Coastal towns like Lagos, Porto Novo, and Cotonou are noted for becoming crucial ports and political capitals due to their strategic locations. Additionally, European interest in North Africa, particularly the Maghrib, was driven by the need to control trade routes and suppress piracy, as seen in British and French naval operations. The Indian Ocean trade involving the Sultan of Zanzibar further underscores the strategic significance of East African coastal areas in the global trade network. Meanwhile, The African Times articles emphasize the economic importance of West African ports such as Fernando Po, Cameroons, Old Calabar, and Bonny, highlighting brisk trade activities and the presence of Her Majesty's ship Spiteful at Madeira, which points to strategic naval operations. The articles also mention disturbances at Goree and Accra, indicating the geopolitical significance of these locations. While the textbook focuses more on trade dynamics and strategic positioning, the articles provide a nuanced view through trade and local conflicts, with less emphasis on explicit military strategy. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted strategic importance of specific locations for trade and naval operations during this period.

# The economic activities in African regions during the 19th century were heavily influenced by European traders and their demands.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that economic activities in African regions during the 19th century were heavily influenced by European traders and their demands. The transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, such as palm oil, groundnuts, and ivory, was driven by European economic interests, as these commodities were in high demand in European markets. The European presence on the African coast facilitated the spread of trade more rapidly than missionary influence, with former slave traders often pioneering the new trade. The European demand for raw materials, such as oils for industrial use, further integrated African economies into the capitalist world economy. European commercial firms played a significant role in connecting Africa with Western markets, often exploiting African producers through unequal exchange. The expansion of European trade was also dependent on pre-existing African trade networks, which were adapted to meet European demands. However, the transformation of African economic structures was not solely due to European influence; internal dynamics and traditional trade systems played a crucial role, with the rise of a politically powerful merchant class and shifts in income distribution from ruling elites to ordinary people being significant internal changes. The African Times articles further illustrate this influence, describing instances where trade was affected by European interests and actions. In Bonny, trade was halted due to high prices asked by natives for oil, but some native traders eventually agreed to European prices, indicating European influence on pricing and trade dynamics. In Lagos, a blockade instituted by Governor Freeman, a European, controlled the flow of goods, particularly guns and gunpowder, which were in demand by the natives. The King of Whydah's offer to place the region in the hands of the Commodore and rebuild the English fort highlights the political and economic leverage Europeans held. Additionally, the prohibition of trade in Accra due to a government-imposed fine suggests European administrative control over trade practices. These examples collectively underscore the significant impact of European traders and their demands on the economic activities in African regions during the 19th century, while also acknowledging the complexity and multifaceted nature of these economic transformations.

# The introduction of new economic policies and infrastructure facilitated trade growth in Lagos.

The introduction of new economic policies and infrastructure significantly facilitated trade growth in Lagos, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the formal annexation of Lagos to the British Crown in 1861 as a pivotal event that, along with British naval actions, heightened European interest in the region, primarily driven by trade opportunities with the Yoruba and Aja interior. This period marked a transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, such as palm oil, underscoring the economic transformation facilitated by new policies. The establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines between Brazil and Lagos, replacing slave ships, and the dominance of the Elder Dempster Line in British West Africa by 1900, illustrate the infrastructural shifts that supported trade growth. Similarly, The African Times highlights the introduction of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which increased specie transactions and encouraged shipments by small traders through financial advances, contributing to trade growth by providing more accessible financial services. The shift from barter to silver currency and the gradual adoption of specie payments further modified trade methods, suggesting an evolution in economic policies. Additionally, the opening of roads by previously obstructive tribes improved infrastructure and trade routes. While The African Times does not explicitly mention specific government policies or infrastructure projects, both sources collectively illustrate how changes in financial systems, trade routes, and shipping infrastructure contributed to the growth of trade in Lagos.

# The road project highlights the economic challenges faced in completing infrastructure without sufficient funding.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the economic challenges faced in completing infrastructure projects without sufficient funding. The General History of Africa highlights historical instances where the Liberian government, constrained by limited financial resources, resorted to forced, unpaid indigenous labor to build roads. Similarly, in the Belgian Congo and AOF, infrastructure projects like railways were financed through significant borrowing, leading to increased debt burdens during the Great Depression. These projects were often prioritized for economic exploitation rather than general welfare, with infrastructure primarily serving to evacuate exports rather than facilitate inter-African travel or development. The economic depression further exacerbated financial constraints, resulting in the suspension of many capital projects and a reliance on forced labor to maintain existing infrastructure. In parallel, The African Times articles illustrate contemporary financial challenges, noting that the Aquapem road project relied on external financial support from friends of Africa, and the Aburi-Abokobi road faced funding shortfalls, prompting appeals for further subscriptions. The articles also describe efforts to train bullocks and buffaloes for cart drawing as a cost-effective solution in the absence of adequate resources. While the articles focus on immediate funding needs, they align with the broader historical context of financial difficulties and reliance on non-economic means to advance infrastructure development, as depicted in the textbook.

# The presence of religious figures like the Bishop of Cape Town and Bishop Tozer in the region highlights the role of missionary work in colonial Africa.

The examination of both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provides a nuanced perspective on the role of religious figures and missionary work in colonial Africa. The textbook offers a comprehensive overview of missionary work's significant impact on African societies, emphasizing the influence of missionary societies in political affairs, the spread of Christianity, and education. It highlights the establishment of mission stations and the creation of an African class of evangelists and professionals, noting the missionaries' role in paving the way for colonial rule. However, it does not specifically mention religious figures like the Bishop of Cape Town or Bishop Tozer, nor does it directly address their roles in the region. In contrast, The African Times articles mention the presence of these bishops but do not explicitly link them to missionary work. Instead, the articles focus on practical and economic activities, such as infrastructure development and the establishment of a cotton factory and plantation by a lay missionary, Mr. Schellenberg, who is not identified as a religious figure. This suggests that while religious figures were present, the articles emphasize economic contributions over direct missionary activities. The absence of explicit references to religious activities by the bishops in both sources highlights a notable difference from the claim, which suggests a more direct role of religious figures in missionary work.

# The region east of Bakundu was guarded by tribes that were protective of their territory against foreign intrusion.

The claim that the region east of Bakundu was guarded by tribes protective of their territory against foreign intrusion is supported by observations from The African Times, which detail Herr Schwarz's journey into the area. His account describes encountering a territory rigorously guarded by tribes, with his advance halted by a party of 500 armed individuals, indicating a strong defensive stance against outsiders. This directly supports the notion of territorial protection by the tribes in that region. However, the "General History of Africa" textbook does not specifically mention the region east of Bakundu or any tribes guarding it against foreign intrusion. Instead, it provides a broader context of African societies' varied responses to foreign penetration, ranging from resistance, as seen with the Azande under Yambio, to strategic alliances by groups like the Maasai and the Baganda. The text highlights how some societies were strengthened by trade, while others faced ecological and social disruptions. The absence of specific information about the region east of Bakundu in the textbook suggests that the claim may not be directly supported or refuted by its content, but it offers valuable context for understanding the broader dynamics of foreign intrusion during the colonial period.

# The emigration of African Americans to Liberia was seen as a potential catalyst for the growth and development of the region.

The emigration of African Americans to Liberia was widely perceived as a potential catalyst for the growth and development of the region, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the efforts of figures like Bishop Turner, who advocated for African American emigration to Liberia to establish independent nations and civilizations, free from U.S. oppression. Turner's initiatives led to the emigration of over 300 Afro-Americans in 1896, with the belief that American 'black capitalists' could profit through trade with Liberia. The establishment of the African Development Society in 1899 further underscored the belief in economic growth through emigration, while the involvement of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association in plans to bring capital and black immigrants to Liberia reinforced this perception. However, challenges such as poor living conditions reported by some returnees were noted, which tempered the likelihood of large-scale emigration. Similarly, The African Times articles expressed optimism that the movement of emancipated slaves to Liberia could significantly increase the country's civilized population, drawing parallels to the beneficial Irish emigration to the United States. The Liberian Government's offer of land to suitable African American emigrants and positive reports from those already settled in Liberia were seen as encouraging further migration, suggesting a growing momentum for regional development. Together, these sources illustrate both the aspirations and challenges associated with African American emigration to Liberia as a means of fostering growth and development in the region.

# The Colonization Society played a crucial role in facilitating the migration of freed slaves to Liberia, but its efforts were limited by financial constraints.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the American Colonization Society (ACS) played a crucial role in facilitating the migration of freed slaves to Liberia, but its efforts were limited by financial constraints. The textbook details how the ACS was instrumental in founding Liberia in 1822 and assisted in settling 'free' Afro-Americans and recaptured Africans, with the support of the United States government, helping to settle over 18,000 New World Africans in Liberia by 1906. However, it also highlights the financial constraints faced by the ACS, noting its reliance on both Federal and State government support and the limited number of settlers who returned to Africa by 1860. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the society's role in organizing and funding the transportation of emigrants, mentioning the sending of ships and providing six months of support upon arrival. Yet, they also underscore financial limitations, reporting that potential emigrants were reduced from 4,000 to 5,000 to just 1,500 due to insufficient funds, and that several families of "Arkansas refugees" could not be sent for lack of funds. These observations collectively illustrate the significant yet financially constrained role of the ACS in the migration of freed slaves to Liberia, aligning with the claim.

# The transition from past barbarism to future civilized industrial development in Africa is hindered by the absence of capital and security.

The transition from past to future development in Africa is a complex process influenced by various factors, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a nuanced perspective, acknowledging the scarcity of foreign capital investment during the colonial period, which aligns with the claim that the absence of capital hinders development. However, it also emphasizes that coercion, rather than capital, was the primary means of mobilizing labor and surplus, suggesting that the lack of capital was not the sole barrier. The deliberate neglect of industrialization by colonial powers and the impact of colonial monetary policies further impeded development, supporting the claim. Despite these challenges, the textbook notes some progress through export agriculture and income redistribution, while also highlighting resistance and struggle as indicators of the significant role of security in hindering development. The African Times articles reinforce the claim by emphasizing the critical need for capital and security, noting that development could progress more rapidly if these were available. The articles highlight the reluctance to advance capital without security and discuss challenges in capital management, such as employing expensive European supervision or untrusted colored agency. Liberia's struggle with capital and the need for a settled government to attract investment further illustrate these obstacles. Although the articles do not use the term "barbarism," they imply a transition from underdevelopment to industrialization. Together, these sources underscore the intertwined issues of capital and security as significant barriers to Africa's development.

# The Americo-Liberian settlement of Arthington demonstrates the potential for successful community development in West Africa through hard work and agricultural cultivation.

The claim that the Americo-Liberian settlement of Arthington demonstrates the potential for successful community development in West Africa through hard work and agricultural cultivation is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with varying levels of specificity. The General History of Africa does not specifically mention Arthington but provides a broader context of Americo-Liberian settlements and the emigration of Afro-Americans to Liberia. It highlights efforts to promote agriculture and community development, such as Bishop Turner's advocacy for emigration and the establishment of Afro-American communities, as well as the promotion of agriculture and skills training by missionaries. These efforts suggest a potential for successful community development through hard work and agricultural cultivation, aligning with the general idea of community development in West Africa. In contrast, The African Times provides specific details about Arthington, describing it as the most flourishing and promising of all Liberian communities, founded about ten years prior by settlers from North and South Carolina. The settlers transformed an unbroken forest into a thriving community, cultivating 600 acres of land, planting 150,000 young coffee trees, and harvesting 30,000 lbs. of coffee valued at approximately $6000. This success, along with the construction of good houses and a neat church through collective effort, underscores the potential for successful community development through diligent labor and agricultural initiatives. Together, these observations illustrate the broader potential for community development in West Africa, with Arthington serving as a specific example of success.

# The growth and development of Liberia were seen as a testament to the potential of African self-governance and a challenge to the negative stereotypes held by some European anthropologists.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of Liberia's growth and development as a testament to African self-governance and a challenge to negative stereotypes held by some European anthropologists. The General History of Africa highlights Liberia's resilience and strategic governance, evidenced by its survival against European encroachments and diplomatic maneuvers to maintain sovereignty, which could be seen as challenging negative stereotypes. As the first African republic, Liberia's efforts to maintain independence despite European imperialism underscore its potential for self-governance. However, the textbook also points out significant internal challenges, such as the dominance of the Americo-Liberian elite, limited political inclusion of indigenous Liberians, and economic struggles leading to foreign control over financial administration, complicating the narrative of successful self-governance. In contrast, The African Times emphasizes Liberia's status as the first independent civilized African state on the West Coast, with institutions modeled after the United States and exclusively African governance, countering contempt from some European anthropologists. The articles highlight Liberia's progress despite limited resources, comparing it favorably to English colonies supported by British capital, and note the interest of emancipated African Americans in emigrating to Liberia, suggesting recognition of African self-governance potential. However, they also acknowledge challenges, such as slow progress in civilizing the native population and unsuitable education. Together, these sources present a nuanced picture of Liberia's development, recognizing both its achievements in challenging racial inferiority stereotypes and its ongoing challenges.

# The influence of foreign powers, such as Britain, was a significant concern in Liberian politics, with rumors of foreign interference being used to manipulate voter perceptions.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both highlight the significant concern over foreign influence in Liberian politics, though they approach the topic from slightly different angles. The textbook details how Liberia's financial indebtedness and economic conditions led to increased foreign control and intervention by entities like the International Receivership and the Bank of British West Africa, with support from the United States government. It also describes the political rivalry between the True Whig and People's parties, where opposition leader Faulkner sought international support to discredit the ruling administration, indicating the use of foreign influence as a political tool. Furthermore, it mentions Britain's condemnation of Liberia's labor practices and demands for European control, alongside persistent interference by Britain, France, and Germany, which led to political divisions within Liberia, such as the formation of pro-British and pro-American factions. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention the use of rumors to manipulate voter perceptions. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the role of rumors during elections, such as allegations that British gold was used by the Republican party to purchase votes, influencing the perceptions of less informed voters. The articles also discuss the involvement of German merchants and the potential for a German protectorate, underscoring concerns about foreign influence. While the articles emphasize perceptions and rumors rather than concrete actions by foreign powers, both sources collectively underscore the significant impact of foreign influence on Liberian politics, aligning with the claim's emphasis on the manipulation of voter perceptions through the specter of foreign interference.

# The naming of Monrovia and Liberia reflects the influence of American political figures and the settlers' aspirations for liberty.

The naming of Monrovia and Liberia reflects the influence of American political figures and the settlers' aspirations for liberty, as supported by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa details that Monrovia, established in 1822, was named after James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States, highlighting the impact of American political figures. Similarly, The African Times notes that Monrovia was named in 1824 in honor of the then U.S. President, further emphasizing this influence. Both sources agree that the name "Liberia," derived from the Latin word for "liberty," signifies the settlers' aspirations for freedom and a new beginning free from oppression. The African Times elaborates that the name was chosen to reflect the social condition and aspirations of the colonists, who sought genuine freedom in Africa, contrasting with the nominal freedom they experienced in America. Neither source provides information that refutes the claim, reinforcing the association between the naming of Monrovia and Liberia and the influence of American political figures alongside the settlers' pursuit of liberty.

# The refusal of English merchants to recognize Liberian customs duties highlighted the challenges faced by emerging African states in asserting economic independence.

The challenges faced by emerging African states like Liberia in asserting economic independence are highlighted through observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa outlines Liberia's economic struggles, including near-bankruptcy, heavy indebtedness to foreign creditors, and the influence of European powers on its financial administration, which led to increased foreign control and intervention. The textbook also notes the imposition of trade restrictions and levies by the Liberian government, which alienated foreign merchants and indigenous African chiefs, leading to resistance and appeals for European intervention. However, it does not specifically mention the refusal of English merchants to recognize Liberian customs duties. In contrast, The African Times provides direct evidence supporting the claim, detailing how English merchants refused to recognize the Liberian-imposed ad valorem customs duty of 6 percent on foreign imports, treating Liberia as a "savage territory" and undermining its economic sovereignty. The articles further highlight Liberia's struggle for international recognition, noting the English government's refusal to acknowledge the Liberian Executive and the lukewarm support from the United States due to racial prejudices. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted economic and diplomatic challenges Liberia faced in asserting its independence and rights as a sovereign state.

# The history of Africa has been significantly shaped by natural disasters, which have impacted both the population and the economy.

The "General History of Africa" textbook provides several details supporting the claim that natural disasters have significantly shaped Africa's history, impacting both the population and the economy. It mentions famines and epidemics, such as smallpox and cholera, which devastated Central Africa due to the population's lack of immunity. These health crises, exacerbated by malnutrition and psychological stress, led to high mortality rates, reduced rural productivity, and social upheavals, including witchcraft accusations and increased slave trade. Additionally, the text highlights recurring famines in regions like the Zambezi and Shire valleys, intensified by unstable conditions and raids, further draining the population. These natural and health-related disasters contributed to economic and demographic instability in Africa, aligning with the claim that natural disasters have played a significant role in shaping the continent's history. However, the text also emphasizes the impact of external factors, such as colonialism and the slave trade, suggesting that while natural disasters were influential, they were part of a broader set of challenges that shaped Africa's historical trajectory. In contrast, the African Times news articles do not contain any information directly related to the claim, as they focus on natural disasters in other parts of the world, specifically in South America and Europe. The absence of any mention of African natural disasters in these articles is notable, suggesting that the African Times did not cover African natural disasters in these instances, or that such events were not deemed significant enough to be included in the selected articles. This lack of coverage could interest historians examining the representation and perceived importance of African events in historical media.

# The aftermath of natural disasters in Africa often includes secondary crises, such as disease outbreaks and social unrest, which exacerbate the initial devastation.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the aftermath of natural disasters often includes secondary crises, such as disease outbreaks and social unrest, which exacerbate the initial devastation. The General History of Africa provides detailed accounts of how famines and psychological stress left African populations vulnerable to infectious diseases like smallpox and cholera, carried by coastal traders. These diseases led to epidemics that further reduced rural productivity and intensified malnourishment and disease, resulting in social upheavals, including increased witchcraft accusations and a rise in the slave trade as societies sought to compensate for demographic losses. Additionally, forced labor and poor living conditions during the colonial period contributed to malnutrition, severe famine, and epidemics, illustrating a cycle of secondary crises exacerbating initial devastation. However, the text does not explicitly link these crises to natural disasters, focusing more on the consequences of epidemics and colonial exploitation. In contrast, The African Times articles, while not specific to Africa, provide insights into the aftermath of earthquakes in South America and Italy, where secondary crises such as disease outbreaks and social unrest were evident. In South America, victims succumbed to fever and lock-jaw, and looting and violence occurred amidst the chaos, aligning with the claim. The Italian earthquake account emphasizes immediate destruction and loss of life, with less focus on secondary crises, though the prolonged recovery period is implied. While these articles illustrate similar patterns of secondary crises following natural disasters, they do not provide direct evidence related to Africa, highlighting a gap in the information. Together, these sources underscore the complex aftermath of natural disasters, marked by secondary crises that compound the initial devastation, albeit with varying regional contexts and emphases.

# The involvement of foreign residents and expatriates in African disaster relief efforts has been notable, sometimes highlighting disparities in resources and influence between locals and foreigners.

The examination of both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveals a notable absence of direct information regarding the involvement of foreign residents and expatriates in African disaster relief efforts, as suggested by the claim. The "General History of Africa" primarily addresses historical interactions, colonial impacts, and cultural exchanges between Africans and foreign settlers, such as Europeans and missionaries, highlighting disparities in resources and influence during colonial rule. However, it does not specifically discuss disaster relief efforts or the role of expatriates in such contexts. Similarly, The African Times articles focus on disasters in Europe, specifically the floods in Toulouse and the earthquake in Casamicciola, where English and American residents in Paris are noted for their financial contributions to relief efforts. This highlights foreign involvement in disaster relief, but in a European context, not an African one. The absence of coverage on African disaster relief efforts in both sources underscores a gap in addressing the claim's focus on the role of foreign residents and expatriates in Africa, suggesting a disparity in resources and influence that remains unexplored in these texts.

# The involvement of both Europeans and native Africans in organizing events or efforts indicates a level of collaboration and shared interests between colonizers and the colonized.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a multifaceted view of the interactions between Europeans and native Africans during the colonial period, offering both support and complexity to the claim of collaboration and shared interests. The "General History of Africa" highlights instances where African leaders and societies, such as the Inhambane Tonga, the Sena, and Tofa of Porto Novo, allied with European colonizers not out of shared interests but as strategic moves to protect or advance their own sovereignty against rival African groups. This suggests that these alliances were more about strategic necessity than genuine collaboration, with African levies in European armies and involvement in missionary and trade activities driven by pragmatic considerations. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence supporting the claim of collaboration, detailing events like the meeting convened by Governor Griffith, which included both European officials and native Africans to discuss Lagos's representation at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1886. The formation of a sub-committee comprising both groups and the involvement of both European and native officials in the Lagos Races under Deputy Governor Evans's patronage illustrate cooperation and shared interests in organizing cultural and economic events. However, the articles do not delve into the dynamics or power relations within these collaborations, leaving room for further exploration of the nuances in such interactions. Together, these sources present a complex picture of African-European interactions, characterized by both strategic alliances and instances of cooperation, challenging a straightforward narrative of collaboration and shared interests.

# The British colonial government did not provide adequate protection or governance to the people of Gondomah after the land was ceded to them.

The examination of the claim that the British colonial government did not provide adequate protection or governance to the people of Gondomah after the land was ceded to them reveals differing insights from two sources. The "General History of Africa" textbook does not mention Gondomah or provide specific information about British governance in this region, focusing instead on broader themes of British colonial rule in Africa, such as land alienation, conflicts with indigenous populations, and socio-political dynamics in areas like South Africa, Somaliland, Northern Rhodesia, and West Africa. This absence of information about Gondomah suggests that the textbook does not address or support the claim regarding British actions in this specific area. In contrast, The African Times news articles offer several details supporting the claim. They note that Bundukah, the Chief of Gondomah, governed without any British local authority present, indicating a lack of direct British governance. Testimonies from individuals like Mr. Thomas Ashford Peters and Edward Green Conolly further suggest that British administrative presence and intervention were minimal, as disputes required external assistance from figures like Capt. Walshe. Additionally, the articles mention that the chief remained in authority after the land was ceded to the Queen of England, potentially contributing to conflicts with neighboring tribes. While these articles support the claim of inadequate British governance, they do not explicitly state the British government's intentions or policies in Gondomah, leaving room for further historical inquiry into colonial administration practices.

# The failure of the colonial government to effectively mediate peace reflects the challenges of colonial administration in understanding and integrating local customs and political structures.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the challenges faced by colonial administrations in understanding and integrating local customs and political structures, which ultimately hindered their ability to mediate peace effectively. The textbook highlights how colonial conquest weakened indigenous systems of government by imposing foreign administrative structures that often disregarded or distorted traditional African institutions. Colonial powers, such as the French and British, either abolished traditional monarchies or manipulated them to serve their interests, leading to a loss of prestige and authority among traditional rulers and resulting in revolts and rebellions. This manipulation, coupled with the cultural and political dissonance between colonial regimes and local elites, both traditional and educated, further complicated the colonial administration's efforts to integrate local customs. The approach of indirect rule, intended to preserve some local structures, often resulted in a superficial and distorted incorporation of indigenous institutions, leading to discontent and resistance. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the colonial government's failure to prevent conflict among tribes, criticizing the Governor's peace efforts as lacking sufficient time and consideration of native views and customs. The articles also illustrate the disconnect between colonial authorities and local communities, as seen in a legal case involving Whobay, where communication barriers and the reluctance of witnesses to attend court exemplify the challenges in integrating local customs into governance. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the colonial government's difficulties in managing local affairs, supporting the claim that their failure to mediate peace reflects broader challenges in understanding and integrating local customs and political structures.

# The use of coercion to compel men to serve in war efforts reflects the exploitative practices of colonial administrations.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that coercion was used to compel men to serve in war efforts, reflecting the exploitative practices of colonial administrations. The textbook details various instances of forced recruitment and conscription across different African regions during colonial rule, such as the British imposing compulsory military service in British East Africa and the Uganda Protectorate, the French conscripting over 483,000 colonial soldiers from Africa during World War I, and the Belgians impressing a significant number of porters in the Congo. These practices highlight the exploitative nature of colonial administrations, prioritizing military and economic needs over the well-being and autonomy of local populations. The broader context of coercion in colonial economies, including forced labor and tax impositions to drive Africans into wage labor, further underscores these exploitative dynamics. Similarly, The African Times articles detail orders compelling able-bodied men to participate in war efforts, with penalties such as arrest, forced labor without pay, and flogging for non-compliance, reflecting the coercive mobilization of local populations. The articles also criticize some chiefs for collaborating with colonial officials, exploiting their people, and highlight the involvement of local tribes and the Sierra Leone frontier police in military operations, suggesting coercive recruitment practices. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the coercive and exploitative practices in colonial military efforts, aligning with the claim.

# The presence of armed groups like the Houssa men on the River Volta indicates a complex power dynamic involving local leaders and colonial authorities.

The claim that the presence of armed groups like the Houssa men on the River Volta indicates a complex power dynamic involving local leaders and colonial authorities is supported by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit in different ways. The textbook provides a broader context of complex power dynamics in the region, highlighting interactions between local leaders, colonial powers, and armed groups. It discusses the role of local chiefs in colonial administration, the use of indirect rule, and the involvement of local leaders in resistance movements, as well as the influence of armed groups and military techniques on local societies. However, it does not specifically mention the Houssa men on the River Volta. In contrast, The African Times explicitly mentions the Houssa men, led by Otuman Katto, and describes their authorization by both local leaders, such as King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey, and colonial authorities, referred to as "his Excellency the Governor." This suggests a collaboration or tacit approval from both local and colonial powers, indicating a complex interplay of authority. The articles also highlight the involvement of local leaders in sanctioning violent actions against groups like the Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos, with the supposed approval of colonial officials. This dynamic is further complicated by the fact that some territories, like King Dagado's, are not within the colonial Protectorate, yet the actions of the Houssa men affect trade and security in the region. Together, these observations illustrate the intertwined roles of local and colonial authorities in governance and control, as well as the impact on trade and local populations, aligning with the claim of a complex power dynamic.

# The British faced significant resistance from local forces in Sierra Leone, indicating the challenges of colonial military campaigns in Africa.

The claim that the British faced significant resistance from local forces in Sierra Leone, highlighting the challenges of colonial military campaigns in Africa, is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook provides a broader context of African resistance to European colonialism, mentioning regions like West Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria, but it does not offer specific details about military resistance in Sierra Leone. It notes the British annexation of the Vai chiefdoms in 1882 and the Crown's takeover of Sierra Leone in 1808, focusing more on administrative actions and development rather than military conflict. In contrast, The African Times articles detail a failed British-led police attack on Tambi, resulting in casualties and injuries among British forces, and describe resistance led by Carimoo, a local robber chief. This resistance, which included raids against tribes allied with the British, necessitated reliance on local tribes and the Sierra Leone frontier police, and even consideration of reinforcements from West Indian troops, underscoring the significant challenges faced by the British. These accounts from The African Times align with the claim by illustrating the formidable opposition encountered by British forces, while the textbook's broader focus suggests a difference in emphasis or detail regarding specific military resistance in Sierra Leone.

# The involvement of European missionaries and traders in African slavery suggests a complicated relationship between colonial interests and local practices.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the complex and multifaceted relationship between European missionaries, traders, and African slavery, highlighting the intricate dynamics between colonial interests and local practices. The textbook details how missionary societies often acted as precursors to colonial rule, with many Europeans involved in missionary activities before 1884, suggesting a link between religious missions and colonial interests. Mission stations, frequently established near slave caravans, evolved into theocratic states that weakened local societies, indirectly facilitating colonial rule. European traders and missionaries were also involved in the abolitionist movement, aiming to halt the slave trade at its source, indicating their dual role in both perpetuating and opposing slavery. Furthermore, European traders sought to bypass coastal middlemen to access interior markets directly, complicating their relationship with local practices. The involvement of European powers in treaties and local politics, often using force, underscores the entanglement of colonial interests with local dynamics. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles highlight the direct involvement of European traders like Mr. Henry Robbin in the slave trade, as evidenced by his purchase and attempted sale of Daniel Dopemu. The articles also mention Reverend Mr. Townsend, a European missionary, who was informed about Dopemu's situation, indicating a level of awareness or indirect involvement in the slave trade. Additionally, the letter of "Owuyeh" discusses the possession of slaves by ministers likely associated with the Church Missionary Society, further supporting the claim of European involvement in slavery. However, the articles also note efforts by some European entities, such as the Gold Coast Government, to address illegal slave-holding, reflecting a duality where some Europeans were complicit in slavery while others sought to abolish it. This duality illustrates the multifaceted and often contradictory roles of European missionaries and traders in the context of African slavery and colonialism, aligning with the claim of a complicated relationship between colonial interests and local practices.

# The British administration on the Gold Coast was perceived as unsatisfactory and poorly managed by local leaders.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that the British administration on the Gold Coast was perceived as unsatisfactory and poorly managed by local leaders. The textbook highlights widespread dissatisfaction among both traditional and new African elites, who viewed the colonial regimes as ambitious upstarts and were discontent with the administration. This dissatisfaction is further evidenced by the destoolment of traditional rulers by commoners, indicating a lack of satisfaction with leadership under colonial rule. The inadequacy and uneven distribution of educational facilities, along with the imposition of British educational models, underscore a disconnect between colonial policies and local needs. Economic grievances are also noted, with cocoa farmers staging hold-ups against expatriate firms and the colonial government, illustrating dissatisfaction with economic management. Similarly, The African Times articles reinforce this perception through a petition from the King, Chiefs, Headmen, and other residents, explicitly addressing the "present unsatisfactory state of affairs" and "mal-administration" on the coast. The petition also highlights the "undignified ill-treatment" of the King of Cape Coast by Colonel Conran, suggesting a lack of respect and proper management by British officials. While the articles include a letter from C. J. Blanc, Assistant Commissary-General, which focuses on his personal annoyance with being praised and does not address the administrative issues, the petition strongly supports the claim of poor administration and dissatisfaction among local leaders. Together, these sources paint a detailed picture of the perceived inadequacies of British governance on the Gold Coast.

# The Legislative Council at Cape Coast was heavily influenced by commercial interests, leading to potential abuses of power.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide direct information about the Legislative Council at Cape Coast being heavily influenced by commercial interests, leading to potential abuses of power. However, it does mention the influence of commercial interests in other contexts, such as the Cape Colony's 1853 constitution, which protected the interests of rich English merchants, and discusses the role of merchants and commercial activities in various regions, including the Gold Coast. These details suggest that commercial interests were influential in colonial governance and economic activities, though there is no specific mention of the Legislative Council at Cape Coast being affected in this way, highlighting a gap in the textbook's coverage. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide several details supporting the claim that the Legislative Council at Cape Coast was heavily influenced by commercial interests, leading to potential abuses of power. The articles describe the Council as being composed of four commercial agents from a single London firm, indicating significant commercial influence. One agent reportedly asserted his power over the head of the government, potentially controlling all appointments, aligning with the claim of commercial interests leading to abuses of power. Furthermore, the articles highlight the appointment of a young sub-agent from the same firm as the acting Civil Commandant for the Eastern Districts, facilitated by a Council member, and associate this with Mr. James Bannerman, known for abuses in justice administration. Concerns over disaffection in the Eastern Districts and potential complications and injustices further reinforce the claim of negative consequences stemming from the Council's composition. Overall, while the textbook lacks specific details on the Legislative Council at Cape Coast, The African Times articles provide a compelling account of commercial influence and potential abuses of power.

# The British administration on the Gold Coast faced significant challenges in maintaining control and influence due to local resistance and internal conflicts.

The British administration on the Gold Coast faced significant challenges in maintaining control and influence due to local resistance and internal conflicts, as detailed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the long-standing confrontation between the Asante and the British, noting military engagements and the Asante's initial successes against British forces. Despite the decisive defeat of the Asante in 1874, resistance persisted, exemplified by the 1900 Asante uprising led by Nana Yaa Asantewaa, which was sparked by British demands offensive to Asante cultural values, such as the request for the Golden Stool. Additionally, internal conflicts among African elites and the colonial administration's struggles to manage relationships between traditional and new elites further complicated British efforts to exert control. The African Times articles complement this by describing the defiance of local leaders like Cudjoe, Chief of British Accra, and Iyekee, Acting Chief of Christiansborg, who resisted British orders, leading to their suspension and outlaw status. The articles also recount the Awconahs blocking roads, attacking cotton-bearers, and taking slaves, illustrating the challenges in maintaining control. The mention of an "empty exchequer" and diminishing British influence in the interior, along with the deaths of key figures such as Captain Crozier and Lieutenant Sayce and reports of human sacrifices, underscore the volatile and unstable environment. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of the significant challenges the British faced in maintaining control and influence on the Gold Coast.

# The British administration on the Gold Coast was criticized for providing departing officials with undeservedly flattering testimonials, regardless of their actual performance or reputation.

The claim that the British administration on the Gold Coast was criticized for providing departing officials with undeservedly flattering testimonials is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times explicitly criticizes a "pernicious practice on the West Coast of Africa" where departing officials received "mendacious flattering testimonials" regardless of their actual performance or reputation. The article specifically mentions Mr. Ussher, a British official, who obtained such a testimonial despite his administration being denounced for having "intensely polluted" the settlement. These testimonials were reportedly sought to secure future benefits, such as increased salary or pension, highlighting a disconnect between official commendations and governance outcomes. In contrast, the General History of Africa does not contain specific information related to this claim. It focuses on broader aspects of colonial administration, such as the failure of assimilationist policies, the dynamics between traditional and new African elites, economic relations, and the impact of colonial rule on education and political structures, without mentioning practices related to the issuance of testimonials or evaluations of British officials' performances in the Gold Coast. This absence of information in the textbook suggests that it does not address this particular aspect of British colonial administration, highlighting an interesting difference between the two sources.

# The British colonial administration on the Gold Coast tolerated abuses of power that would not have been accepted elsewhere.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a compelling case that the British colonial administration on the Gold Coast tolerated abuses of power that might not have been accepted elsewhere. The General History of Africa highlights the destoolment of traditional rulers by commoners due to charges such as abuse of power, improper sale of land, and extortionate fines, with at least thirty-three divisional chiefs in Akyem Abuakwa deposed between 1910 and 1944. This suggests a level of tolerance or inability by the colonial administration to effectively address these abuses. Additionally, the influence of unofficial representatives of imperialism, such as commercial firms and banks, operating with little government interference, indicates a prioritization of economic interests over local welfare. The African Times articles further support this claim by detailing the actions of Captain A. H. Hall, a Stipendiary Magistrate, who cast "poor helpless natives" into dungeons with iron chains for minor infractions and entered gentlemen's houses without proper authority. These actions are portrayed as extreme and unjust, suggesting that such behavior would not have been tolerated in other British territories. The articles also criticize the broader colonial administration for its complicity and lack of accountability, as evidenced by calls for a superior Court of Inquiry to investigate these abuses. The mention of Lieutenant Bolton's time and the floggings of untried prisoners underscores the systemic nature of these abuses. Together, these sources highlight both specific instances of abuse and a broader culture of impunity, aligning with the claim that the British colonial administration on the Gold Coast tolerated abuses that would not have been accepted elsewhere.

# The British administration on the Gold Coast was characterized by indecision and inefficiency, leading to a system that was ultimately ineffective and corrupt.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the British administration on the Gold Coast, highlighting elements of indecision and inefficiency that contributed to a system perceived as ineffective and corrupt. The General History of Africa acknowledges instances of British indecision and inefficiency, such as the failure of the assimilationist policy and the frustration of educated Africans' expectations, leading to administrative personnel shortages. It also points to the British administration's struggles in managing relationships between traditional and new African elites and the uneven distribution of educational facilities. However, the textbook also notes decisive British actions, such as military campaigns against the Asante and the establishment of indirect rule, which demonstrate some effectiveness in maintaining control. Additionally, the British economic policies, while exploitative, successfully integrated the Gold Coast into the colonial economy, suggesting a level of efficiency. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly support the claim of a flawed system, describing it as "makeshift" and "rotten and effete," with a lack of coherent governance strategy. The articles highlight "vacillation and uncertainty" and provide examples of conflicting actions by different administrators, such as Colonel Conran's and Mr. Usher's contradictory proclamations, which created confusion and inefficiency. Chiefs' complaints about contradictory instructions from governors further emphasize the administration's inefficiency. Together, these sources present a nuanced picture of the British administration on the Gold Coast, marked by both inefficiencies and some effective strategies, yet largely aligning with the claim of an ultimately flawed governance system.

---

# The British administration on the Gold Coast was hindered by the ambiguous status of the territory as a protectorate rather than a full colony.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the challenges faced by the British administration on the Gold Coast due to its ambiguous status as a protectorate rather than a full colony. The General History of Africa notes that while the Gold Coast was granted its own governor in 1858, indicating a move towards more direct British control, it remained a protectorate apart from the forts. This status may have influenced administrative decisions and governance, as evidenced by the British government's decision to resume direct control of coastal settlements in 1843, suggesting that the protectorate status was seen as insufficient for British interests. However, the text stops short of explicitly stating that this status hindered administration, leaving room for interpretation. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim that the ambiguous protectorate status hindered British administration. They highlight the confusion among the natives, who believed the territory belonged to the Queen, and the technical and jurisdictional limitations faced by the British, who were cautious not to exceed their powers. The articles also discuss challenges such as domestic slavery and the lack of a circulating medium, which complicated the transition to a wage-based economy. Furthermore, conflicting actions and statements by British officials, like Mr. Cardwell's reluctance to claim territory beyond the forts and the cession of territories to the Dutch, led to unrest among the local population. These inconsistencies in policy and administration underscore the difficulties arising from the protectorate status, aligning with the claim that this ambiguity hindered effective governance and progress on the Gold Coast.

# The British government's lack of understanding of the social and moral dynamics of the Gold Coast contributed to ineffective governance.

The British government's lack of understanding of the social and moral dynamics of the Gold Coast significantly contributed to ineffective governance, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the British imposition of their governmental system, perceived as an encroachment by the local population, and the absence of a universal colonial theory accommodating the diverse cultures of the colonized peoples. This approach alienated both traditional and new African elites, frustrated the expectations of westernized Africans, and cultivated conflicts between different African leaderships. The British also failed to support the thriving local cocoa industry, illustrating their ineffective governance. Additionally, their instigation of internal conflicts within the Asante empire and the imposition of British law through the Bond of 1844, which ignored local legal traditions, further exemplify their limited understanding. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles highlight the inconsistent actions of British administrators, such as Colonel Conran's limited territorial proclamation contradicted by Mr. Usher's inland expedition, and the conflicting approaches of Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pine regarding local kingship. Chiefs expressed difficulty understanding government intentions due to frequent policy changes, where loyalty could swiftly turn to treason. These examples collectively underscore the British government's ignorance of the Gold Coast's social and moral context, leading to ineffective governance.

# The British administration on the Gold Coast was less efficient and more expensive than the previous merchant-led governance.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the claim that the British administration on the Gold Coast was less efficient and more expensive than the previous merchant-led governance. The General History of Africa highlights the autonomy and business acumen of Maclean, a key figure in the merchant-led governance, who often disregarded official instructions from London, suggesting a level of efficiency and adaptability. In contrast, the British administration, which resumed direct control in 1843, imposed legal conventions and recognized British law, indicating a more structured and bureaucratic approach. The colonial administration's reliance on force, such as during the cocoa hold-up in 1930, and the imposition of fines and imprisonment of chiefs, suggest a more resource-intensive and potentially less efficient method of governance. Additionally, the focus on promoting British interests often came at the expense of local development, implying inefficiencies in addressing local needs. The African Times further supports this claim by highlighting Mr. Andrew Swanzy's remarks on the higher costs and lower effectiveness of Imperial control compared to the merchant committee's administration. The introduction of a Bankruptcy Act under British rule is criticized for causing commercial ruin, and the colony is described as burdened with an expensive and unruly constabulary force, unlike the more efficient and cost-effective governance under Mr. George Maclean, who managed with a smaller force and budget. The articles also point out the unnecessary expense of a large number of officials in the colony, reinforcing the claim of inefficiency and higher costs under British administration. Together, these sources provide historical context and specific examples that align with the claim, though the textbook does not explicitly compare the costs of the two governance systems, leaving the claim partially supported but not conclusively proven.

# The British colonial system on the Gold Coast was criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, necessitating a formal Court of Inquiry to investigate abuses.

The British colonial system on the Gold Coast faced significant criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details various forms of resistance and grievances against the colonial administration, such as the destoolment of traditional rulers due to abuses of power and extortionate fines, resistance to the poll tax due to misallocation of funds, and dissatisfaction with the colonial economic system, exemplified by the cocoa hold-ups against expatriate firms' monopoly control. These instances reflect a broader discontent with the colonial administration's practices, suggesting a lack of transparency and accountability. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention a formal Court of Inquiry being established to investigate these abuses, focusing instead on local resistance and protest. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim by highlighting systemic abuses of power, such as a judge claiming to be above the law and administrators described as "pliant and ready tools." The articles emphasize the need for a superior Court of Inquiry under the Governor-General to address issues like the floggings of untried prisoners and the concentration of multiple official roles in one person, arguing that only an open Court of Inquiry can ensure transparency and accountability. Together, these sources underscore the widespread criticism of the colonial system and the perceived necessity for formal investigation to address the abuses.

# The British administration on the Gold Coast was capable of committing severe acts that were considered outrageous even by contemporary standards.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the claim that the British administration on the Gold Coast was capable of committing severe acts considered outrageous even by contemporary standards. The General History of Africa details the Asante uprising of 1900, which was provoked by the British governor's demand for the sacred Golden Stool, an act deeply offensive to the Asante people. The British response involved the arrest and deportation of key Asante leaders, including Nana Yaa Asantewaa, to the Seychelles. The textbook also highlights the imposition of high taxes and forced labor, drawing parallels to British methods of consolidating power, and describes economic policies that exploited the cocoa industry to benefit British interests at the expense of the local population. These actions, along with the suppression of resistance movements and manipulation of traditional leadership structures, underscore the oppressive nature of British colonial rule on the Gold Coast. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a direct assertion of a significant outrage committed under British rule, using the phrase "a greater outrage" to emphasize the severity of the act. However, the articles lack specific details about the nature of the outrage or the events of December 8th, leaving the circumstances open to interpretation. This lack of specificity suggests a need for further investigation into historical records to fully understand the incident referenced. Together, these sources highlight the capacity for severe and outrageous acts by the British administration during this period, while also indicating areas where further historical inquiry is needed.

# The lack of infrastructure development, such as roads, in the Gold Coast was a significant barrier to economic growth and trade.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant impact of inadequate infrastructure development, particularly roads, on economic growth and trade in the Gold Coast. The General History of Africa highlights that colonial infrastructure, such as roads and railways, was primarily designed to extract resources and connect production areas to the global market, rather than to foster comprehensive economic development or inter-African trade. This uneven distribution of infrastructure posed barriers to economic growth. However, the textbook also notes that local initiatives, particularly in the cocoa industry, managed to thrive despite limited government support and infrastructure, demonstrating that these barriers were not entirely insurmountable. Additionally, the presence of secondary schools in Cape Coast suggests some level of infrastructure development in specific areas. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim by emphasizing the urgent need for roads to transport goods like gold and agricultural products from the interior to the coast for export. They criticize the British government's historical neglect in developing essential infrastructure, which hindered efficient resource extraction and export, limited regional development, and affected both local populations and British economic interests. The articles also highlight the challenges faced by enterprises due to high transportation costs and difficulties in moving machinery and supplies, which deterred investment. Together, these sources illustrate that while local agency could overcome some obstacles, the lack of comprehensive infrastructure development was a significant impediment to the Gold Coast's economic growth and trade.

# The British authorities on the Gold Coast were criticized for their inaction in developing infrastructure, which hindered agriculture, trade, and commerce.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that British authorities on the Gold Coast were criticized for their inaction in developing infrastructure, which hindered agriculture, trade, and commerce. The General History of Africa highlights that the infrastructure established during colonialism, such as roads and railways, was primarily designed to facilitate the extraction and export of resources rather than to promote overall economic development or inter-African connectivity. This infrastructure was inadequate for supporting local agricultural or commercial activities, with the Northern Territories, lacking export crops, being completely ignored in terms of railway development. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention criticism of British authorities for this neglect. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of such criticism, describing the lack of road development as a disgrace to a civilized power and a failure of duty by the Imperial British Government. The articles specifically criticize the neglect of the gold-rich Wassaw region, where the absence of roads and railways impeded mining operations and economic development. They argue that the government's inaction prevented the exploitation of valuable mineral resources and hindered potential trade and commerce, emphasizing the economic benefits that improved infrastructure would bring to both the Gold Coast and British manufacturers. Additionally, the articles note the lack of local legislative power to address these issues, as the Gold Coast was a Crown Colony, leaving the responsibility entirely with the British authorities. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the inadequate infrastructure development and the criticism directed at British authorities for their inaction.

# The British government's neglect of the Gold Coast's gold mining potential was due to its wealth and lack of immediate need for additional resources, leading to missed economic opportunities.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide contrasting perspectives on the British government's approach to the Gold Coast's gold mining potential. The General History of Africa does not directly support the claim that the British neglected the Gold Coast's gold resources due to their wealth and lack of immediate need for additional resources. Instead, it highlights that gold mining was significant, contributing over 40% of the total value of domestic exports in the early 20th century, indicating that the British were aware of and capitalized on these resources. The text also notes that mining was primarily established with foreign capital and profits were repatriated, suggesting deliberate exploitation rather than neglect. Furthermore, it discusses the broader colonial strategy of integrating African economies into the world capitalist system, focusing on raw material extraction. In contrast, The African Times supports the claim by stating that Great Britain, being wealthy, did not feel an urgent need for the Gold Coast's riches, leading to neglect. This is evidenced by the lack of infrastructure, such as railways, to support gold mining operations, resulting in missed economic opportunities. The article also points out that the Gold Coast, as a Crown colony, had no control over its revenue and expenditure, further contributing to the lack of local investment and reliance on British capital. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view, with the textbook emphasizing exploitation within a strategic framework and the news article highlighting neglect due to perceived wealth and missed opportunities.

# The British Government's monopolization of revenues on the Gold Coast prevented the region from achieving "material and sentimental progress."

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that the British Government's monopolization of revenues on the Gold Coast hindered the region's "material and sentimental progress." The General History of Africa highlights how the colonial administration systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from their mineral resources, granting monopolies to imperialist interests and multinational companies like the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST). This exclusion extended to industries such as diamonds, under the guise of market control, and infrastructure development was primarily aimed at resource exploitation for the imperial power's benefit, rather than promoting Africa's economic development. This led to regional disparities and hindered nation-building efforts post-independence, aligning with the essence of the claim. Meanwhile, The African Times articles argue that the region had sufficient revenue, approximately £30,000 a year from Customs' dues and licenses, which could have been used to promote moral, social, material, and Christian advancement. However, the articles criticize British officials for wasting this revenue and monopolizing funds, preventing their effective use for development. They also highlight the mismanagement and lack of effort in addressing crucial issues like road development and transport animal survival. Both sources collectively reinforce the assertion that the British Government's control over revenues was a significant barrier to the Gold Coast's progress, both materially and sentimentally.

# The imposition of taxes and tariffs by the colonial government in the Gold Coast Protectorate was done without representation or input from local leaders and merchants.

The imposition of taxes and tariffs by the colonial government in the Gold Coast Protectorate was executed without representation or input from local leaders and merchants, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details the introduction of a poll tax in 1852, which faced strong resistance due to the disproportionate allocation of revenue, with only a small percentage used for local development and the majority directed towards paying civil servants. This reflects a lack of local input in fiscal decisions. Additionally, the chiefs on the Gold Coast sent a register of grievances protesting against encroachments on their rights, including fiscal matters, underscoring their inadequate representation. The textbook further describes colonial economic policies as primarily benefiting the colonizers, with little regard for the development of the colonized, reinforcing the notion of a lack of local representation. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight that local kings, chiefs, headmen, and merchants were entirely unrepresented in the Legislative Council from January 1868 to April 1872, with no control over the expenditure of their contributions to the Colonial revenue. The articles also express dissatisfaction with the government's actions, such as the non-recognition of the Fanti Confederation and the disorganization of local leadership, further indicating a lack of local input in governance. Together, these sources corroborate the claim of taxation without representation or input from local stakeholders.

# The economic potential of the Gold Coast's gold deposits was recognized by private individuals who took initiative in surveying potential routes for infrastructure development, highlighting the gap left by governmental inaction.

The claim that the economic potential of the Gold Coast's gold deposits was recognized by private individuals who took initiative in surveying potential routes for infrastructure development is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly corroborated by the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook acknowledges the long-standing recognition of the region's mineral wealth by the local population, who had mined and worked gold for generations before the colonial era. However, it does not provide specific information on private initiatives in infrastructure development related to gold mining, instead emphasizing the role of colonial administrations and foreign capital in such developments. In contrast, The African Times articles detail how private individuals, motivated by the significant gold deposits in Wassaw and the challenges posed by inadequate transportation infrastructure, formed a small company to survey routes from the coast to Tacquah, investing 2,500 pounds in the process. This proactive effort by private individuals highlights the gap left by governmental inaction, as the Gold Coast Government and Imperial authorities had not sufficiently addressed the need for improved transit to support mining operations. The articles further emphasize the minimal financial commitment from the Colonial Treasury, underscoring the lack of governmental initiative. Together, these observations illustrate the proactive measures taken by private individuals in response to economic opportunities, contrasting with the government's inertia, and highlight a gap between the claim and the historical account provided in the textbook.

# The continuation of the slave trade in Africa was facilitated by local and international actors, despite efforts to suppress it.

The continuation of the slave trade in Africa was facilitated by a complex interplay of local and international actors, despite efforts to suppress it, as evidenced by both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the role of European merchants and traders, driven by economic interests, who intensified the trade by paying Arab retainers in slaves and demanding open markets for ivory and slaves. Local actors, such as African distributors and slave-traders, were complicit due to economic incentives and the lack of viable alternatives, exemplified by the activities of the Yao, Bisa, and Chikunda merchants. African political and social structures, like the Aro oracle and local chiefs, also perpetuated the trade. Internationally, abolitionist efforts were often ineffective, with countries like Portugal, Brazil, and France continuing illicit operations, and Western powers, including American diplomacy and French interests, showing limited success in suppression. The African Times articles further support this claim by detailing the ongoing slave trade on the coast, particularly after the abandonment of the fort at Quittah, which led to increased trafficking as traders shifted focus from palm oil to slaves. The involvement of Dahoman slave traders and the transportation of slaves to ports like Porto Leguro, Aughwey, and Popo highlight a network of local actors. The British Colonial Government's acknowledgment of its inability to stop the trade, despite it occurring on British territory, and the suggestion of reoccupying forts and deploying naval forces, reflect the challenges faced by international actors. Commodore Wilmot's inquiry and the potential reoccupation of Quittah Fort indicate ongoing, albeit limited, international efforts to address the issue. Both sources illustrate the persistent and multifaceted nature of the slave trade, sustained by local and international factors despite suppression efforts.

# The presence of American currency suggests international involvement in the slave trade despite treaties against it.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the presence of American currency suggests international involvement in the slave trade despite treaties against it. The General History of Africa highlights that American diplomacy managed to evade serious commitment to suppressing the slave trade for forty years, with the trade being legally equated with piracy in 1820 but effectively protected by the compromise of 'checking the flag' in 1842, allowing American slave ships to remain exempt from British suppressive actions. It also notes that American plantation owners continued to import fresh manpower as long as the purchase price was below $600 a head, indicating ongoing economic transactions involving American currency. Additionally, the coexistence of the slave trade and oil trade, with economic changes accelerated by religious and cultural factors, suggests that international involvement persisted despite treaties. The African Times articles further corroborate this by mentioning the circulation of American currency, specifically doubloons and twenty-dollar gold pieces, in the region, attributed to payments for slaves. This implies potential involvement of American entities or individuals in the trade, as these currencies are linked to slave transactions. The articles also describe a thriving slave trade, with traders shifting from palm oil to the more profitable slave trade, and slaves being transported to places like Popo and Ahguay for shipment to Cuba, indicating a broader international network. The mention of a new treaty with the United States, which appears ineffective in curbing the trade, underscores the international dimension of the issue, although the articles do not provide explicit evidence of direct American involvement beyond the circulation of currency. Together, these details suggest that despite treaties and efforts to suppress the trade, international involvement, particularly involving American currency, persisted.

# The abandonment of Quittah Fort by the British led to a resurgence of the slave trade in the region.

The claim that the abandonment of Quittah Fort by the British led to a resurgence of the slave trade in the region is supported by observations from The African Times but not mentioned in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook discusses various aspects of the African slave trade, including British efforts to curtail it and the transition to other forms of commerce like palm oil, but it does not specifically address Quittah Fort or its impact on the slave trade. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed accounts supporting the claim, with correspondents noting that the slave trade became more rampant and open following the fort's abandonment. They report that American doubloons and gold pieces are used as payment for slaves, and that the trade, previously minimal and secretive, has intensified. The articles highlight the return of a slave trade agent to Addah, actively trading slaves for shipment to Cuba, and emphasize the need to reoccupy Quittah Fort to curb this activity. Editorial commentary in the newspaper criticizes the decision to abandon the fort, arguing that it has led to the resurgence of the slave trade along the coast, as evidenced by the situation in Quittah. These observations from The African Times align with the claim, suggesting that the fort's abandonment contributed to the revival of the slave trade in the area.

# The Ashantee war was a significant military conflict involving British forces and the Ashanti Empire in West Africa.

The Ashantee war was a significant military conflict involving British forces and the Ashanti Empire in West Africa, as evidenced by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a comprehensive overview of the conflict, detailing multiple military engagements that began in the 1760s and included notable battles such as the Ashanti victory in 1824, where they defeated British forces and killed their commander, Sir Charles MacCarthy. The British later avenged this defeat at the battle of Dodowa in 1826. The conflict escalated with a well-organized British campaign under General Garnet Wolseley in 1874, leading to the capture and burning of Kumasi, which precipitated the disintegration of the Ashanti Empire and influenced Ashanti reactions during the period 1880-1900. The British expedition against Ashanti in 1896 culminated in the annexation of Ashanti in 1901. The textbook also highlights the Ashanti's diplomatic efforts and internal political dynamics, such as a civil war over succession, adding depth to the understanding of the conflict. Complementing this, The African Times articles underscore the scale and complexity of the military engagement, noting the presence of British troops, including Lieuts. Ganegan and Stewart, and reinforcements like 360 men of the West India Regiment aboard Her Majesty’s ship Himalaya. The articles describe the Ashantis encamped near Cape Coast Castle, engaging in skirmishes, and the logistical challenges faced by the British, including heavy rains, sickness, and the need for government stores delivered by mail steamers. Together, these sources illustrate the significant and multifaceted nature of the military conflict between the British and the Ashanti Empire.

# The harsh climate and terrain of the Ashantee region posed severe health risks to British and West Indian troops, highlighting the environmental difficulties of colonial military campaigns in Africa.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary insights into the claim that the harsh climate and terrain of the Ashantee region posed severe health risks to British and West Indian troops, highlighting the environmental difficulties of colonial military campaigns in Africa. The textbook discusses the broader challenges faced by Europeans in Africa, such as high mortality rates due to diseases like malaria and yellow fever, and the general unpreparedness of European medical systems for tropical diseases. However, it does not specifically address the Ashantee region or the health risks faced by British and West Indian troops there, focusing instead on political and military outcomes. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed support for the claim, describing the onset of the rainy season that rendered the Prah River swollen and the Ashantee bush impassable, leading to the campaign's abandonment. The articles highlight the adverse effects of the climate on troop health, noting high mortality and sickness rates after marching into the bush, and mention poisonous exhalations from uncovered soil and contaminated water. They also criticize the lack of adequate preparations for the troops during the rainy season, exacerbating health risks. While the articles align with the claim by illustrating specific environmental challenges and health risks, they do not provide a broader contextual analysis of colonial military campaigns, a notable difference from the claim. Together, these sources underscore the environmental and health challenges faced by colonial troops in Africa, with the articles offering specific examples from the Ashantee campaign.

# The Ashantees' access to arms and supplies through the Volta River and Dutch settlements highlights the complex trade networks and geopolitical dynamics in West Africa during the colonial period.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the claim regarding the Ashantees' access to arms and supplies through the Volta River and Dutch settlements, highlighting the complex trade networks and geopolitical dynamics in West Africa during the colonial period. The textbook does not explicitly mention the Ashantees' access to arms and supplies via the Volta River and Dutch settlements, nor does it directly address the intricate trade networks and geopolitical dynamics in relation to the Ashantees. Instead, it focuses on the Asante's political and economic influence over various regions, including coastal kingdoms and the north, and their involvement in trade transitions from the slave trade to palm oil and rubber. This absence of specific details on the Volta River and Dutch settlements marks a notable difference from the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim, noting that the Ashantees received significant supplies through the Volta River, which was under both British and Ashantee control, indicating a complex geopolitical landscape. The articles also highlight the Ashantees' acquisition of arms and munitions through Dutch settlements, underscoring the intricate trade networks and multifaceted interactions involving local and European entities during the colonial period. Together, these sources illustrate the broader context of trade and political interactions in West Africa, with the news articles providing specific examples that align with the claim.

# The British military campaigns in Africa, such as those against the Ashanti, were often hindered by logistical challenges, including inadequate medical supplies.

The claim that British military campaigns in Africa, such as those against the Ashanti, were often hindered by logistical challenges, including inadequate medical supplies, is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific details about logistical challenges like inadequate medical supplies affecting British military campaigns. Instead, it focuses on broader aspects of British military and colonial activities, such as the establishment of medical services primarily for European soldiers, strategic and political maneuvers in West Africa, and the high death rates among European soldiers due to tropical diseases. While it mentions the late development of medical interventions for these diseases, it does not explicitly link these issues to logistical challenges in military campaigns. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing logistical shortcomings, such as the absence of port wine among supplies sent to Cape Coast or the Volta, which was crucial for treating dysentery—a common ailment among troops. This oversight is highlighted as a significant concern, reflecting logistical shortcomings in medical provisioning. Additionally, the articles describe the severe impact of the climate on the troops, with many being incapacitated or sent home due to illness, emphasizing the challenges faced by the British military in maintaining the health and effectiveness of their forces. The mention of numerous invalided officers and the overcrowding of medical facilities at Ascension further underscores the logistical difficulties in managing troop health. These details from The African Times align with the claim by illustrating the logistical and medical challenges encountered during the campaigns, highlighting a difference between the claim and the content of the General History of Africa textbook.

# The reliance on West India Regiments suggests the British Empire's dependence on colonial troops for military campaigns in Africa.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the British Empire's reliance on colonial troops for military campaigns in Africa, albeit with different emphases. The General History of Africa highlights the extensive recruitment of African troops by colonial powers, including the British, for various military purposes during and between the World Wars. It notes that African soldiers were employed not only in African campaigns but also to reinforce European armies on other fronts, with the British using them primarily for police functions during the inter-war era and developing forces like the Sudan Defence Force for strategic needs. Compulsory recruitment in East Africa and other regions further illustrates this dependence, though the text does not specifically mention the West India Regiments. In contrast, The African Times articles focus specifically on the West India Regiments, detailing their deployment to relieve other troops at Prahsoo and highlighting their importance through Lord Carnarvon's speech, which underscores their suitability for warfare in African climates and laments their reduced numbers due to "ill-advised parsimony." This suggests a significant reliance on these regiments, aligning with the claim of dependence. While the articles do not explicitly state the British Empire's dependence on these troops, the context and emphasis on the West India Regiments imply their valued role in African campaigns. Together, these sources paint a picture of a British military strategy heavily reliant on colonial troops, with the West India Regiments playing a notable part in this dynamic.

# The British military underestimated the bravery of the Ashantees, attributing their combat tactics to attempts to frighten rather than genuine courage.

The interactions between the British military and the Asante, as detailed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, present a complex picture regarding the claim that the British underestimated the bravery of the Ashantees, attributing their combat tactics to attempts to frighten rather than genuine courage. The General History of Africa emphasizes the Asante's military capabilities and strategic decisions, such as the Asante uprising of 1900 led by Nana Yaa Asantewaa and their earlier military confrontations in the 19th century, highlighting their ability to reunite and resist British advances. However, it does not explicitly mention the British dismissing Asante tactics as mere attempts to frighten, focusing instead on their strategic efforts and diplomatic maneuvers under Prempeh. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a more nuanced view, suggesting that the British did perceive some Ashantee combat tactics, like yelling, singing, and beating drums, as attempts to frighten, aligning with the claim of underestimation. The articles also mention a belief that the Ashantees would not withstand the advance of the white man due to "superstitious awe and dread." Yet, they also describe instances where the Ashantees displayed a "determined front" and "great pluck and fighting powers," forcing British forces to retreat, which indicates a recognition of their bravery. Thus, while the General History of Africa does not support the claim of underestimation, The African Times presents evidence of both underestimation and acknowledgment of the Ashantees' courage.

# The harsh climate and treatment led to significant desertions among French troops in Dahomey, indicating challenges in maintaining colonial military forces in Africa.

The claim that harsh climate and treatment led to significant desertions among French troops in Dahomey, indicating challenges in maintaining colonial military forces in Africa, is addressed differently by the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information about desertions in Dahomey due to harsh climate or treatment. While it discusses various challenges faced by colonial military forces in Africa, such as revolts, resource scarcity, and the impact of European wars, it does not explicitly mention desertions in Dahomey. Instead, it highlights the general difficulties faced by colonial powers in maintaining control, including the need to divert military resources to suppress local uprisings and the logistical challenges posed by the African environment. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide details that support the claim, mentioning "large numbers of desertions among the French troops in Dahomey" and specifically noting that the men of the Foreign Legion "are unable to support the effects of the climate" and are "dissatisfied with the manner in which they are treated." The articles also describe the troops being "constantly attacked by guerilla bands of Dahomeyans," further underscoring the difficulties in maintaining colonial military forces. However, the articles also include official reports that contradict the negative accounts of the army's health, stating it is "as satisfactory as possible," suggesting some conflicting narratives. Overall, while the textbook provides a broader context of colonial military challenges, the news articles offer specific evidence supporting the claim, albeit with some conflicting official perspectives.

# The King of Dahomey profited from the slave trade but was seen as potentially persuadable to abandon it in favor of legitimate commerce.

The claim that the King of Dahomey profited from the slave trade but was seen as potentially persuadable to abandon it in favor of legitimate commerce is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details how King Gezo of Dahomey, who reigned from approximately 1818 to 1858, initially relied heavily on the slave trade as a significant part of the state's economy. However, under the influence of the French trading firm Victor Régis, he was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, which eventually became the dominant factor in Dahomey's export economy. This shift suggests that the king was indeed persuadable to move towards legitimate commerce, further supported by British and French abolitionist efforts and treaties aimed at stopping the slave trade. Despite this, the textbook notes that Dahomey continued the slave trade as long as there were customers, indicating a complex relationship between economic interests and external influences. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the King's financial gain from the slave trade, citing a profit of approximately 10,000 pounds from the shipment of 1,000 slaves. The articles also discuss the possibility of compensating the King for relinquishing the slave trade through legitimate commerce, such as palm oil exportation, and note his expressed desire to engage with Christian civilization and the British government. Commodore Wilmot's mission to Dahomey and the King's respectful reception of him further indicate a belief in the King's potential persuadability, though the articles express skepticism about immediate results due to the lack of power to promise a subsidy to offset financial losses. Together, these sources illustrate both the King's profit from the slave trade and the diplomatic efforts to encourage a shift towards legitimate commerce.

---

# The British government was interested in establishing amicable relations with the King of Dahomey to encourage the end of the slave trade.

The claim that the British government was interested in establishing amicable relations with the King of Dahomey to encourage the end of the slave trade is supported and refuted by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa notes that British and French abolitionist missions visited Dahomey kings to mediate in regional conflicts, indicating some level of diplomatic engagement. However, it also highlights that Dahomey authorities were resistant to demands from British and French delegations to cease the slave trade, as they continued trading with Brazil-based Portuguese dealers. The British anti-slave trade squadron focused more on eliminating the overseas trade in slaves along the coast rather than fostering amicable relations with Dahomey, and the transition to legitimate trade, such as palm oil, was driven more by economic factors than diplomatic relations. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim, noting that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott was equipped with presents by the British government, reflecting a diplomatic approach to engage with the King. The articles express hope that the King's interest in Christian civilization could be leveraged by the British government and highlight the negotiator's desire to detach the King from the slave trade. However, they also acknowledge skepticism about immediate success due to the inability to offer a subsidy to offset the King's financial losses from abandoning the trade. Together, these sources illustrate the complexity of British diplomatic efforts, showing both an interest in engagement and the challenges faced in achieving the desired outcome.

# The King of Dahomey maintained a strategic friendship with England, possibly to secure political or military advantages.

The claim that the King of Dahomey maintained a strategic friendship with England for political or military advantages is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not provide direct evidence supporting this claim, focusing instead on Dahomey's interactions with European powers, particularly France, during the late 19th century. It highlights King Behanzin's confrontational stance against French colonial ambitions and his eventual treaty with France, with no mention of a strategic friendship with England. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the King's enthusiastic reception of Commodore Wilmot, a British representative, and the symbolic elevation of Queen Victoria's portrait, suggesting efforts to establish a close relationship with England. The King referred to Queen Victoria as his "most beloved sister" and expressed intentions to avenge her against the Abeokutans, implying a strategic alignment with British interests. Although the articles do not explicitly state any direct political or military advantages gained, they mention Captain Burton's expected visit and the King's ongoing friendship with England, indicating continued diplomatic engagement. Thus, while the textbook does not corroborate the claim, the news articles suggest the King's efforts to cultivate a favorable relationship with England, albeit without concrete evidence of specific advantages obtained.

# The King of Dahomey showed a willingness to reduce human sacrifices during the annual customs, possibly influenced by external pressures from English representatives like Commodore Wilmot.

The claim that the King of Dahomey showed a willingness to reduce human sacrifices during the annual customs, possibly influenced by external pressures from English representatives like Commodore Wilmot, is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not provide specific information on the King's willingness to reduce human sacrifices or any influence from English representatives, focusing instead on Dahomey's economic and political transitions, such as the shift from the slave trade to palm oil trade and interactions with European powers over trade and territorial control. This absence suggests that the textbook does not cover this aspect of Dahomey's history or the influence of English representatives on the kingdom's customs. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing that during "The Lorsing," or Horse Custom, the King reduced the number of men sacrificed by alternating them with horses, sparing the horses and only killing the men. This change is attributed to potential divine direction or discussions with Commodore Wilmot. The articles also note a shift in the King's attitude towards England, indicating a desire for friendly relations, possibly linked to English influence. Furthermore, the King's interest in sending a mission to England and the impact of Commodore Wilmot's blockade on the slave trade suggest external pressures affecting the King's decisions. These details from The African Times align with the claim, highlighting a potential connection between English influence and the reduction in human sacrifices.

# The British blockade of Dahomey was a strategic move to enforce compliance with British demands, reflecting the broader imperialistic policies of the era.

The claim that the British blockade of Dahomey was a strategic move to enforce compliance with British demands, reflecting broader imperialistic policies, is supported by observations from The African Times but not explicitly detailed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook discusses European interactions with African states and highlights broader imperialistic policies, such as British and French abolitionist missions and British military actions in other regions, but it does not specifically mention a blockade of Dahomey. This absence suggests that if such an event occurred, it was not emphasized in this historical account. In contrast, The African Times provides details supporting the claim, noting that the blockade of Dahomey's sea-coast by British ships was maintained until conditions like the payment of an indemnity were met, indicating its use as leverage for compliance. The articles also mention European traders persuading the King of Dahomey to negotiate, reflecting external pressure to align with British interests. Furthermore, the blockade's impact on the slave trade aligns with British anti-slavery policies, part of their broader imperialistic agenda. While the articles do not explicitly state the blockade as part of a broader imperialistic policy, the strategic use of military power to achieve political and economic objectives is evident.

# The King of Dahomey actively engaged in diplomatic relations by inviting residents to attend annual customs at Abomey.

The claim that the King of Dahomey actively engaged in diplomatic relations by inviting residents to attend annual customs at Abomey is supported by observations from The African Times but not by the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles explicitly mention that the King sent invitations for all residents to attend the annual customs, aligning with the claim. They also describe the King's enthusiastic reception of Commodore Wilmot, a representative of Great Britain, and his expressed affinity for Queen Victoria, suggesting a strategic effort to foster diplomatic ties. However, the articles lack specific details about the nature of the invitations or the residents' responses, which could be significant for historians studying these diplomatic engagements. In contrast, the General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence or details supporting the claim. It mentions the annual customs in the context of human sacrifice but focuses more on the political, military, and economic activities of the Dahomey kingdom, as well as its interactions with European powers and neighboring states. The absence of information related to the claim in the textbook suggests that this aspect of Dahomey's diplomatic practices may not be well-documented according to this source.

# The use of cowries as currency by the King of Dahomey facilitated the establishment of French factories and trade dominance in the region.

The claim that the use of cowries as currency by the King of Dahomey facilitated the establishment of French factories and trade dominance in the region is addressed differently by the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide any direct link between cowries and the establishment of French factories or trade dominance in Dahomey. It discusses the use of cowries in West Africa, particularly in the Sokoto caliphate, and focuses on the transition from the slave trade to legitimate trade, such as palm oil, along with the political and military interactions between Dahomey and France, including conflicts over Porto Novo and the eventual French conquest. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing how a dealer from Marseilles, M. Regis, leveraged the cowrie-based economy to establish several factories in Dahomey. This suggests that cowries played a role in allowing French traders to gain a foothold in the region. However, the articles do not explicitly mention French "trade dominance" or provide a comprehensive overview of the broader economic impact, focusing instead on specific instances of trade facilitated by cowries. Additionally, the articles include information on diplomatic relations between Dahomey and Great Britain, which is unrelated to the claim. The absence of information on cowries in relation to French trade dominance in the General History of Africa and the lack of explicit mention of "trade dominance" in The African Times are notable differences from the claim.

# The presence and involvement of Mr. Payne in England reflect a level of respect and recognition for African professionals and contributions during the late 19th century.

The claim regarding the presence and involvement of Mr. Payne in England reflecting a level of respect and recognition for African professionals during the late 19th century is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook mentions J. A. Otunba Payne as part of the Nigerian elite but does not elaborate on his activities or recognition in England, focusing instead on the emergence of an educated African elite in West Africa and their contributions to missionary and educational activities, as well as the development of pan-Africanism and African racial consciousness. In contrast, The African Times provides several details supporting the claim, highlighting Mr. Payne's involvement in prestigious events and meetings, such as the Committee Meeting of the British & Foreign Bible Society, the annual meeting of the Victoria Institute, and the Foresters' High Court. His interactions with notable figures, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and the Lord Mayor of London, further reflect the recognition he received. Additionally, Mr. Payne's role in proposing resolutions and addressing gatherings, such as the banquet by the executive committee in Cambridge, demonstrates his active participation and the esteem in which he was held. While these articles highlight Mr. Payne's individual experiences, they do not explicitly discuss broader societal attitudes towards African professionals, which may not fully represent the general perception of African contributions at the time.

# The discussions and meetings in England involving Mr. Payne and other Africans highlight the transcontinental connections and exchanges between Africa and Europe during this period.

The discussions and meetings in England involving Mr. Payne and other Africans underscore the transcontinental connections and exchanges between Africa and Europe during this period. While the General History of Africa textbook does not specifically mention Mr. Payne or his meetings in England, it highlights the broader context of African-European interactions, such as the presence of Africans in Europe from the fifteenth century onwards, the pan-Africanist movement, and the participation of Africans in conferences organized by figures like W. E. B. Du Bois. These activities illustrate the movement of African students to Europe and the influence of pan-Africanism, supporting the theme of African-European connections. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide specific details about Mr. Payne, a well-known native of West Africa, and his engagements in England. He and his wife were warmly received by prominent figures and institutions, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and the Lord Mayor of London. Mr. Payne actively participated in meetings of the Church Missionary Society, the British & Foreign Bible Society, and the Victoria Institute, and was recognized for promoting the principles of Forestry in West Africa at the Foresters' High Court in Cambridge. These interactions highlight the active participation of Africans in significant social and intellectual circles in Europe, reinforcing the notion of interconnectedness between Africa and Europe. While the textbook provides a general overview of transcontinental exchanges, the articles from The African Times offer a rich context of Mr. Payne's specific experiences, illustrating the vibrant exchanges and receptions that characterized the period.

# Mr. Payne's active participation in various societies and meetings in England reflects the involvement of Africans in international intellectual and social circles.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about Mr. Payne's active participation in various societies and meetings in England. While it mentions several African intellectuals, such as James Africanus Horton and Edward Wilmot Blyden, and their involvement in international intellectual and social circles, it lacks direct evidence or mention of Mr. Payne's activities in England. This absence suggests that his specific contributions or participation in international circles may not have been documented or emphasized in this particular historical account. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide several details supporting the claim of Mr. Payne's active participation in various societies and meetings in England, reflecting the involvement of Africans in international intellectual and social circles. Mr. Payne attended committee meetings of the Church Missionary Society and the British & Foreign Bible Society, shared insights about his work in Lagos, and participated in the annual meeting of the Victoria Institute, where he seconded a resolution and praised Sir George Stokes. He was also involved in the Foresters' High Court in Cambridge, acknowledged for his contributions to Forestry in West Africa, and interacted with notable figures such as the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and members of the Royal Colonial Institute. These activities underscore Mr. Payne's active engagement in international circles, aligning with the claim of African involvement in such domains, and provide a rich account of his participation, highlighting the presence and influence of Africans in these settings.

# The British authorities' abandonment of territories on the Gold Coast contributed to the resurgence of the slave trade in the region.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the British authorities' abandonment of territories on the Gold Coast contributed to the resurgence of the slave trade in the region. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence supporting this claim; instead, it highlights British efforts to suppress the slave trade through treaties with local chiefs and the establishment of naval squadrons to enforce these agreements. The textbook emphasizes the transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, particularly in palm oil, and notes the British government's decision to resume direct control of coastal settlements in 1843, suggesting a continued British presence rather than abandonment. Conversely, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the "virtual abandonment" of Quittah by British authorities, which allegedly led to increased slave-trading activities. The articles criticize the British Government for failing to take effective measures to stop these practices, resulting in the destruction of legitimate commerce and the continuation of the slave trade. They argue for the re-occupation of Addah and Quittah to curb the slave trade, implying that British control could have mitigated the issue. Thus, while the textbook emphasizes a decline in the slave trade due to British intervention, the news articles suggest that a lack of British presence facilitated its resurgence in certain areas.

# The British Protectorate on the Gold Coast failed in its duty by permitting the transfer and sale of slaves, despite its official stance against slavery.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the British Protectorate on the Gold Coast failed in its duty by permitting the transfer and sale of slaves, despite its official stance against slavery. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence or details supporting or refuting this claim. Instead, it discusses the decline of the slave trade, the diplomatic and military efforts to suppress it, and the socio-political dynamics in West Africa, including the Gold Coast, without specifically mentioning any failure by the British Protectorate to prevent slave transfers and sales. The text highlights British efforts to curb the slave trade through treaties and military actions, suggesting a focus on their anti-slavery initiatives. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing how the British Protectorate allowed the transfer and sale of slaves within its jurisdiction, despite Great Britain's official opposition to slavery. The articles criticize the Protectorate for permitting a foreign slave trade, notably by the Ashantees near Cape Coast Castle, and for local authorities ignoring these activities, indicating a disconnect between the official anti-slavery stance and actions on the ground. This inconsistency aligns with the claim of a failure in duty, highlighting a notable difference between the two sources.

# The abolition of slavery on the Gold Coast marked a significant turning point in West African history, leading to potential long-term benefits despite initial challenges.

The abolition of slavery on the Gold Coast marked a significant turning point in West African history, leading to potential long-term benefits despite initial challenges, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details how the abolition of the slave trade, a major component of the Gold Coast's economy, prompted a shift towards the export of palm oil and later rubber, laying the groundwork for structural economic changes. This transition to 'legitimate' trade was facilitated by the adaptive capacity of indigenous societies, indicating potential long-term economic benefits. The abolitionist movement also contributed to modernization, with liberated Africans forming a first-generation middle class, bringing skills and cultural models from Victorian England and Brazil. However, the transition faced challenges, as the abolition did not immediately disrupt the export market's vitality, and illicit trade persisted for some time. The British presence and treaties with local rulers gradually eroded local power, leading to political changes and the eventual establishment of colonial states. The African Times articles echo these observations, describing the emancipation as a pivotal event that transformed the region's socio-political landscape. They acknowledge the initial "temporary inconveniences" and "commotion" but emphasize the "incalculable benefits" and the gradual emergence of positive outcomes, underscoring the role of Great Britain as a guiding force in this transition. Together, these sources illustrate the transformative impact of slavery's abolition on the Gold Coast, highlighting both the challenges and the potential for fostering progress and self-dependence in West Africa.

# The British administration on the West Coast of Africa faced resistance and criticism from local authorities and individuals, indicating tensions between colonial powers and indigenous leaders.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view of the resistance and criticism faced by the British administration on the West Coast of Africa, highlighting the tensions between colonial powers and indigenous leaders. The textbook details various instances of resistance, such as the confrontation by the kingdom of Benin against British forces in 1897, and the defiance of Jaja of Opobo, who resisted British demands to stop levying duties on English traders. It also highlights the formation of clubs and associations by educated Africans, like the Aborigines Rights Protection Society in the Gold Coast, to protest against colonial abuses, and mentions the frustration of educated Africans and traders in Sierra Leone, which led to riots and strikes in 1919. Additionally, the opposition of African leaders like Prempeh I of Asante and Wobogo of the Mossi to colonial offers underscores their determination to maintain sovereignty. However, the text also notes that some communities, such as those in the Niger Delta, eventually surrendered to British control, indicating a complex response to colonial rule. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles provide evidence of resistance and criticism through letters from C. S. Salmon, Acting-Administrator, demanding compliance from local leaders like the Kings of Abbra or Mankessim, suggesting tension with indigenous authorities. A letter from F. Fitzgerald, Editor of the African Times, to the Earl of Kimberley criticizes the Cape Coast authorities for their vexatious actions, perceived as harmful to individuals and damaging to the British Government's reputation among locals. This internal dissent and dissatisfaction with the colonial administration's approach, along with concerns about the appointment of a new Administrator to the Cape Coast, further indicate existing tensions and criticism of past administrations. Together, these sources illustrate both local resistance and internal criticism of British colonial practices, aligning with the claim of tensions between colonial powers and indigenous leaders.

# The British settlements on the West Coast of Africa were initially established to support the slave trade but later became instrumental in efforts to suppress it.

The claim that British settlements on the West Coast of Africa transitioned from supporting the slave trade to becoming instrumental in its suppression is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. Initially, these settlements were closely associated with the slave trade, as evidenced by the significant number of Africans transported to the Americas. However, following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, a notable shift occurred. The General History of Africa highlights British efforts to suppress the trade, including the establishment of naval squadrons, treaties with local rulers, and the creation of Courts of Mixed Commissions to try captured slave ship captains. The British also promoted 'legitimate trade' in goods other than slaves, which gradually diminished the power of local rulers and led to the establishment of British judicial systems. The African Times echoes this transformation, with Mr. E. H. K. Karskoth-Hugessen, M.P., acknowledging the settlements' original purpose for the slave trade but noting a shift to a "wiser and more humane policy" aimed at suppression. The articles further emphasize the role of these settlements as centers for spreading Christianity and civilization into Africa's interior, underscoring their instrumental role in anti-slavery efforts. Additionally, the British government's recognition of Sierra Leoneans as subjects of the Crown in 1853 is noted as a significant step towards a structured and anti-slavery presence. Together, these sources detail the historical transformation of British settlements from facilitating the slave trade to playing a crucial role in its suppression.

# The British government believed that their rule in West Africa was justified until African communities were deemed capable of self-governance.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced understanding of the British government's justification for their rule in West Africa, particularly in relation to the claim that their governance was deemed necessary until African communities were capable of self-governance. The General History of Africa highlights the British government's paternalistic approach, as seen in the 1923 White Paper on Kenya, which established 'native paramountcy' and framed British rule as a 'trust on behalf of the African populations.' This suggests a belief in a responsibility to guide African societies, although the textbook also points out the authoritarian nature of colonial rule, where genuine political power was not conferred upon Africans, indicating a discrepancy between the claim and actual practices. The National Congress of British West Africa's desire for political development under British oversight further reflects a belief in gradual progress towards self-governance. In contrast, The African Times articles suggest that British politicians did not prioritize West African settlements for commercial or territorial gains but rather valued the spread of Gospel truth, which they believed could be better achieved under British protection. This aligns with the moral justification for maintaining control until African communities were deemed advanced enough for self-governance. Additionally, the articles note a shift in British policy towards increasing local revenues to support development, indicating a commitment to improving infrastructure and governance as a step towards self-governance. However, the articles do not explicitly state that British rule was justified solely on the basis of African readiness for self-governance, suggesting a blend of economic, moral, and developmental motivations. Together, these sources provide a complex picture of British motivations, revealing both support for and contradictions to the claim.

# The British viewed the development of African resources as essential and beneficial for both the colonizers and the colonized.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a multifaceted view of the British perspective on the development of African resources, highlighting both supportive and critical aspects of the claim that such development was seen as beneficial for both the colonizers and the colonized. The "General History of Africa" presents a nuanced picture, acknowledging efforts by the British colonial administration, such as in Sudan, to develop infrastructure and modern agricultural systems, which could suggest potential benefits for the colonized. It also notes the British recognition of African colonies' economic potential to promote British interests, indicating a focus on resource development. However, it underscores the exploitative nature of British colonialism, where the primary aim was to facilitate British commerce and capital, often at the expense of African resources and labor. The colonial economies were structured to serve British needs, with little reciprocity, and African producers were disadvantaged in trade, leading to exploitative integration into the world capitalist system. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the moral and civilizing mission of resource development, portraying it as a "noble and Christian determination" to spread civilization and Christianity. They highlight efforts to abolish domestic slavery, educate the people, and improve infrastructure in colonies like the Gold Coast and Lagos, suggesting benefits for the colonized through industrial progress and for the colonizers by expanding British influence. While the articles focus on moral and civilizational aspects, they do not explicitly address the economic benefits for the colonizers, which is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, while both sources acknowledge efforts to develop African resources, the primary motivation often leaned towards benefiting the colonizers, with varying degrees of benefit for the colonized.

# The reluctance to bring Africans to England was attributed to financial concerns rather than a lack of faith in English civilization or religion.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that the reluctance to bring Africans to England was attributed to financial concerns rather than a lack of faith in English civilization or religion. The General History of Africa does not directly address this specific claim, focusing instead on the dynamics of colonial administration, economic exploitation, and resistance within Africa. It highlights the significant role of economic considerations in colonial policies, such as the investment of African savings in England and the economic manipulation of African resources, suggesting that financial concerns were indeed influential in colonial decision-making. However, it does not specifically relate these concerns to the reluctance to bring Africans to England, indicating a gap in the discussion of motivations behind such movements. In contrast, The African Times news articles explicitly support the claim, criticizing the English government's policy of requiring African nations like Dahomey and Ashantee to renounce the slave trade and adopt civilized practices before allowing their nobles to visit England. The articles argue that this reluctance stems not from a lack of confidence in English civilization or religion, but from the financial cost and trouble involved. They suggest that the English government is using a "false and hypocritical exaction" as a pretext, with the real barrier being the expense of a few thousand pounds, which they claim would be repaid many times over by the benefits of civilizing these nations. Together, these sources highlight the complexity of motivations behind colonial policies, with The African Times providing a more direct critique of financial concerns as a primary factor.

# The British administration at Cape Coast was seen as a protector against Ashanti aggression and other hostile influences.

The claim that the British administration at Cape Coast was seen as a protector against Ashanti aggression and other hostile influences is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details the long-standing confrontation between the Asante and the British, highlighting British efforts to counter Asante military power, such as General Garnet Wolseley's decisive campaign in 1874, which led to the sacking of Kumasi and the Treaty of Fomena. This treaty recognized the independence of southern states from Asante control, suggesting that the British were perceived as a counterbalance to Asante dominance. The British also encouraged member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, further indicating a protective stance. Coastal chiefs' openness to emancipation and fear of Asante attacks imply that the British presence was seen as protective, though the text also notes the complexities of British involvement, including strategic interests and divide-and-conquer tactics. Similarly, The African Times articles support the claim by mentioning the hope for freedom from Ashanti aggression through British regulation and approval, portraying the British as a sovereign protector. The desire for a wise and benevolent Christian ruler at Cape Coast underscores the expectation of protection and positive governance. However, the articles also criticize past British administration as "profligate incompetency," suggesting that the effectiveness of this protection was questioned. Together, these sources provide evidence that aligns with the claim while presenting a nuanced view of British motivations and actions.

# The British government and public figures believed that their colonial actions were divinely sanctioned and part of a greater plan.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the British government and public figures believed their colonial actions were divinely sanctioned and part of a greater plan. The General History of Africa does not explicitly support this claim, focusing instead on the economic, political, and strategic motivations behind British colonial actions. It highlights the British interest in promoting commerce, exploiting economic opportunities, and maintaining control over African territories through indirect rule, manipulation of local politics, and strategic alliances with local leaders. While missionaries are mentioned as paving the way for colonialism, their motivations are portrayed as driven by religious and economic goals rather than a belief in divine sanction. The text emphasizes the British government's pragmatic approach to colonial administration, prioritizing economic exploitation and political control over religious or divine justification. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide details that support the claim, explicitly mentioning a belief in divine guidance in Britain's territorial acquisitions and portraying Britain's role as a divinely ordained leader in human progress. The articles describe colonial actions as motivated by "Christian zeal" and a sense of moral and religious duty to civilize and Christianize other parts of the world, aligning closely with the claim of a perceived divine mandate and moral responsibility in British colonial endeavors.

# The potential French colonization of Madagascar raised concerns about the revival of the slave trade under the guise of free apprenticeships.

The potential French colonization of Madagascar raised concerns about the revival of the slave trade under the guise of free apprenticeships, a claim that is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with different emphases. The General History of Africa textbook does not explicitly mention these concerns in the context of French colonization; however, it provides a historical backdrop of slavery and labor exploitation in Madagascar. It notes that while the slave trade was banned in regions under Malagasy control following the Anglo-Malagasy Treaty of 1847, it persisted in the form of contract labor in certain areas. The textbook also describes forced labor systems like the SMOTIG imposed by the French colonial administration, which the Malagasy perceived as "slavery in disguise." These details underscore the exploitation and forced labor practices during colonial times but do not directly address the specific claim about free apprenticeships. In contrast, The African Times news articles explicitly support the claim by expressing apprehension that French colonial ambitions in Madagascar could lead to a renewed demand for labor, with fears of a resurgence of the foreign slave trade from East Africa. The articles suggest that such labor might be labeled as "free apprenticeships," which would, in reality, be a form of bondage with associated cruelties. This aligns with the claim by highlighting the potential for exploitation and the reintroduction of oppressive labor practices under colonial rule, emphasizing the risk of such developments if France were to take possession of Madagascar.

# The involvement of African Christian ministers, like Rev. James Johnson, was seen as crucial in promoting Christianity and civilization in Lagos.

The involvement of African Christian ministers, such as Rev. James Johnson, was seen as crucial in promoting Christianity and civilization in Lagos, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights Rev. James Johnson's significant role in the Christian ministry, where he advocated for Nigerian nationalism and Ethiopianism, and promoted the idea of an independent African Church led by Africans. His efforts, particularly at the Breadfruit Church in Lagos, and his advocacy for African evangelization, underscore his pivotal role in advancing Christianity. The broader impact of African Christian ministers and missionaries in spreading Christianity and education contributed to the modernization process in West Africa, including Lagos. However, the textbook also notes the resistance and challenges faced by African ministers from European missionaries, exemplified by Johnson's removal from Yorubaland due to racial prejudices, adding complexity to their efforts. Similarly, The African Times article underscores Johnson's crucial role, expressing hope that his interaction with ex-King Docemo would lead to significant positive outcomes. The article emphasizes the importance of moving away from "degrading superstitions" and embracing "good tidings," portraying African Christian ministers as instrumental in this transformative shift towards Christian civilization. Both sources align in their portrayal of African Christian ministers as key figures in advancing Christianity and civilization in Lagos, without refuting the claim.

# The British commitment to development in West Africa was perceived as irreversible, with national honor at stake, compelling them to continue their efforts.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the British commitment to development in West Africa was perceived as irreversible, with national honor at stake. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced view, suggesting that British involvement was more about maintaining influence and control rather than a dedicated commitment to development. It highlights tactics like "divide and conquer" and the exploitation of local rivalries, as well as the failure of plantation systems and limited land alienation, indicating that economic development was not as prioritized as the claim implies. Furthermore, the African response was largely one of resistance, challenging the notion of an irreversible commitment. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by describing a significant shift in British policy from reducing Imperial expenses to increasing local revenues for development, marking a "wondrous change in Imperial policy." The articles emphasize the role of divine providence and national honor, suggesting that Britain was seen as "irrevocably committed" to its role in African Christian civilization, despite initial reluctance. While the articles do not explicitly mention national honor as a motivating factor, they align closely with the idea of an irreversible commitment driven by both external and internal pressures. Together, these sources provide a complex picture of British actions in West Africa, with the textbook focusing on control and resistance, and the articles highlighting a perceived commitment to development.

# The portrayal of Africa as having a static or primitive past is a misrepresentation contradicted by archaeological evidence.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting engagements with the claim that the portrayal of Africa as having a static or primitive past is a misrepresentation contradicted by archaeological evidence. The General History of Africa provides a robust argument against the static portrayal of Africa, emphasizing the "myth" of a static past and highlighting the wealth of oral material and new written sources that have enriched the understanding of African history, particularly in the nineteenth century. It underscores that significant changes in Africa were not solely due to European influence but were also driven by internal dynamics, such as those in Egypt and northern Nguni society, thereby challenging the Eurocentric view that African history is primarily defined by European trade and colonization. However, the text does not specifically mention archaeological evidence, focusing instead on oral traditions and historical narratives. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not directly address the claim or engage with Africa's historical portrayal or archaeological evidence. The articles cover contemporary issues, such as financial meetings, legal cases, and technological advancements, which are unrelated to the historical narrative of Africa. This absence of information on Africa's past or archaeological findings in The African Times highlights a lack of engagement with the claim, suggesting that the publication, at least in these excerpts, does not contribute to the discourse on Africa's historical portrayal or its archaeological evidence.

---

# The trans-Saharan trade routes were crucial in facilitating cultural and economic exchanges between Africa and other regions.

The claim that the trans-Saharan trade routes were crucial in facilitating cultural and economic exchanges between Africa and other regions is substantially supported by observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook. The text highlights the significant role of these trade routes in connecting Saharan merchants with the world economy through the exchange of diverse commodities such as ostrich feathers, slaves, gold, and ivory with European markets. It underscores the economic importance of these exchanges by detailing the involvement of various nomadic and sedentary groups in organizing, financing, and transporting goods. The integration of African regions through these routes led to increased intra-African contacts and opened Africa's hinterland to European and Arab/Swahili influence, transforming local economies and shifting trade items from the slave trade to legitimate trade. Cultural exchanges are also implied through the spread of Islam and the influence of European goods and practices. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide any information directly related to the trans-Saharan trade routes or their role in cultural and economic exchanges. Instead, they cover unrelated topics such as population growth, postal rate changes, and railway construction, highlighting a notable absence of discussion on historical trade routes or cultural interactions involving Africa. This difference underscores the textbook's focus on the pivotal role of trans-Saharan trade in fostering economic and cultural interactions, which is not addressed in the news articles.

---

# The empires of Mali and Songhai were powerful centers of trade and cultural exchange in Africa.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveal a notable absence of direct discussion regarding the empires of Mali and Songhai as powerful centers of trade and cultural exchange in Africa. The textbook provides a broader context of trade and cultural interactions in Africa, particularly through the trans-Saharan trade routes, which were crucial to the economic prosperity of both Mali and Songhai. It mentions the exchange of goods such as gold, slaves, and salt, and highlights the importance of trade routes and the exchange of textiles, livestock, and agricultural products across various African regions. This aligns with the historical role of Mali and Songhai as trade hubs, although the text primarily focuses on the nineteenth century and later periods, emphasizing the decline of the slave trade and the rise of new economic activities rather than the specific historical periods of these empires' prominence. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide any direct information related to the claim, as they focus on unrelated topics such as a French decree honoring a British barrister, the passage of a slave emancipation bill in Porto Rico, statistics on gold bullion and bank rates, and the success of an electric railway in Berlin. This absence of any mention of African empires or trade in the articles highlights a significant difference, as the content does not address African history or trade dynamics, which are central to the claim about the Mali and Songhai empires. This lack of related information underscores the articles' focus on contemporary European and American issues rather than African historical contexts.

# The arbitrary borders drawn by colonial powers contributed to ethnic tensions and conflicts in post-colonial Africa.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting engagements with the claim that the arbitrary borders drawn by colonial powers contributed to ethnic tensions and conflicts in post-colonial Africa. The textbook provides substantial support for this claim, detailing how colonial boundaries often cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states, and kingdoms, leading to social disruption and displacement. It cites examples such as the Bakongo being divided among Angola, Belgian Congo, French Congo, and Gabon, and the Somali people being split among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Djibouti, which resulted in chronic border disputes between independent African states like Sudan and Uganda, Somalia and Ethiopia, and Nigeria and Cameroon. The text further discusses how these arbitrary boundaries created nation-states composed of diverse peoples with different cultures and languages, complicating nation-building efforts, and how colonial practices of playing ethnic groups against each other exacerbated tensions. In contrast, the excerpts from The African Times news articles do not contain any information directly related to the claim. While the articles might discuss historical events or associations relevant to the time, they do not explicitly address the issue of colonial borders or their impact on ethnic tensions. This absence of information highlights a notable difference, as the articles do not engage with the specific topic of colonial borders and their long-term effects on African societies, a significant theme in historical analyses of post-colonial Africa.

# The Arab slave trade and the Atlantic slave trade had profound and lasting impacts on African societies, disrupting social structures and economies.

The "General History of Africa" textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim that both the Arab slave trade and the Atlantic slave trade had profound and lasting impacts on African societies, disrupting social structures and economies. It highlights how the slave trade led to the destruction of social and political structures, as individuals were often captured through violence, raids, and wars, leading to social disintegration. Economically, the slave trade disrupted normal agricultural activities and replaced local industries with imported goods, undermining local economies. The text also notes the shift in economic zones, where slave labor became integral to production, further entrenching social oppression and economic dependency. The introduction of new crops and modest technological innovations did not compensate for the overall economic retardation caused by the slave trade. Additionally, the abolition of the slave trade led to internal conflicts and a desperate search for new commodities, further illustrating the lasting economic disruptions. The demographic impact was significant, with large portions of populations being enslaved, leading to underpopulated areas and social inequalities. In contrast, the African Times news articles do not contain any information directly related to the claim about the impacts of the Arab and Atlantic slave trades on African societies. Instead, they discuss topics such as national piety, public trust in divine sovereignty, and the financial and operational aspects of a company's annual general meeting, without mentioning African societies, social structures, economies, or the historical context of the slave trades. This absence of relevant information in the articles highlights a notable difference, as they do not address the historical impacts of the slave trades on Africa, a significant topic for historians studying the region's history.

# The transatlantic slave trade had a profound and lasting impact on Africa's societies and economies.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present a contrasting focus on the topic of the transatlantic slave trade's impact on Africa's societies and economies. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim that the transatlantic slave trade had a profound and lasting impact, highlighting its disruptive nature through the destruction of social and political structures via violence, kidnapping, and wars. Economically, it caused significant dislocation, undermining local industries and agriculture, and fostering a dependency on the world trading system, which intensified underdevelopment. The export of productive members of society and the introduction of diseases further exacerbated these issues. The shift from the slave trade to export agriculture redistributed income but did not bring about technological advancement, leaving Africa's economy vulnerable. Additionally, social stratification and class antagonisms arose, with continued reliance on slave labor in various regions. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide information directly related to the transatlantic slave trade or its impact. Instead, they focus on contemporary legal and financial matters, such as a legal case involving financial arrangements and bankruptcy issues, and the financial status of a company and its shares. This absence of historical analysis in the articles highlights their focus on current events rather than the historical impacts of the slave trade, underscoring the difference in content between the two sources.

# European colonization significantly altered Africa's political, social, and economic landscapes, leading to exploitation and territorial division.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that European colonization significantly altered Africa's political, social, and economic landscapes, leading to exploitation and territorial division. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim, highlighting the loss of sovereignty of African states, the imposition of fixed colonial boundaries that ignored pre-existing ethnic and political divisions, and the introduction of European bureaucratic structures that disrupted traditional governance. It also discusses the negative social impacts, such as racial discrimination, the deterioration of women's status, and the creation of urban-rural divides, alongside the exploitative colonial economy that forced Africans into labor and appropriated land, resulting in widespread poverty and social unrest. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not directly address the claim, focusing instead on topics like financial matters, legal judgments, market conditions, religious appeals, and parliamentary proceedings in the United Kingdom. This absence of direct reference to colonization and its consequences on Africa suggests that the articles are more concerned with European and British domestic issues, which might reflect the publication's editorial focus or the nature of its audience during that period. This divergence highlights the comprehensive account of colonization's impact provided by the textbook, while the news articles' lack of discussion on the topic could be of interest to historians examining editorial priorities of the time.

# The arrival of European colonizers in the late 15th century marked a turning point that led to the exploitation of Africa's resources and people.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the arrival of European colonizers in the late 15th century marked a turning point leading to the exploitation of Africa's resources and people. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, highlighting forced labor, malnutrition, and land appropriation in regions like French Africa, Kenya, and Southern Rhodesia. It discusses the monopolization of fertile lands and trade by European and Asiatic settlers, the role of missionaries in facilitating colonialism, and the transformation of Africa's economic relations with Europe, culminating in the partition of Africa. The impact of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and Africa's incorporation into the capitalist world-economy further align with the exploitation narrative. However, the textbook also acknowledges pre-existing trade networks and the adaptation of African systems to new economic demands, suggesting a more complex interaction than mere exploitation. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not directly reference the arrival of European colonizers or the exploitation of Africa, focusing instead on topics like UK political elections, the Jewish population in Jerusalem, ore mining, political commentary on France, the coronation of Alexander III in Russia, and a company's insolvency. This absence of relevant information in the articles highlights a significant difference, as they do not address the historical context of European colonization in Africa or its impacts, which would be of interest to historians studying the exploitation of Africa's resources and people.

# Trade routes across the Sahara were instrumental in connecting African societies with Europe and Asia, fostering cultural and economic exchanges.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that trade routes across the Sahara were instrumental in connecting African societies with Europe and Asia, fostering cultural and economic exchanges. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, highlighting how trans-Saharan trade routes facilitated the movement of commodities such as ostrich feathers, ivory, and slaves from Africa to Europe, while European goods like cotton textiles and firearms were imported into Africa. It emphasizes the role of Saharan merchants, nomadic groups, and oasis dwellers in organizing and financing this trade, which linked the Sahelian zones with Europe through North Africa. Additionally, the textbook notes the exchange of ideas and cultural practices, such as the spread of Islamic scholarship and the influence of religious orders like the Sanüsiyya, although it primarily focuses on economic exchanges with Europe and less on connections with Asia. The decline of these trade routes in the late nineteenth century due to European colonization and modern transportation methods is also mentioned, underscoring their historical significance. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide any information related to the claim, focusing instead on unrelated topics such as iron production in the United States, a rowing race between Cambridge and Oxford, a political assassination in Constantinople, endorsements of a cordial, and legislative matters in Great Britain and Ireland. This absence of information on the claim in the news articles highlights a significant difference, as they do not engage with the historical context of African trade routes or their impact on intercontinental connections.

# The spread of Islam in Africa was a major factor in the development of powerful empires and significantly impacted the continent's cultural and political landscapes.

The "General History of Africa" textbook provides substantial support for the claim that the spread of Islam in Africa was a major factor in the development of powerful empires and significantly impacted the continent's cultural and political landscapes. It details how Islamic revolutions, or djihads, led to the creation of large empires such as the Sokoto Caliphate, the Massina Empire, and the empire of Samori Ture, reshaping political authority in the Western Sudan. The replacement of traditional ruling elites with new Islamic clerics marked a significant political shift. Culturally, Islam introduced the Islamic calendar, Arabic loanwords, and Islamic architecture, music, and titles, enriching African languages and cultures. The text also highlights Islam's role in unifying diverse peoples under theocratic states and fostering a sense of Islamic solidarity across the Sudanic belt. Furthermore, during the colonial period, Islam expanded due to its adaptability to African traditions and its role as a unifying force amidst colonial disruptions. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide any information related to the spread of Islam in Africa or its impact on the development of powerful empires and the continent's cultural and political landscapes. Instead, they focus on a speech by Mr. Rainy, an advertisement for a medicinal product by Mackey, Mackey & Co., and a brief mention of a death notice, with no mention of Islam, African empires, or related cultural and political changes. This absence of relevant information highlights a notable difference, as the articles do not address the historical and cultural themes outlined in the claim.

# The transatlantic slave trade had a profound impact on African societies, contributing to long-term demographic and social changes.

The "General History of Africa" textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim that the transatlantic slave trade had a profound impact on African societies, contributing to long-term demographic and social changes. It highlights the massive loss of population due to the slave trade, leading to underpopulation and underdevelopment in many African regions. The text describes how the slave trade disrupted social and political structures, with violence and instability becoming prevalent as communities were raided for slaves. The economic impact was significant, as local industries were undermined by the importation of foreign goods in exchange for slaves. Demographic changes are illustrated by emigration rates and the substantial loss of life during capture and transport. Even after the abolition of the slave trade, structural imbalances persisted, with slavery continuing in various forms, affecting social hierarchies and labor systems. Cultural and social transformations also resulted from the return of liberated slaves and the integration of African influences into American societies. In contrast, the African Times news articles do not contain any information related to the claim about the transatlantic slave trade's impact on African societies. The articles are vague and lack specific details or context for meaningful comparison or association with the claim, highlighting a significant gap in the coverage of historical issues within the African Times. This absence of relevant content is an interesting difference, as an expert historian would likely note this omission as a significant gap in the coverage of historical issues within the African Times articles.

# Africa's history includes some of the world's earliest human civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt and the Kingdom of Kush.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveal a notable absence of information regarding Africa's history as home to some of the world's earliest human civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt and the Kingdom of Kush. The textbook primarily addresses topics like African resistance to European colonization, economic developments in North Africa, cultural and linguistic divisions, the impact of Islam, demographic changes due to external influences, and factors facilitating European conquest. Although Ancient Egypt is briefly mentioned in the context of resistance against European partition and occupation, there is no explicit discussion of its historical significance as an early civilization, and the Kingdom of Kush is not mentioned at all. Similarly, The African Times articles focus on financial matters, legal and political developments, and notable events and obituaries unrelated to Africa's ancient civilizations. This lack of relevant historical context in both sources highlights a divergence from the claim about Africa's early civilizations, as neither provides information to support or refute the historical importance of Ancient Egypt and the Kingdom of Kush.

# The trans-Saharan trade routes were crucial in linking Africa to Europe and Asia, facilitating cultural and economic exchanges.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that trans-Saharan trade routes were crucial in linking Africa to Europe and Asia, facilitating cultural and economic exchanges. The General History of Africa provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, emphasizing the role of trans-Saharan trade in connecting the Sahelian zones with Europe through North Africa, serving as a transit and transfer nexus. It details the diverse commodities exchanged, such as ostrich feathers, hides, and gold, alongside the import of European goods like cotton textiles and firearms, highlighting significant economic exchanges. The involvement of Mediterranean ports and European financial backing further underscores the connection between Africa and Europe, with African economies integrating into the capitalist world-economy driven by European demand for raw materials. However, the textbook focuses more on economic aspects, with less emphasis on cultural exchanges. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide any direct information related to the trans-Saharan trade routes or their historical role in linking Africa to Europe and Asia. Instead, the content centers on local events, such as a speech by Mr. Rainy, a death announcement, and an advertisement for a children's product, with no mention of trade routes, cultural exchanges, or economic interactions between continents. This absence of information highlights a lack of coverage on broader historical and economic contexts in the publication, suggesting a focus on local and domestic matters rather than international trade and cultural exchanges.

# Colonial powers in Africa exploited the continent's resources, leading to long-term economic challenges and social disruptions.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that colonial powers in Africa exploited the continent's resources, leading to long-term economic challenges and social disruptions. The textbook provides substantial support for the claim, detailing how colonial infrastructure was primarily designed for resource extraction rather than promoting overall economic development or inter-African connectivity. It highlights the neglect of industrialization, the focus on monocrop economies, and the detrimental effects of forced labor and land appropriation, all contributing to economic disparities and hindering nation-building. Additionally, colonial economic policies, such as tying African currencies to those of colonial powers and repatriating savings, further impeded African development. Socially, the textbook describes the humiliation and discrimination faced by Africans, the deterioration of women's status, and the creation of a sense of inferiority, all contributing to social disruptions. In contrast, the excerpts from The African Times news articles do not contain specific information related to the claim, appearing to be introductory or formal closing remarks without substantive content or context for analyzing colonial exploitation or its impacts. This absence of relevant information is noteworthy, as it suggests that the articles either do not cover this topic or that the relevant sections were not included in the excerpts, highlighting a gap in the discussion of historical and economic themes associated with colonial exploitation in Africa.

# The spread of Islam in Africa was facilitated by increased travel and trade by Muslim traders and proselytizers, paralleling European exploration and missionary activities.

The spread of Islam in Africa was significantly facilitated by increased travel and trade by Muslim traders and proselytizers, paralleling European exploration and missionary activities, as observed in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights that Islam spread into the African hinterland through long-distance trade, with coastal material culture, such as the Swahili kanzu, reaching inland areas like Buganda. It notes the penetration of Islam into rural areas and chiefly families, exemplified by Arab traders like Ahmed bin Ibrahim arriving in Buganda in 1844. The spread of Islam in East Africa was more trade-focused, while in West Africa, it was often militant, leading to the formation of theocratic states. Islam's ability to integrate with traditional African social and religious institutions allowed it to prosper under colonial rule, unlike Christianity, which was perceived as foreign. Trade routes and the influence of Muslim scholars and pilgrims returning from Mecca further facilitated Islam's spread. The African Times articles complement these observations by highlighting the role of Arab missionaries who traveled without financial support, spreading Islam by teaching the Koran and forming schools and congregations, akin to European missionary efforts subsidized by England and America. The articles emphasize the extensive travel of Muslims across Africa, creating a network that supported Islam's spread, particularly in Western Africa, through peaceful means. A notable difference is the self-reliance of Muslim missionaries compared to the European missionaries' reliance on external funding, underscoring a divergence in their methods of religious propagation. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that aligns with the claim, emphasizing both the similarities and differences in the spread of Islam and Christianity in Africa.

# Pre-colonial Africa had complex societies and civilizations with rich cultural, economic, and political systems, challenging the narrative that Africa was "uncivilized" before European colonization.

The "General History of Africa" textbook provides compelling evidence supporting the claim that pre-colonial Africa was home to complex societies and civilizations with rich cultural, economic, and political systems. It highlights the emergence of new centers of power and administrative reforms, indicating sophisticated political structures, and discusses the diversity and dynamism of African agricultural systems, challenging the notion of static, subsistence economies. The text emphasizes the centrality of agriculture to African economies and social structures, illustrating the complexity of these societies. Additionally, it describes the integration of African cultural elements into broader societies, such as in the Americas, showcasing the richness and resilience of African culture. These observations collectively refute the narrative that Africa was "uncivilized" before European colonization, demonstrating a history of complex and evolving societies. In contrast, the excerpt from The African Times news articles does not contain specific information related to this claim. The details provided, such as the location (Philadelphia, U.S.A.) and date (May 11th, 1876), do not pertain to African history or its pre-colonial societies. This absence of relevant content highlights a gap in the discussion, suggesting the need for additional sources to explore the complexities of African civilizations prior to European colonization.

# The struggle for independence in the 20th century was a pivotal moment in African history, leading to the formation of new nation-states and the reclamation of sovereignty from colonial powers.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the struggle for independence in the 20th century was a pivotal moment in African history, leading to the formation of new nation-states and the reclamation of sovereignty from colonial powers. The textbook provides substantial support for this claim by highlighting the significant contributions of African countries in Southern and Central Africa to the liberation movement, emphasizing anti-colonial protests and nationalist organizations. It discusses key events such as the Declaration of Independence in Egypt in 1922 and the eventual dismantling of colonial rule by the 1960s, resulting in the emergence of new nation-states. The text also acknowledges the complexities and challenges faced during this period, such as the settler factor and internal divisions, which influenced African nationalism. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide direct information related to the struggle for independence or the formation of new nation-states. Instead, they cover a range of unrelated topics, such as legal cases, religious reflections, health advice, and international diplomatic exchanges. This absence of relevant content highlights a significant difference in focus, as the articles do not address the pivotal historical events of African decolonization and sovereignty reclamation, underscoring a gap in coverage compared to the comprehensive historical narrative provided by the textbook.

# European colonization significantly altered Africa's political, social, and economic structures, leading to exploitation and disruption of traditional societies.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that European colonization significantly altered Africa's political, social, and economic structures, leading to exploitation and disruption of traditional societies. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, highlighting the profound impact of colonialism on Africa's economy through the shift to a money economy and integration into the capitalist world economy in a disadvantageous manner. It emphasizes the political weakening of indigenous systems, with traditional rulers being manipulated or deposed, and the social consequences, such as the widening gap between urban and rural areas, the introduction of racial discrimination, and the deterioration of women's status. The cultural imposition of European values and the undermining of African cultural practices are also noted, illustrating the detrimental changes brought about by colonization. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not contain direct references to the impact of European colonization on Africa. Instead, they focus on events and developments in Europe, such as political changes, cultural events, and scientific advancements, with no mention of African colonization or its effects. This absence of relevant content highlights a gap in the coverage of African issues in the African Times, underscoring a potential area of interest for historians examining the representation of African topics in historical media.

# African resistance to colonial rule was widespread and took various forms, from armed rebellion to diplomatic negotiation.

The General History of Africa textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim that African resistance to colonial rule was widespread and took various forms, including armed rebellion and diplomatic negotiation. It describes how African responses to colonialism included military confrontation, as seen with the Nandi in Kenya, and diplomatic efforts, although these were often in vain. The text also highlights non-violent forms of resistance, such as mass migration, strikes, boycotts, and the use of petitions and delegations, while discussing the ideological basis of resistance, emphasizing the loss of sovereignty and the struggle for a favorable modus vivendi under colonial rule. Additionally, it notes the economic resistance against European economic manipulation and the scramble for African labor, refuting the notion that African societies were naturally warlike or peaceful, instead showing that resistance was a regular phenomenon across different societies, whether centralized or stateless. In contrast, The African Times news article does not provide any information related to the claim of African resistance to colonial rule. Instead, it focuses on the technical details of manufacturing nitro-glycerine and related explosives, such as giant and Hercules powder, and the precautions necessary in their production, without mentioning African resistance, colonial rule, or any forms of rebellion or negotiation. This lack of relevant information highlights the article's divergence from the historical context of African resistance to colonialism, which would be of interest to historians studying the period.

# Arab and European invasions significantly altered the social, political, and economic structures of African societies.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that Arab and European invasions significantly altered the social, political, and economic structures of African societies. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, highlighting the profound impact of European and Arab contact on East African societies, particularly in coastal areas with longer exposure to these influences. It details the loss of sovereignty and transformation of political structures due to colonial rule, the rise of a warrior and merchant class, and the social effects of foreign rule, such as the emergence of an educated elite and the cultural devastation caused by the slave trade and colonialism. These insights underscore the significant alterations in African societies' social, political, and economic structures. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not directly address this historical claim, focusing instead on contemporary legal discussions, European political tensions, and corporate proceedings. This absence of relevant historical coverage highlights a notable difference, suggesting that the African Times, at least in these excerpts, prioritizes current events over historical narratives of invasions and their consequences on Africa. An expert historian might find this lack of coverage interesting, as it reflects a divergence in focus between historical analysis and contemporary reporting.

# European colonization had a profound impact on Africa, leading to significant political, social, and economic changes.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that European colonization had a profound impact on Africa, leading to significant political, social, and economic changes. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, highlighting how colonization integrated African economies into the global capitalist system through the introduction of a money economy, cash crops, and banking activities, albeit in an exploitative manner. Politically, it established a degree of peace and stability after initial violence, facilitating modernization. Socially, it accelerated urbanization, created new elite classes, and widened the gap between urban and rural areas, while also negatively impacting women's status and fostering a sense of inferiority among Africans. Culturally, European values were imposed, often dismissing African traditions and contributing to cultural inferiority. In contrast, The African Times articles do not directly address the impact of colonization on Africa, focusing instead on unrelated topics such as European business, legal, industrial, and cultural activities. This absence of relevant content highlights a lack of direct engagement with African issues, despite the newspaper's title, suggesting a focus on European interests that might indirectly relate to the broader context of European influence during the colonial period. However, it does not provide specific insights into the political, social, or economic changes in Africa due to colonization.

# The transatlantic slave trade and European colonization had profound impacts on African societies, leading to exploitation and conflict.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the transatlantic slave trade and European colonization had profound impacts on African societies, leading to exploitation and conflict. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim, detailing how the slave trade disrupted social and political structures, leading to internal conflicts among African groups like the Chikunda bands and Yao chiefs. It highlights the vulnerability of indigenous trading communities due to dependence on European arms and intermediaries, and how the abolition of the slave trade forced African elites to seek new commodities, perpetuating economic dependency. Furthermore, colonialism introduced forced labor, land appropriation, and racial discrimination, resulting in widespread poverty, social unrest, and a deep sense of inferiority among Africans. The cultural devastation caused by colonialism, as European settlers and missionaries undermined African cultural practices, is also noted. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not directly address the claim, focusing instead on unrelated topics such as the canonization process in Rome and economic challenges faced by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in 1872. This absence of direct reference to African societies and their historical experiences with colonization and the slave trade highlights a gap in the content of these articles concerning the claim.

# The transatlantic slave trade had a devastating impact on African communities, leading to widespread displacement and cultural disruption.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news article collectively provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the transatlantic slave trade had a devastating impact on African communities, leading to widespread displacement and cultural disruption. The textbook details how the slave trade dismantled social and political structures through kidnapping, raiding, and wars, destabilizing communities and disrupting the economic sphere by hindering agricultural activities and undermining local industries with imported goods. It highlights the depopulation of entire regions due to slave raids and resulting famines, exacerbating the population drain, and notes the intensification of internecine warfare, which led to cultural devastation and derailed traditional cultural directions. The mass migration of Africans to the Americas is described as a major historical event, leaving residual communities and affecting cultural transmission. Complementing this, The African Times article provides a personal account through the story of Mrs. Rose Nelson, who was taken from the Soombiah country near Sierra Leone at fifteen and spent seventy-five years in America. Her memories of her homeland, including cultural practices and local produce, underscore the cultural disruption and personal losses experienced by those forcibly removed. Despite her long absence, Mrs. Nelson retained memories of her native language and customs, highlighting the enduring impact of her displacement. Together, these sources illustrate the profound social, economic, and cultural impacts of the slave trade on African societies, emphasizing the widespread displacement and cultural disruption it caused.

# External influences such as the Arab and European slave trades and colonialism have profoundly shaped Africa's history.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that external influences, such as the Arab and European slave trades and colonialism, have profoundly shaped Africa's history. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, highlighting the cultural, economic, and social disruptions caused by the slave trade, which intensified internecine warfare and led to cultural devastation. It discusses the colonial imposition that integrated African economies into the global economic order in a disadvantageous and exploitative manner, resulting in monocrop economies and economic dependency. The cultural imposition of colonialism is noted, with European powers dismissing African cultural practices and imposing their own, fostering a sense of inferiority among Africans. Additionally, the text mentions the demographic and social impacts of the slave trade, including plantation slavery and the significant presence of slave populations, as well as the European and Asiatic settler problem, where settlers occupied fertile lands and dominated trade, exacerbating economic and social tensions. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not directly address the claim, focusing instead on British legal and political matters, such as historical practices in English criminal courts and a debate in the British House of Commons concerning military preparedness. This absence of information related to Africa's historical influences underscores the articles' focus on British internal affairs rather than the broader historical context of Africa's interactions with external powers, highlighting a significant difference in the scope and focus of the two sources.

# Fluctuations in the prices and demand for African goods like palm oil and palm kernels suggest a volatile market influenced by supply and demand dynamics and possibly external factors.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of a volatile market for African goods like palm oil and palm kernels, influenced by supply and demand dynamics and possibly external factors. The textbook highlights the transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, such as palm oil, in regions like Dahomey, driven by changing external demands. It notes the increase in palm oil imports into Britain and France, indicating a growing demand that influenced production. The reliance on monoculture economies, focusing on single cash crops like palm oil, made these economies highly vulnerable to market fluctuations, as seen during the Great Depression. The text also discusses the impact of colonial price controls and the dominance of large trading companies like the United Africa Company, which could manipulate market conditions. Additionally, external religious and cultural factors accelerated economic changes, underscoring the role of external influences in shaping market dynamics. In contrast, The African Times articles consistently report fluctuations in prices and demand for palm oil and palm kernels, with terms like "better supplies," "limited supplies," "good demand," and "market dull" indicating shifts in market conditions. These articles emphasize a market sensitive to internal supply and demand dynamics but do not explicitly mention external factors, which is a notable difference from the textbook's observations. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of a volatile market driven by both internal and external factors.

# The pricing and demand for African commodities like palm oil and palm kernels indicate their importance in the European industrial economy and reflect the economic value and strategic importance of these resources in the global market.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant economic value and strategic importance of African commodities like palm oil and palm kernels in the European industrial economy and the global market. The textbook highlights a dramatic increase in palm oil exports from Africa to Europe, particularly to Britain and France, during the 19th century, with imports into Britain rising from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21,000 tonnes in 1844. This surge reflects the growing demand and strategic importance of these resources, as regions like the Niger delta and the Gold Coast shifted from the slave trade to palm oil as a leading export product. The text also notes the "extraordinary demands on production" for palm oil, timber, and rubber, indicating their significance in the European industrial economy, while also pointing out the increased manpower required for their production compared to the slave trade. Complementing this, The African Times articles consistently report on the demand and pricing of palm oil and palm kernels, with specific sales volumes and price fluctuations, such as 800 tons sold at varying prices, highlighting their continued good demand and price advancements. Although the articles do not explicitly discuss the broader economic or strategic implications, their detailed reporting on pricing and sales underscores the relevance of these commodities in the global market. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the economic value and strategic importance of African commodities like palm oil in the European industrial economy.

# The variety of African goods listed in market reports suggests a diverse range of natural resources being exported from Africa.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles together provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the variety of African goods listed in market reports suggests a diverse range of natural resources being exported from Africa. The General History of Africa highlights a variety of cash crops such as cocoa, palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, coffee, and cloves, alongside minerals like gold and copper, indicating a range of natural resources being exported. However, it also points out the economic tendency towards monocultures, with countries often relying heavily on one or two primary exports, such as cocoa in the Gold Coast or groundnuts in Senegal, which contradicts the notion of a broadly diverse range of exports. Additionally, the historical context of the trans-Saharan trade and the shift from the slave trade to other commodities suggests a transformation in the types of goods exported over time. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide evidence supporting the claim by listing various African goods such as coffee, camwood, palm kernels, adansonia fiber, palm oil, cotton, ginger, and India-rubber, representing a wide array of natural resources. While these reports highlight the diversity of exports, they lack specific details about the origins or extent of these exports. Despite this, the presence of these goods in market reports aligns with the claim of diversity. Together, these sources suggest that while there is evidence of a variety of natural resources being exported from Africa, the economic focus on monocultures and historical shifts in trade present a more complex picture than the claim implies.

# Liberia's financial struggles, including its inability to pay salaries and reliance on loans, highlight the challenges of building a stable state without a strong economic foundation.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of Liberia's financial struggles and the challenges of building a stable state without a strong economic foundation. The General History of Africa details Liberia's economic difficulties between 1915 and 1935, highlighting the decline in trade and agriculture, which were the country's leading sectors. This decline severely curtailed government revenue, primarily derived from customs duties, leading to mounting debts. The Liberian government frequently borrowed from foreign financiers and local merchants under harsh terms, further straining its finances. The inability to pay government employees' salaries in full or on time is noted, along with the corrupt practices that arose from this financial instability. Additionally, the text describes how Liberia's economic weakness allowed for increased foreign control over its financial administration and hindered its ability to develop infrastructure and human resources. Similarly, The African Times article underscores these financial struggles by highlighting Liberia's gross revenue of about £10,000 a year and its inability to pay the salaries of its home officers. It criticizes the reliance on loans, noting that the annual interest on the loan is almost equal to the gross revenue, further emphasizing the economic challenges faced by Liberia. The article also points out the lack of capitalists within Liberia and the country's failure to attract foreign capital, underscoring the difficulties in establishing a stable economic base. Additionally, it criticizes the use of titles and grand events like the "Liberian Annual Ball," suggesting that such practices make Liberia appear ridiculous rather than addressing its economic issues. Together, these observations illustrate the significant challenges Liberia faced in establishing a stable state due to its fragile economic foundation.

# The establishment of cotton production in Africa faced logistical challenges, such as the lack of appropriate machinery and transportation issues.

The establishment of cotton production in Africa faced significant logistical challenges, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa emphasizes the infrastructural developments, such as the construction of railways, roads, and irrigation systems, which were crucial for facilitating the export of cash crops like cotton. This suggests that prior to these developments, transportation was a major logistical hurdle. The text also underscores the importance of water management projects, like the Aswan dam, indicating that irrigation was a critical logistical issue for cotton cultivation. However, it does not explicitly address the lack of appropriate machinery, focusing more on transportation and infrastructure. In contrast, The African Times articles provide direct evidence of machinery-related challenges, noting the absence of a cotton press at the Onitsha Industrial Institution due to transportation limitations and highlighting the shortage of necessary machinery, such as a good perpendicular press and multiple Garnett cotton gins. The articles describe the difficulties in managing large bales of cotton without a press and the reliance on native laborers to operate the gin, indicating a lack of mechanized support. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted logistical challenges, including both transportation and machinery issues, that hindered the development of cotton production in Africa.

# Local African leaders and traders were willing to shift from traditional trades, such as slaves and ivory, to cotton cultivation if a reliable market was established.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that local African leaders and traders were willing to shift from traditional trades, such as slaves and ivory, to cotton cultivation if a reliable market was established. The General History of Africa highlights the transition from the slave trade to the production of natural products like palm oil, groundnuts, and rubber, driven by the abolition of the slave trade and European market demand. This shift underscores the adaptive capacity of indigenous societies in embracing new forms of trade, yet the text does not specifically mention cotton cultivation or the establishment of a reliable market for it as part of this transition. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing instances where local leaders, such as King Ama Abokko and influential traders, expressed willingness to focus on cotton cultivation, contingent upon market opportunities. The distribution of cotton seeds to farmers and positive responses from native growers in Senegal further indicate a shift towards cotton agriculture. However, the articles do not explicitly mention a transition from slave and ivory trading to cotton, highlighting a difference from the claim. Together, these sources suggest a broader economic integration into the capitalist world-economy, with evidence of potential shifts towards cotton cultivation driven by market incentives, but they do not directly link this shift to a departure from traditional trades like slavery and ivory.

# The strategic importance of cotton cultivation in the colonial economy was highlighted by the involvement of officials and religious figures.

The strategic importance of cotton cultivation in the colonial economy is underscored by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, though they highlight different aspects of involvement. The General History of Africa textbook details the significant role of colonial officials in promoting cotton cultivation, such as the Egyptian administration's efforts to boost revenues and repay debts, and the British administration's fiscal reforms to capitalize on cotton export surpluses. It also notes the compulsory cultivation of cotton in French West Africa and the active promotion of cash crops by colonial administrations across various African regions. However, the textbook does not mention the involvement of religious figures, suggesting that their role in cotton cultivation is not supported by this source. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence of both official and religious involvement, highlighting the support of colonial officials like the Governor who aided M. Drouet's cotton initiative with a gunboat on the River Senegal. Furthermore, the articles emphasize the participation of religious figures, such as the Bishop of Senegambia, who established a cotton plantation near Goree. The grant of 2,500 acres by the Minister of Marine and the Colonies for cotton cultivation in the valley of Signofil further illustrates the strategic importance placed on this endeavor. Together, these sources reveal a comprehensive picture of the roles played by colonial officials and, as per The African Times, religious figures in advancing cotton cultivation as a key component of the colonial economy.

# The west side of Africa presents a strategic location for cotton production, potentially benefiting both African economies and European industries.

The claim that the west side of Africa presents a strategic location for cotton production, potentially benefiting both African economies and European industries, is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly by the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook does not specifically highlight the west side of Africa as a strategic location for cotton production. Instead, it focuses on the monocrop economies established during colonial times, such as cocoa in the Gold Coast and groundnuts in Senegal and The Gambia, and emphasizes the exploitative nature of colonial economic integration and the lack of diversification in agricultural production. It also discusses the import of European cotton goods into Africa, suggesting a reliance on European textiles rather than local cotton production for export. In contrast, The African Times articles provide several details supporting the claim, noting the high quality of indigenous cotton in Africa, comparable to that of New Orleans, and the extensive cultivation over many hundred miles, indicating significant production capacity. The articles highlight economic benefits, such as the profitable sale of 450 lbs. of cotton in Manchester, and emphasize the presence of a numerous and industrious population accustomed to agriculture, which could support a robust cotton industry. The strategic location is further supported by the navigability of large rivers like the Niger, facilitating transportation and trade. However, the articles also note the need for organized investment and infrastructure, such as cotton gins and trading stations, to fully realize this potential. Together, these observations illustrate both the opportunities and challenges in establishing a successful cotton trade that could benefit both African and European economies.

# The Anglo-German agreements and conventions were pivotal in solidifying British influence and delineating spheres of influence in East Africa.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the Anglo-German agreements and conventions were pivotal in solidifying British influence and delineating spheres of influence in East Africa. The textbook highlights the significance of the Anglo-German delimitation treaty of 1886, which placed Zanzibar and most of its dependencies within Britain's sphere of influence while recognizing Germany's political influence in East Africa. This treaty marked the beginning of formalized spheres of influence by effectively partitioning the Omani empire. The subsequent Heligoland Treaty of 1890 further partitioned East Africa, reserving Uganda for Britain and ending Zanzibar's independence, exemplifying how European powers used agreements to establish and solidify their influence. The textbook also notes that acquiring a sphere of influence by treaty was often the first stage in the occupation of an African state by a European power, although these arrangements were sometimes vague and contested, leading to further negotiations. Complementing this, The African Times articles emphasize that the Anglo-German convention removed obstacles for the Imperial British East Africa Company, extending British influence from Wanga to Kismayu and across the Victoria Nyanza into the Congo State, including Uganda and Unyoro. The convention established the Juba River as the northern frontier, clearly delineating spheres of influence. The British East Africa Company played a crucial role in maintaining and protecting British rights, essential for national interests in the region. Together, these sources underscore the pivotal role of the Anglo-German agreements in shaping British influence in East Africa, with no details refuting the claim, while also highlighting the complexity and ongoing nature of these diplomatic efforts.

# The establishment of the Imperial British East Africa Company was a strategic move to counter German influence and protect British interests in East Africa.

The establishment of the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) was a strategic move to counter German influence and protect British interests in East Africa, as supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the Anglo-German delimitation treaty of 1886, which recognized Germany's political influence in East Africa and partitioned the Omani empire, suggesting a breach of Britain's monopoly in the area. This indicates that Britain was motivated to establish the IBEAC to maintain its influence and counter German expansion. The text also describes Britain's initial attempts to protect its interests by strengthening local authorities, such as Seyyid Barghash, without direct colonization, eventually resorting to more direct control through the IBEAC. The British occupation of Egypt in 1882 for strategic reasons, including the protection of interests in East Africa, further supports this view. Similarly, The African Times articles mention the Anglo-German convention, which removed obstacles for the British company and safeguarded British influence along the East Coast of Africa. The concession granted to Sir William Mackinnon by Sultan Burghash was a response to German protectorates and the influx of adventurers, indicating a strategic effort to maintain British influence. The articles also highlight the extension of British influence from Wanga to Kismayu and into the Congo State, including Uganda and Unyoro, as a result of the Anglo-German Agreement. Both sources emphasize the IBEAC's role in maintaining and protecting national interests in East Africa, suggesting its importance in countering German influence. However, neither source explicitly states that the company's establishment was solely to counter German influence, but rather as part of a broader strategy to secure British interests, including the acquisition of the protectorate of Zanzibar and the British sphere. This nuanced perspective aligns with the claim while highlighting the complexity of the geopolitical motivations involved.

# The competition among European powers in Africa during this period was intense, with each nation seeking to establish control over unclaimed territories through exploration and treaties.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial support for the claim that the competition among European powers in Africa during this period was intense, with each nation seeking to establish control over unclaimed territories through exploration and treaties. The textbook highlights the rivalry between European nations, particularly Britain, Germany, France, and Portugal, as they expanded their influence in Africa, with the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 serving as a pivotal event where European powers formalized the partition of Africa through treaties with African rulers or bilateral agreements. It emphasizes the role of explorers, missionaries, and traders in paving the way for colonial expansion and the strategic use of treaties to establish spheres of influence, alongside the use of military superiority and arms regulation to maintain control. Similarly, The African Times articles detail the significant expansion of European territorial claims from 1876 to 1890, with Great Britain, France, Germany, and others dramatically increasing their holdings. The articles provide specific examples, such as French explorers M. Cholet and M. Crampel securing French influence, and German efforts led by Lieutenant Morgen and Dr. Zintgraff to establish bases deeper in the continent. They also highlight the strategic maneuvers of the Royal Niger Company to maintain British influence in the Central Soudan and mention treaties like the Anglo-German Agreement, underscoring the diplomatic efforts to delineate spheres of influence. Together, these sources illustrate the fervent scramble for Africa among European powers, marked by intense competition and strategic maneuvers to dominate African territories.

# The movement and establishment of regular mail steamers like the Macgregor Laird and Mandingo highlight the interconnectedness and importance of communication and trade between Africa and Europe during the colonial period.

The claim regarding the movement and establishment of regular mail steamers like the Macgregor Laird and Mandingo highlights the interconnectedness and importance of communication and trade between Africa and Europe during the colonial period. While the General History of Africa textbook does not specifically mention these steamers, it provides a broader context of trade and communication between Africa and Europe, emphasizing the transformation of Africa's economic relations with Europe from the mid-18th century onwards. The text discusses the role of European commercial firms in connecting Africa with Western markets and the expansion of European trade, facilitated by pre-existing local and regional trade networks. It also notes the establishment of regular cargo and passenger lines between Brazil and the west coast of Africa, indicating a level of interconnectedness and communication. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide specific details supporting the claim, highlighting the regularity and schedule of steamers like the Macgregor Laird and Mandingo, with specific dates of arrivals and departures, such as the Macgregor Laird arriving in Liverpool with mails from the West Coast of Africa and the Mandingo arriving with the monthly mail. This regularity underscores the structured nature of communication and trade routes established during this period. The articles mention various ports of call along the West Coast of Africa, such as Benin, Lagos, and Sierra Leone, illustrating an extensive network of trade and communication. They also note the presence of other steamships, such as the Biafra and Congo, part of the Royal Mail Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, indicating a broader system of maritime connections. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the broader socio-economic impacts of these steamers, which could be an area of interest for historians studying the colonial period. Together, these observations from both sources provide a comprehensive view of the operational aspects of mail steamers and their role in facilitating communication and trade between Africa and Europe.

# The presence of multiple steamship companies and structured shipping services along the West African coast suggests a significant level of trade and communication between Africa and Europe during this period.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of significant trade and communication between Africa and Europe during the period in question, facilitated by structured shipping services. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines, such as the British African Company and the African Steam-Ship Company, which replaced slave ships and operated between ports like Bahía de Todos os Santos and Lagos. This indicates a structured and regular shipping service along the West African coast, with a considerable volume of trade involving exports and imports like cigars, tobacco, rum, local fabrics, cola nuts, and palm oil. The presence of steamships, such as the steamer Biaffra, further suggests significant trade and communication, although the text emphasizes trade routes and interactions within Africa and with regions like Brazil, rather than explicitly focusing on Europe. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically highlight the connection between Africa and Europe, noting the presence of multiple steamship companies, such as the Royal Mail Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, which indicate a structured and competitive shipping service. The establishment of a bi-monthly line of steamers from Liverpool, along with mail packets, underscores the organized nature of these maritime operations, with specific ports of call and scheduled arrivals and departures forming a well-coordinated network. The mention of consistent rates of freight and passage across the company's steamers suggests a standardized commercial framework, collectively supporting the claim of robust trade and communication links between Africa and Europe during this period.

# The construction and expansion of railways were seen as strategic moves to facilitate economic growth and resource extraction in Africa.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that the construction and expansion of railways in Africa were strategic moves to facilitate economic growth and resource extraction. The textbook highlights that railways were primarily built to connect mineral deposits and cash crop production areas to export ports in countries like Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Uganda, Nigeria, and South Africa. This infrastructure was designed to integrate African economies into the global market, focusing on exporting raw materials to European countries. The colonial railways, often constructed by foreign companies, were not intended to promote inter-African travel or overall economic development within the continent but served the colonial powers' interests by linking production areas to the world commodity market. In regions like Southern Rhodesia and South Africa, railways were more sophisticated, serving mining areas and settler farms, further emphasizing their role in resource extraction. The text also notes that colonial administrations systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from these resources, reinforcing the idea that railways were tools for economic exploitation rather than development. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight a movement in Manchester aimed at opening up Central Africa to trade, particularly in the cotton industry, by constructing a railway from the East of Africa to Victoria Nyanza Lake. This initiative is portrayed as a means to exploit Africa's natural wealth and vast population for commerce, indicating a strategic economic motive. The articles also discuss the potential national advantages of opening up a gold-producing region in Wassaw through railway construction and detail a memorial from Gold Mining Companies on the Gold Coast urging the government to build a railway to facilitate mining operations. These examples underscore the association between railway expansion and resource extraction. Overall, both sources align with the claim by illustrating how railways were integral to the colonial economic strategy of resource extraction and export facilitation, perceived as crucial for economic growth and resource exploitation in Africa.

# The allocation of funds for education was significantly lower than other services, suggesting a lower priority given to educational development during the colonial period in Africa.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the allocation of funds for education was significantly lower than other services during the colonial period in Africa, indicating a lower priority for educational development. The General History of Africa highlights that government expenditure on education was minimal, with only 4% of total revenue allocated in Nigeria and the French territories, and 7% in Ghana during the mid-1930s, suggesting that education was not a primary focus for colonial administrations. It also notes the inadequate and uneven distribution of educational facilities, with most post-primary institutions concentrated in urban centers, and criticizes the curriculum for being irrelevant to African needs, as it was modeled on European systems. Furthermore, the text mentions that colonial powers aimed to produce Africans who would be more productive for the colonial system rather than promoting education for its own sake. Similarly, The African Times provides detailed financial allocations for Her Majesty's Settlements on the Gambia for 1869, where the allocation for education was £300, significantly lower than other services such as salaries for fixed establishments (£9,603 14 6), pensions (£2,156), and works and buildings (£3,655). The actual expenditure on education was even lower at £210 16 1, indicating that not all allocated funds were utilized, further emphasizing the lower priority given to educational development. However, the articles lack qualitative context or rationale for these allocations, which is a notable difference from the broader historical analysis provided by the textbook. Together, these observations underscore the lower priority given to education compared to other services during the colonial era.

# The ongoing challenges in eradicating the slave trade and the role of colonial powers in addressing or perpetuating it.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the complex challenges in eradicating the slave trade and the dual role of colonial powers in both addressing and perpetuating it. The textbook highlights the economic dependence on slave labor in plantation economies like Zanzibar and Pemba, and the difficulties faced by both the Sultan of Zanzibar and the British in effectively enforcing decrees against the trade. It discusses the limited impact of treaties and naval patrols, and the persistence of the trade due to internal strife and the ingenuity of traders in evading capture. The British efforts to abolish the trade through naval patrols, treaties, and the establishment of Courts of Equity, which eroded local rulers' power, are noted, though these efforts were often undermined by economic interests and the complicity of local and foreign traders. Meanwhile, The African Times articles highlight ongoing issues, such as a suspected slaver flying Spanish colors being intercepted by Her Majesty's steamship Ariel, indicating efforts by colonial powers to address the trade. The articles also discuss the devastation caused by civil war and the need for improved communication infrastructure, suggesting recognition by colonial powers of the necessity to address these challenges. However, the articles also reflect a colonial agenda, as seen in Captain Lugard's actions to secure treaties and commercial rights, which could perpetuate colonial control rather than solely focusing on eradicating the slave trade. The absence of explicit mention of direct efforts to end the slave trade in some articles suggests a focus on economic and territorial interests. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that supports and complicates the claim, illustrating the interplay of economic, political, and social factors that made the eradication of the slave trade challenging, and the role of colonial powers in both addressing and perpetuating it.

# The expansion of transportation networks, like railways, was crucial for connecting resource-rich interior regions with coastal areas, facilitating trade and economic growth.

The expansion of transportation networks, particularly railways, played a crucial role in connecting resource-rich interior regions with coastal areas, thereby facilitating trade and economic growth, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the significant impact of railways in countries like Uganda and Nigeria, where they reduced transport costs and spurred industrial growth, such as in the groundnut industry. In South Africa, the discovery of gold and diamonds necessitated railway construction to link mining areas to ports, facilitating exports. Similarly, railways in Northern Rhodesia and Sierra Leone were built to connect mineral deposits to export ports. However, the textbook also notes that the benefits were not uniformly positive across the continent, as railways often served colonial interests, focusing on transporting cash crops and minerals from the interior to the coast, rather than promoting general economic welfare. The African Times articles complement this view by highlighting specific infrastructure projects, such as a bridge in Natal that eased the transport of goods like sugar and cotton, and plans for a railway from Lake Victoria Nyanza to the coast. These projects are portrayed as catalysts for economic progress, emphasizing the logistical and engineering efforts to overcome geographical challenges. While the articles focus on immediate logistical benefits, they align with the claim by illustrating the essential role of transportation infrastructure in unlocking the economic potential of interior regions and integrating them into broader trade networks.

# The development of light railways and other public works was considered crucial for the improvement and development of African colonies.

The development of light railways and other public works in African colonies is a topic that elicits both support and critique, as observed in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the dual role of infrastructure development, noting its significant impact on facilitating economic activities, reducing transport costs, and promoting urbanization in colonies like Uganda, Nigeria, and South Africa. These projects were crucial for economic growth, such as connecting mining areas and expanding industries like groundnut farming. However, the textbook also emphasizes that these public works primarily served the colonial powers' interests by enabling resource extraction and linking them to the world market, often neglecting the general welfare of the colonies or inter-African connectivity. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing a resolution moved by Mr. Charles Ingrey, which underscores the importance of light railways and public works for colonial development, as it was seriously considered by the Imperial Government. The resolution's seconding by Mr. Rowbotham and subsequent agreement further highlight the perceived significance of these initiatives. However, the articles lack specific details about the African colonies or the broader context of colonial development, which could be of interest to historians. Together, these sources present a nuanced view that both aligns with and challenges the claim, illustrating the complex motivations and impacts of infrastructure development in colonial Africa.

# The establishment of mail services and transportation networks in West Africa highlights the strategic importance of the region in global communication and trade.

The strategic importance of West Africa in global communication and trade is underscored by the establishment of transportation networks and mail services, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details the construction of infrastructure such as railways, roads, and telegraph lines by colonial administrations, primarily aimed at facilitating the evacuation of exports. This infrastructure was strategically designed to connect coastal areas with interior sources of cash crops and mineral deposits, highlighting the region's economic significance. Additionally, the role of shipping, dominated by British and German firms, further supports West Africa's strategic importance in global trade networks. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention the establishment of mail services, which is a notable divergence from the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the significance of mail services, detailing the challenges faced by the Royal Mail Steamship Company in maintaining regular mail service to the Cameroons and the establishment of a monthly mail service by French Packets between Dakar and Sierra Leone. These developments illustrate the integration of West Africa into broader global trade routes and underscore the region's strategic role in facilitating communication between Europe and other parts of the world. Collectively, these observations highlight West Africa's critical position in global communication and trade networks, aligning with the claim while offering complementary perspectives on transportation and mail services.

# The imposition of European economic practices and systems of accountability on African regions is evident in the requirement for prepaid postage and registration fees.

The claim regarding the imposition of European economic practices and systems of accountability on African regions, specifically through the requirement for prepaid postage and registration fees, is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not directly mention prepaid postage or registration fees, focusing instead on broader European economic impositions such as taxation, forced labor, and the integration of African economies into the European-dominated world economy. It highlights the use of taxes to drive Africans into wage labor, the establishment of financial administrations, and the exploitation of African resources by European commercial firms. This absence suggests that the specific detail of prepaid postage and registration fees is not covered in the textbook's historical context. In contrast, The African Times provides details supporting the claim, noting the Congo Free State's entry into the Postal Union, which imposed specific rates of postage and required prepaid fees for letters, post cards, newspapers, and other printed materials, as well as registration fees and delivery acknowledgment charges. These requirements reflect European economic practices, emphasizing structured postal systems and financial accountability, aligning with the claim of European economic influence in African regions. However, the articles do not delve into the broader implications of these practices on African societies, leaving an area of interest for historians studying the impact of European economic systems in Africa.

# The importation of spirits by European countries into West Africa was seen as a detrimental influence, hindering both trade and the progress of civilization.

The importation of spirits by European countries into West Africa was perceived as a detrimental influence, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the deleterious health effects of the widespread distribution of strong alcoholic drinks, often used as wages, and notes the economic significance of spirits, with a substantial portion of government revenue in the Niger Coast Protectorate derived from this trade. While the textbook underscores the health implications and economic reliance on spirits, it does not explicitly link their importation to hindrances in trade or civilization progress. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a more direct connection to the claim, with figures like Mr. Hutton and the Manchester Chamber of Commerce expressing concerns about the negative impact of low-cost spirits, particularly from Germany, on local populations. They argue that this trade demoralizes the natives and retards the development of civilization and commerce. The articles also highlight efforts by the National African Company to restrict such harmful trades and note England's relative isolation in attempting to limit spirit imports, indicating a broader European reluctance to address the issue. Together, these sources illustrate a shared concern about the negative consequences of spirit importation on West African societies and economies, with The African Times explicitly linking it to hindrances in trade and civilization progress.

---

# The regulation of arms and spirits trade in Africa was influenced by international agreements, reflecting the geopolitical interests of colonial powers.

The regulation of arms trade in Africa was significantly influenced by international agreements, reflecting the geopolitical interests of colonial powers, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the monopolization of arms and ammunition as a critical factor in the balance of power in Africa during the 1870s, with Europeans using the supply of quality guns as a bargaining tool for treaties and alliances. This necessitated the regulation of the arms trade through international agreements, such as the Berlin Conference and the subsequent Brussels Act, which banned the supply of arms to African rulers under the guise of an anti-slavery campaign. These actions were driven by the intense rivalry between colonial powers, particularly the British and the French. Similarly, The African Times articles discuss the Anti-Slavery Conference, which addressed firearms traffic and involved multiple European powers, including France, Great Britain, Holland, Germany, Portugal, and Italy. The debates over regulation, with France advocating for a complete prohibition and others opposing due to mercantile interests, further reflect the geopolitical interests at play. The Brussels Conference's provisions aimed at disarming Arab traders to protect African natives also indicate international efforts to regulate arms trade. However, both sources notably omit any mention of the regulation of the spirits trade, which is a divergence from the initial claim. Overall, both sources support the claim regarding arms trade regulation but do not address the spirits trade aspect.

# The introduction of self-treatment guides in the 19th century reflects a shift towards personal responsibility for health and a move away from reliance on traditional medical professionals.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the claim regarding the introduction of self-treatment guides in the 19th century and the associated shift towards personal responsibility for health. The textbook primarily focuses on the development of medical services in Africa through colonial governments, missionaries, and local initiatives, highlighting the establishment of hospitals and dispensaries despite limited resources. It mentions local self-help projects and medical auxiliaries but does not directly address self-treatment guides or a broader movement towards personal health responsibility, indicating a difference in focus from the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence supporting the claim, detailing advertisements for "The Pocket Medical Adviser," which promotes self-treatment for ailments without the need for traditional medical professionals. This guide is described as beneficial for those seeking "self-cure," with testimonials underscoring its effectiveness in independent health management, aligning with the claim of a trend towards personal health responsibility. However, the articles also cover a wide range of topics, including financial services, which diverges from the claim's exclusive focus on medical self-reliance. Overall, while the textbook does not support or refute the claim, The African Times articles provide evidence of a shift towards personal health management in the 19th century.

# The reference to the events of September 4th, 1865, suggests a history of colonial military intervention in Africa, where local populations were subjected to violence by colonial forces.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both highlight a history of colonial military intervention in Africa, where local populations were subjected to violence by colonial forces. The textbook provides numerous instances of such interventions, detailing military campaigns, punitive expeditions, and armed actions by European powers against African states and communities, such as the British campaigns in the Gold Coast against the Asante, the French campaigns in the Western Sudan, and the Italian campaign against Ethiopia. These examples illustrate a pattern of violent colonial intervention, although the textbook does not specifically mention the events of September 4th, 1865, indicating a gap between the claim and the textbook's content. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically reference the events of September 4th, 1865, describing a violent encounter where the local population was "slaughtered like sheep by the soldiers of the 4th West Indian Regiment," aligning with the claim of colonial military intervention. The articles also mention a record being forwarded to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, suggesting colonial authority involvement, but lack specific details about the location or broader context of these events. Additionally, the focus on the King's order to prevent the firing of arms during traditional ceremonies highlights local governance efforts to avoid violence, contrasting with previous colonial military actions. Together, these sources underscore the broader theme of colonial violence in Africa, while also pointing to specific instances and responses that shaped this historical narrative.

# The nomination aimed to better convey the Administrator's intentions to the King and his people.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the nomination aimed to better convey the Administrator's intentions to the King and his people. The General History of Africa does not directly address this claim, focusing instead on the colonial administration's strategies, such as indirect rule, manipulation of traditional chiefs, and integration of local authorities into the colonial system. It highlights the complexities of managing relationships between traditional and new African elites and colonial regimes, without providing evidence of nominations being used explicitly for communication purposes between administrators and local rulers. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim, stating that the nomination of a representative was intended to ensure that the Administrator's real wishes and intentions were more fully communicated to the King and his people. This was deemed necessary due to the limitations of previous short and formal interactions. The nomination of a native gentleman of ability, experience, and prudence, who was well received at Government House, underscores the intention to enhance communication and understanding between the Administrator and the King. The African Times provides details that align closely with the stated purpose of the nomination, without refuting the claim.

# The colonial justice system in Africa was often biased and could be manipulated by those in power to serve their interests.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the colonial justice system in Africa was often biased and manipulable by those in power to serve their interests. The General History of Africa highlights how the colonial system allowed subjects to appeal to colonial courts, thereby weakening traditional rulers' authority and indicating a bias towards colonial interests. The French system's indigénat, which permitted administrators to impose punishments for minor infractions, exemplifies the manipulation of justice to maintain control. Although European judicial institutions incorporated some African customary law, the modifications favored European legal concepts, further demonstrating bias. Additionally, the subordination of indigenous authorities in the French and Portuguese systems underscores the manipulation to serve colonial interests. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles provide concrete examples of bias and manipulation. In one case, Captain Hall, a stipendiary magistrate, displayed a conflict of interest by entering the court with the plaintiff and allowing him to sit on the bench, while aggressively responding to the defense and refusing to make amends, illustrating a misuse of judicial power. Another article describes a defendant's accusations against the Deputy Collector and Acting Administrator for attempting to unjustly stigmatize him, highlighting potential corruption and personal gain. These examples from both sources collectively demonstrate that the colonial justice system was indeed biased and susceptible to manipulation by those in power.

# The promotion and use of medical remedies like Lamplough's Pyretic Saline in colonial regions were part of broader efforts to manage health crises that affected colonial populations and military personnel.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced understanding of the claim regarding the promotion and use of medical remedies like Lamplough's Pyretic Saline in colonial regions. The "General History of Africa" offers a detailed account of the health challenges and medical interventions in colonial Africa, emphasizing the establishment of hospitals, sanitary measures, and the development of vaccines and treatments for diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, and sleeping sickness. It highlights the colonial focus on protecting European settlers and military personnel, aligning with the claim that health management efforts were directed towards colonial populations. However, the textbook does not specifically mention Lamplough's Pyretic Saline, suggesting that while such remedies may have been used, they were not central to the broader narrative of colonial health management. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim, mentioning a letter from Rawal Pindee, Punjab, that highlights the use of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline in fever-stricken districts and its perceived effectiveness compared to Quinine. This suggests a systematic approach to managing health crises, with interest in securing large supplies of the remedy. However, the articles lack broader context regarding health management strategies or the involvement of military personnel, beyond officers recommending the Saline. This absence of broader context contrasts with the textbook's emphasis on comprehensive public health measures, underscoring a gap in specific details about the use of particular medical remedies in the colonial context.

# The amalgamation of trading interests under the United African Company was essential for overcoming the challenges posed by intertribal warfare and European competition.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the claim that the amalgamation of trading interests under the United African Company was essential for overcoming challenges posed by intertribal warfare and European competition. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced view of the dynamics between African traders and European powers, highlighting the decline of African and Arab trading classes due to colonial rule and European competition, which undermined African traders' autonomy and economic power. It discusses the strategic use of divide and rule by Europeans, exploiting African rivalries, but does not specifically mention the United African Company or its role in overcoming these challenges. This absence suggests that the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim directly, instead providing context on the broader economic and political challenges faced by African traders during the colonial period. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing how the amalgamation of trading interests under the United African Company was necessary to address intertribal warfare and European competition. The articles describe how the company became strong enough to repress native turbulence and exert influence to preserve order, indicating that the union was essential for overcoming intertribal challenges. They also highlight the national jealousies of competing European firms as obstacles that the amalgamation helped to overcome, aligning with the claim that it was crucial for successful commercial enterprise in the region. The formation and reorganization of the United African Company into the National African Company, with increased capital and expanded operations, further support the strategic importance of the amalgamation. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the complexities involved in the claim, with The African Times offering direct support and the General History of Africa providing broader contextual insights.

# The nomination of a director by the African Association highlights the influence and control European companies sought to exert over African business operations.

The examination of the claim regarding the nomination of a director by the African Association and its implications for European influence over African business operations reveals differing emphases in the sources. The "General History of Africa" textbook does not specifically mention the African Association or the nomination of a director, nor does it directly address European control through such nominations. Instead, it provides a broader context of European influence in Africa, highlighting how European powers used treaties, commercial activities, and missionary work to establish spheres of influence and exploit local resources. This suggests a pattern of European control, though it does not specifically address the claim about the African Association. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide concrete details supporting the claim, noting that the African Association, a European company, was entitled to nominate a board member for election to another company's Council until June 30, 1902, contingent upon Council approval. The articles emphasize the African Association's significant financial stake, with over £50,000 in shares, underscoring their influence and aligning with the claim of European control through strategic financial and governance maneuvers. However, these articles do not discuss the broader context of European influence, focusing instead on the specific case of the African Association. Together, these observations highlight both the specific mechanisms of control employed by European companies and the broader historical context of European influence in Africa.

# The training and deployment of African men by British officials highlight the influence of colonial powers in shaping local military practices and alliances.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant influence of British colonial powers in shaping local military practices and alliances in Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of the Sudan Defence Force, staffed by both Sudanese and British officers, as a direct example of British influence on local military structures. It also notes the use of compulsory recruitment in British East Africa and the Uganda Protectorate, as well as the employment of African troops for police functions and the creation of constabulary forces, all driven by colonial needs and strategies. The British tactic of "divide and conquer" and their manipulation of African rivalries further illustrate their role in shaping alliances, although the deployment of African soldiers in unfamiliar regions often alienated them from their own societies, potentially limiting the effectiveness of these alliances. Complementing this, The African Times articles detail the involvement of British officials like Captain Nicol and Captain Hopkins in recruiting and training African men for the Coomassie Expedition, highlighting the direct organization of native troops by colonial powers. The collaboration between local leaders, such as King George Pepple, and British officials in deploying these troops to Cape Coast or Accra further supports the claim of colonial influence. However, the articles do not delve into the broader implications of these actions on local military practices beyond the immediate context, suggesting an area for further historical exploration. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of how British colonial powers shaped military practices and alliances in Africa.

# The movement of colonial officials between different African territories indicates a centralized approach to governance by the British Empire.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim regarding the movement of colonial officials as an indicator of a centralized approach to governance by the British Empire. The General History of Africa emphasizes the British use of indirect rule, which relied on existing indigenous institutions and leaders to administer large territories, such as in Northern Nigeria under Lugard. This approach suggests a decentralized method of governance, focusing on local structures rather than a centralized movement of officials. The textbook also highlights regional distinctions in colonial administration, such as differences between British and French methods, further indicating a lack of a uniform centralized approach. While the British extended indirect rule to other territories like Tanganyika and Cameroon, the emphasis was on adapting to local customs rather than centralizing governance through the movement of officials. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide evidence supporting the claim of a centralized approach through the movement of colonial officials. The articles detail appointments and transfers of officials, such as W. Brandford Griffith's move from Lieutenant-Governor of the Gold Coast to Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, and Captain C. A. Moloney's transfer from the Gambia to Lagos. These movements suggest a centralized system where officials are reassigned across different colonies, indicating a coordinated approach to governance. The articles do not provide evidence of local or decentralized decision-making in these appointments, reinforcing the notion of a centralized British administrative structure managing its colonial territories in Africa. Together, these sources illustrate a complex picture of British colonial governance, with elements of both centralized and decentralized practices.

# The appointment of British officials to high-ranking positions in African colonies reflects the colonial practice of prioritizing British interests and control over local governance.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the appointment of British officials to high-ranking positions in African colonies reflects the colonial practice of prioritizing British interests and control over local governance. The General History of Africa highlights how British colonial officials often acted as de facto dictators rather than advisers to traditional rulers, enforcing unpopular measures like forced labor and taxes, which led to a loss of prestige for traditional rulers and underscored the prioritization of British control. The British employed indirect rule by using local chiefs as administrative agents, but these chiefs were often appointed or manipulated to serve colonial interests, further emphasizing British dominance. The textbook also notes that British colonial policy was influenced by economic and political determinants, with commercial firms exerting significant influence, illustrating how British interests were prioritized over local governance. Complementing this, The African Times articles detail specific appointments of British individuals, such as Mr. J. R. Holmes as a District Commissioner in the Gold Coast Colony and Mr. Gilbert T. Carter as the Colonial Secretary of the Gambia, to significant administrative roles, demonstrating the colonial strategy of maintaining British control and influence. The movement of British officials like Lieut.-Governor Griffiths and Sir Samuel Rowe between colonies and back to England further highlights the central role of British personnel in colonial governance. Notably, the absence of information on the involvement or representation of local African individuals in these high-ranking positions aligns with the claim of prioritizing British interests over local governance.

# The profitability of the Company of African Merchants indicates the economic opportunities and exploitation present in African trade during the colonial period.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced perspective on the claim regarding the profitability of the Company of African Merchants and the economic opportunities and exploitation present in African trade during the colonial period. The General History of Africa highlights the role of European commercial firms in linking Africa with Western markets, emphasizing exploitative practices through unequal exchange, where African producers received little for their goods while paying high prices for imports. This reflects the economic opportunities for European traders and the exploitation of African resources, with monopolistic trading companies controlling prices to ensure profits flowed to them rather than to Africans. The colonial focus on primary product exports and the neglect of industrialization further underscore the exploitative economic system. Although the textbook does not specifically mention the Company of African Merchants, these broader patterns suggest that its profitability was likely tied to such exploitative dynamics. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence of the company's economic success, noting an interim dividend of eight percent for the half-year ending June 30th, with expectations of a higher dividend, indicating successful trading activities and economic opportunities in African trade. However, the articles do not explicitly address exploitation, focusing instead on economic success, and mention other economic activities like the formation of the South African Company to manage diamond claims. This absence of direct references to exploitation in the articles contrasts with the textbook's emphasis on exploitative practices, highlighting a gap in the discussion of the underlying dynamics of colonial trade.

# The appointment of British officials like Sir William Alexander George Young to various colonial positions suggests a pattern of administrative control and influence over African territories by the British Empire.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore a pattern of administrative control and influence over African territories by the British Empire through the appointment of British officials. The General History of Africa highlights the British strategy of indirect rule, where local chiefs and authorities were appointed to administer regions on behalf of the colonial government, thereby maintaining control with minimal direct intervention. This approach is exemplified by figures like Sir Frederick Lugard in Northern Nigeria, who utilized existing indigenous institutions for colonial administration, and the creation of new administrative units like the warrant chief system in Nigeria. The textbook illustrates a broader theme of British administrative influence through military conquests and bureaucratic structures in regions like Nigeria and the Gold Coast, although it does not specifically mention Sir William Alexander George Young. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific examples of this pattern through the careers of British officials like Sir William Alexander George Young, who held numerous colonial positions, including Acting Governor of the Gold Coast, and Sir Francis Fleming, with appointments in Sierra Leone and other colonies. These articles highlight the British Empire's systematic approach to governance by placing experienced officials in key positions across the empire, though they do not delve into the broader implications of this control on African territories. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of the British Empire's administrative strategies in Africa, combining both general practices and specific examples of influential figures.

# The movement of governors between different colonies highlights the interconnected nature of the British colonial system.

The observations from the General History of Africa and The African Times provide complementary insights into the interconnected nature of the British colonial system. While the General History of Africa does not explicitly discuss the movement of governors between colonies, it highlights the interconnectedness of the British colonial system through shared administrative practices, such as indirect rule, and the influence of British economic interests across various colonies. Figures like Sir Frederick Lugard exemplify this interconnectedness through the dissemination of governance strategies rather than the physical movement of governors. In contrast, The African Times offers concrete examples that directly support the claim by detailing the careers of colonial officials like Sir William Alexander George Young, who held positions across multiple colonies, and the reassignment of governors such as Sir Henry A. Blake and Sir Augustus Hemming between different territories. These examples from The African Times illustrate the fluidity and centralized nature of the British colonial administration, where governors were frequently moved to manage different colonies, thereby reinforcing the interconnectedness of the system. Together, these sources underscore a complex network of shared policies, practices, and personnel movements that characterized the British colonial system.

# Colonial officials in Africa sometimes required appeals to higher authorities for the resolution of disputes, indicating a centralized control system.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the centralized control system in colonial Africa, particularly in the context of dispute resolution. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the hierarchical nature of colonial administration, with a governor or resident-general at the top, responsible to the national government, suggesting a centralized system where higher authorities wielded significant control. It describes the role of European administrators in directing both European subordinates and African authorities, with the French system notably using indigenous authorities in a direct and subordinate manner, exemplified by the commandant du cercle as the sole authority. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention the requirement of appeals to higher authorities for dispute resolution, which is a specific aspect of the claim. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide direct evidence supporting the claim, describing a situation where an Acting Administrator's decision could be appealed to higher authorities, such as His Excellency and ultimately Sir Arthur Kennedy, the Governor-in-Chief. This process illustrates a hierarchical system where decisions by lower-level officials could be contested and reviewed by higher authorities, reinforcing the notion of centralized control within colonial governance. Together, these sources underscore the centralized nature of colonial administration, with The African Times offering specific examples of the appeals process that the textbook does not explicitly address.

# The prosecution of African leaders by colonial authorities weakened their ability to maintain order and enforce local laws or customs.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the prosecution of African leaders by colonial authorities weakened their ability to maintain order and enforce local laws or customs. The textbook details how colonial powers often deposed or exiled traditional rulers, diminishing their authority and bringing the institution of chieftaincy into disrepute. By manipulating traditional rulers into administrative agents, the colonial system curtailed their traditional roles and powers, leading to a loss of prestige and respect among their subjects, as seen in revolts and rebellions in places like Ghana. The colonial justice system further undermined traditional authority by allowing subjects to appeal to colonial courts, disrupting pre-existing African political systems. Similarly, The African Times articles describe the prosecution of King Aggery by colonial authorities for allegedly punishing his people according to native laws. Although the charge of unnecessary cruelty was not proven, the reprimand and warning issued to King Aggery undermined his authority and dignity. The articles emphasize that imposing European legal standards without regard for local customs threatened traditional governance structures, potentially leading to a state of anarchy. Both sources illustrate how colonial legal interventions negatively impacted traditional authority, aligning with the claim that such prosecutions weakened African leaders' ability to enforce local laws and maintain order.

# The appointment of Edward Graham Alston as Queen's Advocate for Sierra Leone suggests the British legal system was imposed on African colonies.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the British legal system was imposed on African colonies, though they approach the topic from different angles. The General History of Africa provides a broader context by detailing the introduction of European judicial institutions in African colonies, which often modified or supplanted African customary and Muslim law. It highlights the establishment of courts adhering to European legal principles, such as the Courts of Equity in the Niger Delta, controlled by British traders rather than local rulers, and the imposition of British law through legal conventions in the Gold Coast. These examples underscore the imposition of the British legal system, aligning with the broader context of the claim, despite not specifically mentioning Edward Graham Alston's appointment. In contrast, The African Times confirms Alston's appointment as Queen's Advocate for Her Majesty's Settlement of Sierra Leone, directly indicating the presence of British legal officials and suggesting the implementation of British legal practices in the colony. However, the articles lack a detailed analysis of the broader implications of such appointments, leaving the interpretation of the imposition of the British legal system to be inferred. Together, these sources provide complementary perspectives on the claim, with the textbook offering a broader historical context and the news articles providing specific contemporary evidence.

# Lieutenant Cameron's journey across tropical Africa from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic was considered a significant achievement in the history of African exploration.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the significance of Lieutenant Cameron's journey across tropical Africa from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. The textbook does not mention Cameron or his expedition, focusing instead on other explorers like David Livingstone, Burton, and Speke, and their contributions to the exploration and mapping of East and Central Africa, as well as the impact on missionary work and the Arab slave trade. This absence suggests that Cameron's journey is either not covered in this section or is not deemed significant within the context of the themes being explored. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim of Cameron's journey being a significant achievement in African exploration history. They detail a presentation ceremony where Cameron was awarded a gold chronometer watch by 360 naval officers, highlighting the admiration and recognition of his accomplishment. Admiral Ommanney's remarks during the ceremony emphasized the perilous nature of the journey, and Sir Henry Rawlinson's opinion placed Cameron at the forefront of African explorers, reinforcing the journey's historical importance. Thus, while the textbook omits Cameron's expedition, The African Times celebrates it as a noteworthy and commendable feat.

# The formation of Boer states in South Africa, with their distinct populations and territories, indicates the complex socio-political landscape and the presence of European settler communities in the region.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim regarding the formation of Boer states in South Africa, highlighting the complex socio-political landscape and the presence of European settler communities. The textbook details the emergence of two Boer republics, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, emphasizing the divisions among the Boers, such as the trekboers and the voortrekkers, which contributed to distinct populations and territories. It also illustrates the socio-political complexity through internal divisions within the Boer communities, their interactions with African states like the Sotho kingdom, and the influence of British colonial interests, all within the broader context of European settler colonialism and the impact of the Mfecane on African societies. Meanwhile, The African Times articles mention the recent formation of three Boer states—Stellaland, Land Goshen, and Zululand—providing specific areas and population estimates, including the number of white inhabitants. This information underscores the presence of European settler communities and reflects the intricate dynamics of European settlement and local governance. However, the articles do not explore the broader socio-political implications or interactions between these Boer states and other communities, which the textbook addresses, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved. Together, these sources paint a detailed picture of the multifaceted environment in which distinct Boer states formed, shaped by both internal and external factors.

# The exploration of African geography by European explorers was often celebrated in European societies.

The exploration of African geography by European explorers is depicted differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook emphasizes the utilitarian and strategic aspects of exploration, highlighting the role of explorers like Heinrich Barth and H. M. Stanley in gathering scientific and intelligence information to aid the abolitionist movement and facilitate European trade with Africa's interior markets. It notes the increased European knowledge of Africa by 1880, which contributed to their ability to conquer the continent, but it does not explicitly address whether these explorations were celebrated in European societies. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim that such explorations were often celebrated, as evidenced by the significant recognition given to Captains Speke and Grant for discovering the source of the White Nile, which was a highlight at the Royal Geographical Society's annual meeting and banquet. The presence of Sir Roderick Murchison, the society's President, and the regret over Dr. Norton Shaw's retirement, which emphasized his contributions to the society's prosperity and celebrity, further underscore the celebratory nature of these achievements. However, the articles also present a critical perspective, noting a proposed resolution condemning H. M. Stanley's treatment of natives, indicating that while exploration was celebrated, there was also awareness and criticism of the ethical implications. This nuanced view from The African Times highlights both the celebration and controversy surrounding European exploration in Africa, contrasting with the textbook's focus on practical and strategic purposes.

# The exploration of the Rovuma River by Dr. Livingstone and other expeditions indicates a European interest in understanding and potentially exploiting African natural resources.

The exploration of the Rovuma River by Dr. Livingstone and other expeditions indicates a European interest in understanding and potentially exploiting African natural resources, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights David Livingstone's travels in East and Central Africa, emphasizing his focus on finding navigable rivers to open paths for commerce and Christianity, suggesting an interest in exploiting natural resources. It also discusses the role of explorers and missionaries in gathering strategic intelligence and trade secrets, reinforcing the notion of European interest in exploiting African resources, though it does not specifically mention the Rovuma River exploration. In contrast, The African Times provides details of Dr. Livingstone's exploration of the Rovuma River, highlighting his detailed account of the journey's challenges and distances covered, which underscores a systematic effort to map and understand African geography. This aligns with the broader European interest in exploring Africa, as indicated by numerous expeditions conducted under prestigious organizations like the Royal Geographical Society. However, the articles focus on exploration and mapping efforts without explicitly mentioning resource exploitation, which is a notable difference from the claim. Together, these sources support the idea of European interest in African resources, with varying emphasis on the explicit intent to exploit them.

# The involvement of local African porters and attendants was crucial to the success of European expeditions in Africa, yet their contributions were often overlooked.

The examination of both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveals a nuanced perspective on the claim that local African porters and attendants were crucial to the success of European expeditions in Africa, yet their contributions were often overlooked. The "General History of Africa" does not explicitly address the involvement or contributions of African porters and attendants, focusing instead on broader interactions between Europeans and Africans, such as trade and colonial ambitions. It mentions the use of local transportation systems by European explorers but does not delve into the specific roles played by African porters. In contrast, The African Times articles provide some support for the claim by noting the involvement of African porters in expeditions, such as Captain Speke's concern for returning 23 porters to Zanzibar. However, the articles primarily highlight the achievements of European explorers, with little emphasis on the specific contributions of the African porters. The arrangement by Admiral W. H. Hall to transport the porters back is noted, but their role in the expeditions' success is not elaborated upon, aligning with the claim that their contributions were often underrepresented. Both sources highlight a gap in the recognition and acknowledgment of the crucial roles played by African porters and attendants, underscoring the claim's assertion of their overlooked contributions.

---

# The Royal Geographical Society played a significant role in supporting and recognizing the efforts of explorers in Africa.

The examination of the role of the Royal Geographical Society in supporting and recognizing explorers in Africa reveals a nuanced picture when combining insights from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook notably omits any mention of the Society, instead focusing on missionary societies, individual explorers like Burton, Speke, and Livingstone, and the rise of an educated elite in West Africa. This absence suggests that the textbook does not attribute a significant role to the Society in the context of African exploration, highlighting a potential gap or differing emphasis in its narrative. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a more complex view. They acknowledge the Society's recognition of explorers, exemplified by the awarding of a gold medal to Lieut. Cameron for his contributions to African exploration. However, the articles also criticize the Society for its inconsistent support, particularly in withholding further aid to Cameron after Livingstone's death, which hindered his exploration efforts. Additionally, the Society's broader focus on promoting geographical education, as noted in the second article, does not specifically emphasize African exploration. Thus, while the Society did recognize explorers like Cameron, its support was inconsistent, and its broader educational initiatives were not solely focused on Africa, complicating the claim of its significant role in African exploration.

# The River Niger played a significant role in the exploration and subsequent colonization of West Africa by European powers.

The River Niger played a significant role in the exploration and subsequent colonization of West Africa by European powers, as evidenced by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the efforts of British explorers, such as Richard and John Lander, who successfully traced the course of the Niger River, thereby increasing British interest in the region as a gateway to the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. This discovery facilitated the movement of British traders, missionaries, and humanitarians into the hinterland, leading to the establishment of trading stations and missions along the Niger, such as at Onitsha and Asaba. The Royal Niger Company, which received a royal charter, used the river to establish trading depots and exert governmental powers in the region, despite resistance from local communities, underscoring the river's centrality in the socio-political dynamics of the time. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the river's role in exploration, mentioning M. Gerard's expedition to explore the Kong Mountains and determine the Niger's source, and a presentation by Mr. Joseph Thomson on a trip to Sokoto via the river. While these articles emphasize the river's importance in geographical exploration, they do not explicitly link it to colonization, highlighting a difference in focus between the two sources. Together, these observations illustrate the Niger River's pivotal role in facilitating European exploration and, as detailed in the textbook, its subsequent colonization efforts in West Africa.

# The marketing and use of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline as an effective remedy against diseases like yellow fever and cholera in Africa and Europe.

The claim regarding the marketing and use of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline as an effective remedy against diseases like yellow fever and cholera in Africa and Europe is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not mention Lamplough's Pyretic Saline or its use as a remedy for these diseases, focusing instead on public health measures and medical interventions in Africa during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as vaccines, mosquito suppression, and treatments for diseases like sleeping sickness, syphilis, and leprosy. It highlights the challenges of combating epidemic diseases and the impact of European colonization on health conditions in Africa, but notably omits any reference to Lamplough's Pyretic Saline, suggesting it was not recognized or discussed in the context of public health efforts during the period covered. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the marketing and purported efficacy of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline in reducing susceptibility to fever and treating diseases such as yellow fever, cholera, and jungle fever. The articles cite its successful use in historical outbreaks and endorsements by medical professionals like Dr. Horton, particularly emphasizing its benefits in regions with limited medical access, such as the West Coast of Africa. However, they lack empirical evidence or scientific studies to substantiate these claims, which contrasts with modern standards of medical validation. Thus, while the articles promote Lamplough's Pyretic Saline as a remedy, the absence of its mention in the textbook suggests a lack of recognition or validation in historical public health discourse.

# The outbreak of yellow fever in Senegal and the response by the French colonial administration, including the establishment of a cordon sanitaire.

The claim regarding the outbreak of yellow fever in Senegal and the response by the French colonial administration, including the establishment of a cordon sanitaire, is supported by observations from The African Times but not corroborated by the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times provides detailed accounts confirming the outbreak in Senegal, specifically in St. Louis, as reported in a letter read in the French Legislative Chamber on December 21, 1880. The French colonial administration's response included the establishment of a "severe cordon sanitaire" around St. Louis to protect the rest of the colony, as well as a four-day quarantine for vessels arriving in the Gambia from Goree, another French port, demonstrating proactive measures to contain the epidemic. In contrast, the General History of Africa discusses yellow fever epidemics in the region and the development of a vaccine by 1927 but does not mention a specific outbreak in Senegal or the French response involving a cordon sanitaire. This absence of information in the textbook highlights a notable difference, as it does not corroborate the specific details of the claim, whereas The African Times provides a clear picture of the measures taken by the French authorities to manage the outbreak.

# The spread of yellow fever in West African regions during colonial times as a significant public health challenge.

The spread of yellow fever in West African regions during colonial times was a significant public health challenge, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights yellow fever as one of the prevalent epidemic diseases in the region, alongside smallpox and sleeping sickness, with epidemics occurring unpredictably from Senegal to Sudan. It notes the development of a vaccine in 1927 at the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba, near Lagos, although widespread use did not occur until the Second World War. Until 1935, efforts to combat yellow fever primarily relied on mosquito suppression in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting, underscoring the challenges in controlling the disease. Complementing this, The African Times articles report severe outbreaks in Senegal, particularly in St. Louis and Dakar, with high mortality rates prompting the French Government to send medical personnel and establish quarantine measures, including a cordon sanitaire. The concern over the disease's spread is further illustrated by the quarantine for vessels arriving in the Gambia from Goree. While these articles highlight the immediate responses to outbreaks, they do not delve into the broader public health infrastructure or long-term strategies, which remain areas of interest for historians examining the era's public health challenges. Together, these sources underscore the widespread impact of yellow fever and the significant efforts to contain it during colonial times in West Africa.

# The prioritization of bureaucratic convenience over public health by colonial administrations during disease outbreaks.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that colonial administrations prioritized bureaucratic convenience over public health during disease outbreaks. The textbook highlights that colonial health services were primarily focused on safeguarding European soldiers, administrators, and missionaries, with limited care extended to African populations, indicating a prioritization of European interests over broader public health concerns. Financial considerations often took precedence, as seen during economic downturns like the depression of the 1930s, when health expenditures were cut. The limited availability of medical personnel and facilities for Africans, evidenced by low doctor-to-population ratios and the disproportionate number of hospitals serving Europeans versus Africans, further supports this claim. The emphasis on indirect rule and the use of indigenous personnel in subordinate roles suggests a focus on administrative efficiency rather than comprehensive public health strategies. Meanwhile, The African Times articles describe how Dr. Allan, initially appointed to manage smallpox cases, was reassigned to perform administrative duties at the Governor's office, leaving him with little time for his medical responsibilities despite ongoing health concerns like yellow fever in Bathurst. This reassignment, criticized for prioritizing administrative tasks over medical duties, highlights the potential consequences for public health, particularly for poorer populations reliant on government medical services. The Governor's preference for having Dr. Allan handle bureaucratic tasks, allegedly to free up his own time for personal leisure, further underscores the claim of prioritizing bureaucratic convenience. Together, these sources illustrate a broader pattern of colonial governance that often prioritized bureaucratic efficiency over the well-being of the local population, even during health crises.

# The presence of multiple steamship companies in Africa during this period suggests a significant level of maritime trade and transportation between Africa and other regions.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of a significant level of maritime trade and transportation between Africa and other regions during this period. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines, such as the British African Company and the African Steam-Ship Company, which facilitated contacts between Brazil and the west coast of Africa. This indicates the presence of multiple steamship companies, suggesting a robust maritime trade network. Additionally, the dominance of shipping companies like the Elder Dempster Line and Co Ltd in British West Africa and the Union Castle Line in East and Southern Africa further supports the claim. However, the text does not provide specific details on the extent of steamship operations across the entire continent, which could be seen as a limitation. Similarly, The African Times articles mention the active operations of steamship companies like the African Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, with frequent arrivals and departures of steamers such as the Benin, Calabar, and Africa, indicating a well-established network for trade and transportation. The variety of destinations and regularity of voyages further support the notion of a thriving maritime trade environment. However, the articles lack specific details about the nature of the goods transported or the exact regions connected by these routes, which would be of interest to historians studying the economic impact of these maritime activities. Despite these limitations, both sources align in suggesting substantial maritime trade and transportation during this period.

# The presence of multiple steamship companies in Africa during the late 19th century indicates a significant level of European commercial interest and investment in the region.

The presence of multiple steamship companies in Africa during the late 19th century serves as a strong indicator of significant European commercial interest and investment in the region, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines, such as the British African Company and the African Steam-Ship Company, which facilitated trade between Brazil and the west coast of Africa. This transition from slave ships to steamships marked a shift towards 'legitimate commerce,' underscoring the expansion of European trade in Africa. However, the textbook does not explicitly link the presence of steamship companies to European investment in infrastructure or capital, focusing more on trade dynamics and patterns. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the robust network of maritime operations established by companies like the Royal Mail Steamship Company, the British and African Steam Navigation Company, and the African Steamship Company. These companies' regular arrivals and departures, transporting mails and goods, suggest a well-established infrastructure for trade and communication, reflecting European engagement in the region. While the articles do not delve into the specifics of the goods transported or the economic impact, they align with the claim by highlighting the active presence of European steamship companies, thereby indicating commercial interest and investment. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the significant European commercial activities in Africa during this period.

# The presence of multiple steamship companies indicates competition and significant commercial interest in African trade routes.

The presence of multiple steamship companies indicates competition and significant commercial interest in African trade routes, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the operations of specific companies, such as the British African Company and the African Steam-Ship Company, which regularly operated between Brazil and the west coast of Africa, signifying a structured commercial interest. This shift from slave ships to regular mixed cargo and passenger lines underscores a move towards legitimate trade. However, the textbook emphasizes the dominance of certain lines, like the Elder Dempster Line in British West Africa and the Union Castle Line in East and Southern Africa, suggesting limited competition in some regions. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence of a competitive environment, noting the presence of multiple steamship companies, including the African Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, with frequent arrivals and departures of steamers. This regularity implies robust commercial interest, although the articles lack explicit details about the nature of the competition or specific goods traded. Together, these sources indicate significant commercial interest in African trade routes, with varying degrees of competition depending on the region and period.

# The presence of multiple steamship companies indicates competition and significant economic interest in African trade routes.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced understanding of the claim regarding the presence of multiple steamship companies as indicators of competition and significant economic interest in African trade routes. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines, such as the British African Company and the African Steam-Ship Company, which replaced slave ships and facilitated legitimate trade between Brazil and the west coast of Africa. This shift underscores the economic interest in these routes. The text also notes the dominance of the Elder Dempster Line and Co Ltd in British West Africa by 1900, following the amalgamation of British shipping companies in 1890, and an agreement with the German Woermann line to fix rates, suggesting a competitive environment. However, it does not explicitly discuss the presence of multiple steamship companies as a direct indicator of competition, nor does it delve into the competitive dynamics between these companies. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence of a competitive environment through the presence of multiple steamship companies, such as the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the African Steamship Company, with multiple steamers like the Africa, Loanda, Benguela, and Kinsembo actively engaging in trade routes. While these articles highlight the regularity and importance of these routes, they lack explicit details about the nature of the competition or the broader economic implications, focusing instead on the logistics of arrivals and departures. Together, these sources support the notion of significant economic interest in African trade routes, though they offer limited insight into the competitive dynamics among the steamship companies.

# The presence of European individuals with titles and professions indicates a structured European presence in Africa, possibly related to trade, governance, or missionary work.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of a structured European presence in Africa, primarily related to trade, governance, and missionary work. The General History of Africa highlights the roles of European traders, explorers, and missionaries, such as those from the Church Missionary Society and the Société des Missions Africaines, in shaping the region's economic and social dynamics. European traders from countries like Britain, France, Germany, and Portugal established businesses and residential quarters in major ports, indicating a structured presence for trade. Missionaries played significant roles in spreading Christianity and facilitating European colonialism, suggesting a structured presence related to missionary work. The text also describes a colonial administrative grid that utilized indigenous personnel and institutions, indicating a structured governance system, albeit one that adapted to local dynamics. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the presence of Europeans in various professional roles, such as Mr. John D. M'Laurin and Mr. Theobald in Benin, Captain Lomerio in Cape Coast Castle, and Staff-Surgeon A. F. Elliott in Sierra Leone, as well as Rev. F. Holland in Madeira, indicating possible missionary activities. The articles focus on European involvement in trade, with vessels like the *Daisy* and *Mystic Tie* transporting goods such as palm oil, nuts, and ivory, suggesting an economic-driven presence. However, they do not explicitly mention governance activities, highlighting a notable difference from the textbook's account. Together, these sources depict a European presence in Africa that was structured and multifaceted, driven by trade, missionary work, and governance, though the emphasis on governance varies between the sources.

# The movement and migration patterns of Europeans and possibly Africans during the colonial era are reflected in the travel of families and individuals from Africa to places like Grand Canary and Madeira.

The General History of Africa textbook provides a comprehensive overview of the movement and migration patterns of Africans and Europeans during the colonial era, focusing on the African diaspora primarily through the slave trade and the presence of Africans in Europe from Classical Antiquity onwards, with significant numbers in southern Spain and Portugal from the fifteenth century. It also highlights African migration to the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe, and the return of Afro-Brazilians to West Africa, as well as European settlers moving into Africa, particularly in North, East, and Central Africa. However, it does not specifically mention travel to places like Grand Canary and Madeira, which is a notable difference from the claim. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide a list of passengers on various steamships, reflecting the movement of individuals and families between African locations and places like Grand Canary and Madeira during the colonial era. The presence of European-sounding names, such as Mr. and Mrs. Stewart and their children traveling to Madeira, and the Count of Veza Grande traveling to Grand Canary, suggests European movement, while the inclusion of distressed seamen and individuals from diverse locations such as Sierra Leone, Lagos, and Old Calabar indicates a mix of European and possibly African travelers. This supports the claim of a pattern of movement involving both Europeans and Africans, though the articles do not explicitly mention the reasons for travel, such as migration or colonial administration, which would provide a more direct link to the claim. The absence of explicit details about the motivations behind these travels is a notable difference from the claim, which implies a broader context of migration patterns.

# The movement of individuals between African regions and Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries suggests a significant level of interaction and exchange between Africa and Europe during this period.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of significant interaction and exchange between African regions and Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The textbook highlights the movement of European traders, explorers, missionaries, and students to Africa, alongside African communities in Europe, particularly in roles like domestic service and as students. It emphasizes the impact of the abolitionist movement and the shift from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, which facilitated these interactions. The establishment of commercial routes increased intra-African contacts and opened the hinterland to European influence, while African expatriate communities in Europe and the Americas, and African students in Europe, suggest a bidirectional flow of people and ideas. However, it notes that the African diaspora in Europe was not self-sustaining, requiring constant replenishment from overseas, indicating some limitations in integration. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide evidence of significant movement of individuals, as detailed lists of passengers on steamships between African locations and European destinations, such as Liverpool, include missionaries, captains, seamen, and families, indicating diverse travel purposes like commerce, religious missions, and personal reasons. The presence of European names and titles alongside African locations implies social and economic exchange, though the articles lack explicit details on the nature of these interactions. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted interactions between Africa and Europe during this period, highlighting both the breadth of exchanges and some constraints and imbalances.

# The presence of military personnel and officials among the passengers indicates the ongoing colonial administration and military involvement in African regions by European powers.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence supporting the claim of ongoing colonial administration and military involvement in African regions by European powers. The General History of Africa highlights the transition from military to bureaucratic rule while emphasizing that European arms remained the ultimate authority, indicating a continued military presence. It details the recruitment of indigenous troops for police functions and military campaigns, such as the French conscription law of 1919 and the British Sudan Defence Force, underscoring military involvement in maintaining colonial control. The text also notes the use of African troops in global wars and the suppression of independence movements, further supporting the claim. Additionally, during the First World War, European administrative and commercial personnel were mobilized for war efforts, leaving a reduced European presence in some regions, yet military personnel remained integral to colonial administration. Meanwhile, The African Times articles list various military ranks and personnel, such as Captains, Lieutenants, and Sappers, traveling to and from African locations like Sierra Leone, Cape Coast, and Accra. The presence of officials like His Excellency Col. F. Cardew, C.M.G., and other military figures traveling to Sierra Leone, along with groups of soldiers, underscores a significant military presence. These details align with the historical context of European colonial powers maintaining military and administrative control in African regions. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that supports the claim of continued military involvement while highlighting the evolving nature of colonial administration.

# The frequent departures from Liverpool to various African destinations suggest a significant level of interaction and movement between Europe and Africa during this period.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of significant interaction and movement between Europe and Africa during the period in question. The General History of Africa highlights the presence of African communities in European port towns, indicating frequent maritime connections, and describes the activities of European traders, missionaries, and explorers who traveled between coastal African ports, seeking trade opportunities and exploring interior markets. It also notes the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines between Brazil and the west coast of Africa, marking a shift towards legitimate trade and increased interaction. Although the textbook does not specifically mention Liverpool, it provides a broader context of European-African interactions. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically document frequent departures from Liverpool to various African destinations, such as Grand Canary, Sierra Leone, Cape Coast, and Lagos, illustrating a robust network of travel and communication. The detailed passenger lists, featuring individuals from diverse professions like captains, judges, doctors, and missionaries, suggest varied purposes for travel, including business, governance, and religious missions. While the articles do not delve into the nature or impact of these interactions, they underscore the extensive and multifaceted connections between Europe and Africa, complementing the broader context provided by the textbook. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of the significant movement and interaction between the two continents during this period.

# The return of Sir A. Kennedy as Governor-in-Chief and the warm reception he received may indicate a complex relationship between colonial administrators and the local populace, possibly involving both approval and dissent.

The claim regarding the return of Sir A. Kennedy as Governor-in-Chief and the warm reception he received, indicating a complex relationship between colonial administrators and the local populace, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. While the textbook does not specifically mention Sir A. Kennedy, it discusses the broader theme of complex relationships between colonial authorities and local populations, characterized by both approval and dissent. It highlights the use of indirect rule, the cultivation of conflict between traditional and new elites, and resistance movements against colonial policies, suggesting a nuanced dynamic of cooperation and opposition. In contrast, The African Times provides specific details about Sir A. Kennedy's return to Sierra Leone, noting the enthusiastic welcome and the deputation of prominent local figures, which suggest approval and respect for his leadership. The address presented to him reflects sentiments of "unaltered pleasure and unbroken loyalty," indicating a positive view of his governance. However, Kennedy's own response acknowledges the possibility of dissent, as he notes that the welcoming gestures do not necessarily mean endorsement of all his opinions or actions. This acknowledgment implies an awareness of underlying complexities in the relationship, aligning with the claim of a nuanced dynamic between colonial administrators and the local community. Together, these observations from both sources underscore the intricate and multifaceted nature of colonial relationships, marked by both cooperation and potential dissent.

# The public's scorn for the high officials' refusal to honor Sir Arthur Kennedy highlights a contrast between popular opinion and official protocol or etiquette.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim regarding public scorn for high officials' refusal to honor Sir Arthur Kennedy. The General History of Africa does not directly address this specific incident, focusing instead on broader themes of resistance to colonial rule, the dynamics between traditional and new elites, and socio-political challenges in African societies under colonialism. It mentions public discontent and resistance but does not link these to any event involving Sir Arthur Kennedy. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed support for the claim, describing a spontaneous and enthusiastic public reception for Sir Arthur Kennedy, which highlights widespread affection and respect for him. The articles contrast this with the high officials' refusal to organize an address for Sir Arthur, citing etiquette and good taste, a move perceived as insincere and hypocritical, especially given their previous praise for Colonel Blackall, described as "the worst of rulers." The public's reaction to the officials' refusal is one of scorn and ridicule, underscoring a tension between popular sentiment and official conduct. This contrast between the sources highlights the absence of specific details in the textbook while emphasizing the vivid depiction of public sentiment in the news articles.

# Haczar's story reflects the complexities of individual ambition and morality within the broader context of colonial society.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that Haczar's story reflects the complexities of individual ambition and morality within the broader context of colonial society. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced exploration of how colonial legal and moral codes offered opportunities for social mobility, allowing individuals to rise in status based on ability and destiny, which aligns with the theme of personal ambition seen in Haczar's story. It also highlights the alienation and resentment experienced by educated Africans, caught between admiration for European culture and the reality of racial discrimination, mirroring the moral dilemmas faced by individuals like Haczar. Furthermore, the text addresses the broader social impacts of colonialism, such as the deterioration of women's status and the imposition of foreign cultural values, influencing individual moral choices. However, it does not specifically mention Haczar, indicating a difference in narrative focus. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details about Haczar's life, illustrating his natural inclination towards opportunism, ambition to pursue a legal career, and moral ambiguities, such as his willingness to lie and manipulate situations. His mentorship under Judge Spongeson and interactions with Alcock further underscore the tension between personal ambition and ethical conduct. Haczar's realization of the financial limitations imposed by colonial economic structures on his aspirations highlights the constraints of the colonial context. While the articles do not explicitly address the broader societal implications of colonialism, they vividly depict the intricate interplay of ambition and morality in Haczar's life, aligning with the claim. Together, these sources illustrate the complex dynamics of individual ambition and morality within the colonial framework, despite their differing narrative focuses.

# The imposition of British legal systems and practices on African colonies is evident in the roles and structures established in Sierra Leone.

The imposition of British legal systems and practices on African colonies, particularly in Sierra Leone, is well-documented through observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the introduction of a new judicial system by colonial rulers, which was retained in most independent states, including Sierra Leone, aligning with the claim of British legal imposition. The establishment of Courts of Equity, primarily composed of British traders, further illustrates the dominance of British legal practices over local laws. Additionally, the role of missionaries and the British anti-slavery movement in shaping Sierra Leone's society indirectly supported the establishment of British legal and administrative structures. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide evidence of the appointment of Charles Fyfe and James Abram McCarthy as Queen's Advocates for the settlement and colony of Sierra Leone, respectively, indicating the establishment of British legal roles within the colony. These positions, held by individuals with legal expertise, suggest the implementation of British legal frameworks and practices in the governance of Sierra Leone, as underscored by official communications from Downing Street. However, the articles do not delve into the specific legal systems or practices implemented, nor do they mention any local legal systems, highlighting potential areas of interest for historians studying the extent and nature of British legal influence in African colonies. Together, these sources collectively support the claim that British legal systems and practices were imposed on Sierra Leone during the colonial period.

# The interconnectedness of European and African regions through colonial networks is highlighted by various events and activities.

The interconnectedness of European and African regions through colonial networks is highlighted by various events and activities, as observed in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a detailed account of this interconnectedness, emphasizing the movement of European traders, explorers, and missionaries into Africa, driven by abolitionist motives and commercial interests, which necessitated interaction with local African systems and networks. It illustrates the establishment of trading centers and the introduction of new commodities by Europeans, as well as the impact of European colonial powers on African political and economic structures, such as the imposition of European bureaucratic systems and the partitioning of Africa. Treaties and agreements between European powers regarding African territories further underscore the political interconnectedness, though the text also notes the divisive nature of European influence, leading to politically structured differentiation and suspicion among African states. Meanwhile, The African Times articles provide implicit support for this claim by highlighting events such as the marriage of the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia and Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, which underscores ties between European royal families and their colonial interests in Africa. The mention of Sierra Leone readers and others along the West Coast of Africa who remember the Duke's visit, along with the shared concern over his illness, suggests a connection between British colonial interests and European royal activities. However, the articles focus more on European events and figures, with African regions mentioned primarily in relation to their colonial status. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the interconnectedness between European and African regions, while also highlighting the complexities and consequences of these interactions.

# The cultural imposition of European customs and products on African societies during the colonial period is reflected in different aspects of life.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim regarding the cultural imposition of European customs and products on African societies during the colonial period. The General History of Africa highlights this imposition as a significant aspect of colonialism, noting that European settlers, missionaries, and administrators often condemned African cultural practices, such as music, art, and religion, and imposed European customs instead. This is evident in the forced adoption of European names and the discouragement of traditional African dress. The text also discusses the selective adaptation and blending of European and African cultural elements, such as the integration of Christian and traditional rites by the Nguni and the Igbo, and the impact of European education policies and cultural assimilation efforts in French, Portuguese, and Spanish territories. Despite these pressures, the resilience and survival of African cultural forms are noted, as they adapted and sometimes thrived. The African Times articles further illustrate this imposition by highlighting the prominence of European events, such as the marriage of European royalty, in African contexts, and the administrative control exerted by European powers, as seen in British officials managing affairs in West Africa. The promotion of European products, like English goods by Brierley & Company and pens designed for British professional standards, underscores the economic imposition. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the African response or adaptation to these impositions, an interesting omission compared to the textbook's acknowledgment of the complexity and variability of African responses. Together, these sources illustrate the pervasive influence of European customs on various aspects of African life during the colonial period, while also highlighting the complexity of African responses.

# The abolishment of trial by jury in civil cases was seen as a significant injustice by the local population in British colonies in Africa.

The claim that the abolishment of trial by jury in civil cases was seen as a significant injustice by the local population in British colonies in Africa is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook focuses on broader colonial grievances such as racial discrimination, economic exploitation, and cultural suppression, without specifically mentioning the legal system or the presence or absence of trial by jury in civil cases. This absence suggests that the issue may not have been a prominently documented grievance within the broader context of colonial injustices discussed in the text. In contrast, The African Times provides substantial evidence supporting the claim, detailing a protest against an ordinance abolishing trial by jury in civil actions. The articles highlight strong community opposition, with numerous merchants, traders, and members of the Chamber of Commerce signing the protest, and a petition with 800 signatures from public meetings throughout the colony. The protestors viewed the ordinance as an intolerable wrong and gross injustice, emphasizing their desire to communicate their objections to Her Majesty’s Ministers. This indicates that the abolishment of trial by jury in civil cases was indeed perceived as a significant injustice by the local population, and the sentiment may have been shared across multiple colonies on the West Coast of Africa.

# The imposition of the house and land tax and its eventual repeal in Sierra Leone suggests a shift in colonial economic policy or priorities.

The examination of the imposition and repeal of the house and land tax in Sierra Leone, as discussed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, presents a nuanced view of colonial economic policy. The General History of Africa highlights the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898, which was a direct response to the imposition of a tax on houses, underscoring the tax as a significant point of contention and resistance against colonial rule. This supports the claim that such taxes were a notable aspect of colonial economic policy aimed at enforcing economic control and labor recruitment across Africa. However, the textbook does not mention the repeal of the tax or any resulting shifts in colonial economic policy, leaving a gap in addressing the claim fully. In contrast, The African Times articles confirm the repeal of the house and land tax through the House and Land Tax Repeal Ordinance of 1872, which annulled a previous ordinance from 1854. Despite confirming the repeal, the articles do not provide insights into the reasons behind this legislative change or any broader shifts in colonial economic priorities, thus not directly supporting the claim of a policy shift. Together, these sources document the imposition and repeal of the tax but do not conclusively address the implications for colonial economic policy, highlighting a gap in the historical narrative regarding the motivations and consequences of these actions.

# The widespread use and endorsement of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline reflect the 19th-century reliance on chemical compounds for treating febrile and digestive disorders.

The claim regarding the widespread use and endorsement of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline in the 19th century for treating febrile and digestive disorders is supported by observations from The African Times but not reflected in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of the reliance on chemical compounds during that era, featuring numerous testimonials from medical professionals like Dr. Sparks, G. D. Sawrey, Thomas Carr Jackson, and David Morgan. These endorsements highlight the compound's efficacy in treating conditions such as gastric complaints, febrile dyspepsia, low fevers, and diarrhea, and describe it as an "admirable Febrifuge" and "Refrigerant Medicine," particularly useful in warm climates and for diseases like cholera and fever. The articles emphasize its chemical properties and preparation, illustrating the 19th-century medical community's trust in such compounds. However, the General History of Africa textbook does not mention Lamplough's Pyretic Saline or similar chemical treatments, focusing instead on the prevalence of diseases like sleeping sickness, malaria, and syphilis, the establishment of medical services and schools, and the impact of European colonization on health and commerce. This absence suggests a difference in emphasis, as the textbook does not highlight the reliance on specific chemical compounds for treating febrile and digestive disorders during the 19th century.

# Ginger was the primary export from Sierra Leone to America and Great Britain, highlighting a limited range of export products.

The claim that ginger was the primary export from Sierra Leone to America and Great Britain, highlighting a limited range of export products, is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide direct support for the claim, as it mentions ginger only as part of early efforts to develop export crops in Sierra Leone, alongside sugar and indigo, without specifying it as a primary export. Instead, the textbook highlights coffee and timber as significant exports and discusses the broader context of monoculture economies with a focus on a limited range of export products, but ginger is not specifically identified as a primary export. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing that ginger was indeed a chief export, with values of £4,830 and £4,540 to America and £1,523 to Great Britain, respectively, in two separate articles. Despite a slight discrepancy in the value of ginger exports to America, both articles emphasize ginger's prominence in the export trade and highlight the underdeveloped state of the Colony's resources and the limited variety of export products. Thus, while the textbook does not corroborate the claim, the news articles underscore ginger's significance in Sierra Leone's export economy during that period.

# The trade system in Bathurst relied heavily on credit, which created opportunities for dishonest practices among traders and dealers.

The claim that the trade system in Bathurst relied heavily on credit, creating opportunities for dishonest practices among traders and dealers, is supported by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with differing levels of specificity. The textbook provides a broader context of trade and credit in colonial Africa, highlighting issues such as monopolistic tendencies of merchant firms, challenges African businessmen faced in securing bank loans due to lack of collateral and racial prejudice, and the exploitation of African producers through unfair pricing and trade practices. These factors suggest a potential for dishonest practices in colonial trade systems, though the textbook does not specifically address Bathurst. In contrast, The African Times articles offer direct evidence related to Bathurst, describing its trade as "essentially a credit one," where traders controlled goods valued between 500 to 5,000 dollars until the end of the groundnut season. This system allowed for dishonest practices, such as traders investing in slaves and bullocks instead of the intended commodities, and the abolition of arrest for debt further reduced control over these traders, leading to gross embezzlements. The introduction of the Leboos from Senegal as traders initially seemed promising, but they too eventually engaged in embezzlement, indicating systemic issues within the credit-based trade system. Together, these observations illustrate how the reliance on credit facilitated fraudulent activities among traders and dealers in Bathurst, with the news articles providing specific examples that the textbook's broader context helps to understand.

# European merchants engaged in deceptive practices by manipulating trade goods, such as tradecloth, to exploit African markets.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that European merchants engaged in deceptive practices to exploit African markets, albeit with different emphases. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the broader economic manipulations by European traders, such as manipulating trade agreements and loan servicing to gain control over African economies. It describes the unequal exchange where European traders paid little for African produce while charging high prices for imported goods, and the monopolistic control exerted by firms like the United Africa Company, which marginalized African traders. However, it does not specifically mention the manipulation of trade goods like tradecloth. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of such deceptive practices, detailing how merchants used heavy pieces of board concealed within tradecloth to increase the perceived weight and value of the goods, and the fraudulent folding of piece goods to shortchange African buyers. These articles highlight the negative impact on the local population and suggest a systemic issue, with European commission agents specializing in these deceptive practices. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of European exploitation in African markets, with the textbook focusing on broader economic strategies and the articles providing specific examples of trade good manipulation.

# European merchants exploited African traders by engaging in fraudulent business practices.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that European merchants exploited African traders through fraudulent business practices. The textbook details how European commercial firms engaged in unequal exchanges by paying minimal amounts for African produce while charging exorbitant prices for imported goods, effectively transferring the surplus generated by peasant production to middlemen and stifling local economic reinvestment. It also describes how European traders manipulated African rulers into incurring heavy debts with European banks, using these debts to secure rights to produce and customs duties in advance, thereby undermining African economies and rulers' control. Furthermore, European traders secured excessive privileges through treaties, weakening African rulers' ability to regulate trade, and demanded the opening of Sudanese ivory markets to free trade, which intensified slave trading when profit margins fell. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles highlight specific deceptive practices, such as selling "semi-poisonous compounds under the name of gin" and exploiting the traditional buying practices of African traders by manipulating the number of folds in woven goods. These examples illustrate how European merchants leveraged economic power and manipulated trade terms to their advantage, often at the expense of African traders and economies, thereby aligning with the claim of exploitation through fraudulent practices.

---

# The credit system in Lagos in the late 19th century facilitated dishonest transactions and contributed to economic instability.

The claim that the credit system in Lagos in the late 19th century facilitated dishonest transactions and contributed to economic instability is supported by observations from The African Times, though not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles provide substantial evidence, describing how inexperienced European merchants imprudently supplied goods to traders without proper securities, leading to significant financial losses. This lack of due diligence allowed traders to engage in fraudulent activities, such as exaggerating the market value of their properties to secure larger credits than warranted. The articles also highlight how this system enabled traders to undersell capitalists and engage in ruinous competition, threatening the stability of honest capitalists who could not compete with those who had nothing to lose. Furthermore, the credit system encouraged extravagance and debt accumulation, as individuals adopted new, expensive lifestyles upon receiving large credits, often without the intention of repaying the loans. In contrast, the General History of Africa does not specifically address the credit system in Lagos or its role in facilitating dishonest transactions and economic instability. However, it does mention economic hardships and manipulation by European merchants and banks in West Africa, implying a broader context of economic instability and exploitation. The textbook discusses the role of European traders and the impact of external economic forces on African economies, which might indirectly relate to issues of credit and economic instability, but it lacks explicit mention of Lagos or the specific credit system issues highlighted by The African Times.

# The exposure of trade frauds by individuals like Otito-Koro highlights the need for legal reforms to address commercial malpractices in Africa.

The claim that the exposure of trade frauds by individuals like Otito-Koro highlights the need for legal reforms to address commercial malpractices in Africa is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit in different ways. The General History of Africa does not mention Otito-Koro or specific instances of trade fraud exposure by individuals, but it does discuss various forms of commercial malpractices and exploitation, such as the forced shipment of indigenous Liberians, exploitative European commercial firms, and monopolistic practices in Southern Rhodesia. These examples underscore the necessity for legal reforms to address such issues, aligning with the claim's emphasis on reform. The text also highlights inefficiencies in the marketing system for African producers, suggesting a need for change. In contrast, The African Times provides direct support for the claim by detailing fraudulent practices, such as inserting heavy boards into satteen cloth to deceive buyers, and highlighting Otito-Koro's efforts to expose these malpractices. His communication with the Liverpool and Manchester Chambers of Commerce underscores a push for broader awareness and action. The articles explicitly call for legal measures to address such frauds, paralleling existing laws against adulterating produce, and express hope for government intervention, reinforcing the claim's focus on legal reform. Together, these sources illustrate the broader context of commercial malpractices in Africa and the specific instances that drive the call for legal changes.

# The success of missionary work in Africa was heavily dependent on the attitudes and actions of individual missionaries who valued and respected African contributions.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the claim that the success of missionary work in Africa was heavily dependent on the attitudes and actions of individual missionaries who valued and respected African contributions. The "General History of Africa" highlights figures like James Johnson, who advocated for African evangelization by Africans and criticized racial inferiority doctrines, reflecting a respect for African agency. Similarly, Protestant missions aimed to foster a middle class and spread education, indicating a recognition of African potential. However, the text also notes missionaries who dismissed African religion and culture, focusing solely on conversions, as exemplified by Mgr. Bessieux in Gabon, and those complicit in colonial expansion, which undermined African autonomy. This suggests that while some missionaries valued African contributions, others did not, making the success of missionary work dependent on individual attitudes but not uniformly so. Complementing this, The African Times articles emphasize the positive impact of missionaries like Mr. Milum in Lagos, who promoted competent African schoolmasters to reverend positions, contrasting with the Wesleyan Society's previous neglect. This underscores the crucial role of individual attitudes, as seen in Mr. Milum's respect for African capabilities, in the success of missionary efforts. The articles also mention the Church Missionary Society's success, hinting at a potentially more inclusive approach, though lacking specific details. Together, these sources illustrate that individual missionaries who valued African contributions significantly influenced the success of missionary work, though this was not a universal trait among all missionaries.

# The Ashantee invasion of the Gold Coast was facilitated by previous maladministration rather than the actions of Governor Pine.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the Ashantee invasion of the Gold Coast was facilitated by previous maladministration rather than the actions of Governor Pine. The textbook does not directly address this claim but offers context about the political and social dynamics in the region, highlighting resistance to colonial policies such as a poll tax instituted by Governor Pine, which was abandoned due to strong opposition. This suggests some level of maladministration and broader dissatisfaction that could have contributed to the Ashantee's actions. However, it does not explicitly link these issues to the invasion or specifically attribute it to Governor Pine. Instead, it underscores broader colonial tensions and conflicts, including the Asante's military engagements with the British. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by arguing that Governor Pine, having only recently assumed his position, had limited influence over the events. They suggest that the invasion's objective was the capture of Agiman, chief of eastern Akim, due to a personal insult, rather than any actions by Pine. The articles emphasize the disunity between Agiman and King Attah of the Akims, resulting from past mismanagement, as a key factor that weakened the region and made it vulnerable to Ashantee aggression. This disunity is attributed to the negligence of a former governor, while Governor Pine is portrayed as a proactive leader attempting to resolve the situation. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view that highlights the role of previous maladministration and broader colonial tensions in facilitating the Ashantee invasion, while defending Governor Pine's actions.

---

# The disunity between Agiman and King Attah of Akim was a significant factor in the Ashantee's successful incursion.

The claim that the disunity between Agiman and King Attah of Akim was a significant factor in the Ashantee's successful incursion is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not mention any specific disunity between Agiman and King Attah as a contributing factor to the Ashantee's success. Instead, it focuses on the broader conflicts involving the Asante, including their interactions with the British, internal dynamics, and military strategies, without highlighting any internal divisions within Akim. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts supporting the claim, describing a civil war between Agiman and his nephew, King Attah, which led to disunity among the chiefs of Akim. This division is portrayed as a critical factor that weakened Akim's defense capabilities, allowing the Ashantees to successfully conduct their incursion. The articles argue that a united Akim would have deterred the Ashantee attack, suggesting that the internal conflict provided the Ashantees with a strategic advantage. Thus, while the textbook omits this aspect, The African Times emphasizes the significance of the disunity in facilitating the Ashantee's incursion.

---

# The Ashantee's success in their recent campaign was due to the internal divisions within Akim, not Governor Pine's policies.

The claim that the Ashantee's success in their recent campaign was due to internal divisions within Akim, rather than Governor Pine's policies, is addressed differently by the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not provide specific information directly linking the Ashantee's success to internal divisions within Akim. Instead, it highlights various factors contributing to the Ashantee's historical power, such as their political and administrative organization, military campaigns, and interactions with European powers. While it mentions conflicts involving the Ashantee and other Akan states, including Akim, it does not explicitly attribute Ashantee success to internal divisions within Akim. Additionally, Governor Pine's policies are discussed in the context of resistance movements and taxation issues on the Gold Coast, without a direct connection to the Ashantee's military success. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by emphasizing the disunity between Agiman and King Attah of Akim, resulting from a civil war and exacerbated by the negligence of a former governor, which created an opportunity for the Ashantee general Owosookokoh to strike successfully. The articles argue that this division weakened Akim's ability to present a united front against the Ashantees, facilitating their success. Furthermore, they defend Governor Pine, stating that he was not responsible for these internal divisions and acted appropriately to protect the protectorate. This perspective aligns with the claim by attributing the Ashantee's success to the internal strife within Akim rather than any fault in Governor Pine's administration.

# The lack of transparency and open inquiry into colonial administration hindered the identification and resolution of abuses and injustices.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the claim that the lack of transparency and open inquiry into colonial administration significantly hindered the identification and resolution of abuses and injustices. The textbook highlights the authoritarian nature of colonial systems, which were not designed to confer political power upon Africans, thereby limiting transparency and accountability. It points to the paternalistic attitude of colonial administrators and the manipulation of indigenous governance systems, which obscured the identification of abuses. The colonial judicial systems often disregarded African customary law, and the imposition of taxes and forced labor without proper representation exemplified the lack of open inquiry. Additionally, the limited scrutiny of colonial records and the reluctance of colonial powers to examine their practices, as seen in the superficial League of Nations' investigation in Liberia, further illustrate this lack of transparency. Complementing these insights, The African Times articles criticize the superficial nature of inspections by commissioners, which are pre-announced, allowing local authorities to present a misleadingly positive image. The articles express skepticism about the reliability of information gathered during such visits, noting that personal relationships between commissioners and local governors may prevent genuine scrutiny. The absence of public disclosure of the commissioners' proceedings further aligns with the claim of a lack of transparency. Together, these observations highlight how the colonial administration's lack of transparency and accountability perpetuated injustices and hindered their resolution, as the processes in place seemed designed to protect the status quo rather than facilitate open inquiry and accountability.

# Some British officials believed that colonies could be burdensome and should be relinquished if they were more beneficial to other nations.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that some British officials believed colonies could be burdensome and should be relinquished if they were more beneficial to other nations. The General History of Africa highlights that successive British governments were hesitant to assume full political control over the South African region due to the potential financial burdens, opting instead for strategies like granting self-rule to the Cape Colony and Natal to minimize costs. This suggests a pragmatic approach to colonial management focused on cost-efficiency and strategic interests, such as maintaining a naval base on the Cape peninsula, rather than explicitly relinquishing colonies for the benefit of other nations. In contrast, The African Times articles provide more direct support for the claim, with Earl Granville explicitly stating that retaining a burdensome colony that could benefit another nation is absurd, indicating a willingness to sever such colonies. The articles also discuss the Gambia settlement, described as a "pestilential place not worth having," reinforcing the view of certain colonies as liabilities. However, they introduce a complexity not directly addressed in the claim, as officials like Colonel Sykes emphasized the importance of obtaining consent from British subjects before transferring territories to foreign jurisdictions. This suggests that while some officials were open to relinquishing burdensome colonies, they were also mindful of the rights and implications for British subjects residing there. Together, these sources illustrate that while the notion of colonies as burdensome was present, the decision to relinquish them involved careful consideration of various factors.

# The Anamaboe Temperance Society was actively promoting temperance in Africa during the mid-19th century.

The claim that the Anamaboe Temperance Society was actively promoting temperance in Africa during the mid-19th century is supported by observations from The African Times but not addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook primarily focuses on religious, educational, and political movements, as well as the influence of missionary activities and the rise of African nationalism and Ethiopianism, without mentioning the Anamaboe Temperance Society or any specific temperance movements. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed accounts of the society's activities, including its structured meetings at the Wesleyan Chapel, such as the second anniversary and annual meetings in 1864. These events were attended by prominent figures like S. C. Brew, Esq., J.P., President R. I. Ghartey, and King Amoanoo, King of Anamaboe, highlighting the society's organized efforts and influence. The society's initiatives included electing officers, appointing advocates, expanding a temperance well with support from King Coffee Apfary, and successfully recruiting new members, as evidenced by eighteen new pledges at Kuntu. These details from The African Times illustrate the society's active promotion of temperance and its impact on the local community, aligning with the claim, despite the absence of such information in the General History of Africa.

# The temperance movement in 19th century Africa was actively supported by local religious leaders, such as the Wesleyan minister Rev. James A. Solomon.

The examination of the claim regarding the temperance movement in 19th century Africa reveals differing levels of detail from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information about the temperance movement or its support by local religious leaders, such as the Wesleyan minister Rev. James A. Solomon. Instead, it focuses on the role of liberated Africans, the emergence of an educated elite, and various religious and socio-political movements, without directly referencing the temperance movement or Rev. Solomon's involvement. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing Rev. James A. Solomon's active participation as a Wesleyan teetotal native minister who chaired the third anniversary meeting of the Temperance Society in Anamaboe and delivered a significant speech. This confirms his involvement as a religious leader supporting the movement. However, the articles do not elaborate on the broader involvement of other religious leaders or the extent of religious support across Africa. They do highlight the participation of secular figures like King Amoanoo, suggesting a wider base of support beyond religious leaders. Thus, while the articles confirm Rev. Solomon's involvement, they also indicate secular support, a nuance not addressed in the claim.

# Temperance societies in Africa during the 1860s were gaining new members and were seen as a positive force for social change.

The claim that temperance societies in Africa during the 1860s were gaining new members and were seen as a positive force for social change is supported by observations from The African Times but not mentioned in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook primarily focuses on the effects of colonial rule, the rise of new organizations, the emergence of an educated elite, and various social transformations in Africa during the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the formation of ethnic-based welfare associations and the abolitionist movement. However, it does not specifically reference temperance societies or their influence during the 1860s, suggesting that either such societies were not prominent during this period in Africa or were not considered significant enough to be included in this historical account. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide several details supporting the claim, noting that the temperance movement continued to thrive on the Coast despite challenges like the Ashantee affair. Societies, such as the one in Accra, experienced an increase in membership, with Mr. Cheetham's report highlighting the encouraging growth and new members joining almost daily. Celebrations like the teetotal birthday at Manquadie, which received public approbation and contributions, indicate the movement's high regard within the community. Additionally, the third anniversary meeting of the Temperance Society in Anamaboe, chaired by Rev. James A. Solomon, underscores the movement's positive influence, attracting new members and inspiring hope for social improvement. These details from The African Times align with the claim, demonstrating that temperance societies were indeed gaining traction and contributing to social change during this period.

# The introduction of alcohol by colonial powers had detrimental effects on African societies, leading to social and personal harm.

The introduction of alcohol by colonial powers had detrimental effects on African societies, leading to social and personal harm, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights that the influx of strong alcoholic drinks, cheaply produced in Europe and sold for immense profits in Africa, had deleterious effects on health and contributed significantly to government revenue and customs duties in regions like the Niger Coast Protectorate. Despite attempts to regulate the trade, such as the Brussels Act of 1892, these efforts were largely unsuccessful until the eve of the First World War. This aligns with the claim by illustrating the negative social and economic impacts, including health deterioration and economic exploitation. However, the text also presents a contrasting view from Mary Kingsley, who found the trade spirit pure and less harmful than cannabis, indicating some debate over the extent of alcohol's detrimental effects. The African Times articles further support the claim by highlighting the negative impact of alcohol consumption through anecdotes, such as a man meeting a tragic end under the influence of alcohol, serving as a cautionary tale about its dangers. The articles describe "vile European spirits termed trade rum and gin" contributing to demoralization in Lagos and note efforts by individuals like Mr. J. P. Haastrup to promote temperance, evidenced by the establishment of "FitzGerald Hall" as a center for the temperance movement. However, the articles do not explicitly link these issues to colonial powers, which is a notable difference from the claim. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of alcohol's harmful effects on African societies, acknowledging both the colonial introduction and the broader social consequences.

# The Women's Christian Temperance Union in Freetown was a pioneering organization in the colony, advocating for total abstinence rather than moderation in alcohol consumption.

The claim that the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Freetown was a pioneering organization advocating for total abstinence rather than moderation in alcohol consumption is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit in different ways. The General History of Africa does not specifically mention the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Freetown or its advocacy efforts. However, it discusses the broader temperance movement in Africa, highlighting the influence of Christian missionaries and African leaders like Kgama and Lewanika, who, after converting to Christianity, imposed stringent liquor laws and banned the brewing of African beer, reflecting a push towards abstinence. This aligns with the temperance movement's goals, though the specific organization in Freetown is not covered. In contrast, The African Times provides direct support for the claim, detailing that the Union's meeting on July 4 was the first of its kind in the colony, underscoring its pioneering nature. The articles confirm that the Union advocated for total abstinence, as evidenced by the chairman's address, which interpreted temperance as total abstinence, supported by biblical references. The Union's objective to restore peace and happiness to homes affected by intemperance further emphasizes its focus on total abstinence. Thus, while the textbook provides context on the temperance movement's presence in Africa, The African Times specifically highlights the pioneering role and advocacy efforts of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Freetown.

# The negative effects of the alcohol trade in Africa were considered by some to be more harmful than the historical impacts of the slave trade.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that the negative effects of the alcohol trade in Africa were considered by some to be more harmful than the historical impacts of the slave trade. The General History of Africa offers a nuanced view, acknowledging the deleterious health effects of the alcohol trade, with spirits being distributed on a large scale and even used as wages. However, it extensively discusses the catastrophic impacts of the slave trade, including the destruction of social and political structures, economic distortions, and the loss of labor power, describing it as a complete catastrophe for Africa with significant social, economic, and demographic consequences. The text does not directly compare the two trades in terms of harm, and thus does not support the claim that the alcohol trade was considered more harmful. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence supporting the claim, citing a document from the Y.M.C.A. of Abeokuta that starkly criticizes the rum and gin trade, stating it brutalizes the natives and suggesting it does more harm than the "accursed slave-trade." The articles highlight the perceived severe damage of the alcohol trade, noting the deterioration of Native races and increased drunkenness in villages. They also discuss the need for a more complete understanding and uniformity of practice among European powers regarding duties on merchandise, including spirits, indicating a broader context that includes both social and economic implications. Together, these sources illustrate a complex discourse on the relative harms of the alcohol and slave trades in Africa, with The African Times providing a perspective that some considered the alcohol trade more damaging, a view not reflected in the General History of Africa.

# The West African natives demonstrated temperate habits in their consumption of alcohol, contrary to the belief that imported spirits would have a demoralizing influence.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present a complex and nuanced view of alcohol consumption among West African natives, challenging the claim that they demonstrated temperate habits contrary to the belief that imported spirits would have a demoralizing influence. The General History of Africa notes that the trade of strong alcoholic drinks into Africa had a deleterious effect on health, with spirits often distributed as wages, suggesting significant consumption and potential demoralization. However, it also highlights efforts by African leaders like Kgama and Lewanika to banish public alcohol use and impose stringent liquor laws, indicating a push towards temperance. Similarly, The African Times presents contrasting perspectives: one article supports the claim by citing Colonial Secretary Mr. F. M. Hodson, who argues that drunkenness is uncommon on the Gold Coast despite the availability of spirits, suggesting an appreciation for temperate habits. Conversely, another article describes a strong movement against the drink traffic, with prominent figures in Lagos expressing concern over alcohol's harmful effects and advocating for its suppression. This indicates a growing awareness and opposition to alcohol's negative impact, suggesting that the influence of imported spirits was indeed a concern. Together, these sources reveal a dual narrative of both temperate habits and active resistance against alcohol's detrimental effects, reflecting a community grappling with the complexities of alcohol consumption and its social implications.

# The introduction of alcohol by European traders has been a significant factor in the decline and degradation of African societies.

The introduction of alcohol by European traders has been a significant factor in the decline and degradation of African societies, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the economic motivations behind the alcohol trade, noting that strong alcoholic drinks, produced cheaply in Europe, were sold for immense profits in Africa, where they became a convenient trade good due to the lack of widely accepted mediums of exchange. This trade had deleterious effects on health and was economically significant, with spirits contributing substantially to government revenue, as seen in the Niger Coast Protectorate's reliance on them for half of its total revenue and 95% of customs duties in 1894. Despite attempts like the Brussels Act of 1892 to limit the trade, its pervasive nature persisted. However, the textbook focuses more on economic and health implications rather than explicitly linking alcohol to broader societal decline. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim by emphasizing the destructive impact of alcohol on African communities. They describe alcohol as a "burning curse," attributing the decline of Coast tribes to the reckless trade, with wages sometimes paid in spirits, leading to widespread drunkenness and unproductivity. The articles cite figures like Mr. Joseph Thomson and Mr. Jas. Irvine, who condemn the gin trade as a greater evil than slavery, noting its role in moral and physical degradation. While Mr. T. C. Rayner offers a contrasting view, arguing that the evils of the liquor traffic are exaggerated and essential for colonial revenue, the overall narrative aligns closely with the claim, highlighting the detrimental effects of alcohol on African societies. This combination of sources underscores the complexity of the issue, with both economic motivations and societal impacts being significant factors in the alcohol trade's legacy in Africa.

# The liquor trade in Africa has caused widespread social and moral decay, rivaling the impact of the slave trade.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the impact of the liquor trade in Africa, particularly in comparison to the slave trade. The textbook acknowledges the negative social impact of the liquor trade, noting the widespread distribution of strong alcoholic drinks, often as wages, which adversely affected health. However, it stops short of equating its effects with the extensive social and moral decay caused by the slave trade, which is described as having a predominantly disruptive character, destroying social and political structures, and causing significant demographic and economic upheaval. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim that the liquor trade has caused widespread social and moral decay, rivaling the impact of the slave trade. The articles describe alcohol as a "burning curse" that has led to the degradation and disappearance of Coast tribes, and they criticize traders for prioritizing profit over the well-being of local populations, drawing parallels to the horrors of the middle passage during the slave trade. The articles highlight the payment of wages in spirits, resulting in rampant drunkenness and unproductivity among native laborers, and explicitly compare the ruin caused by the drink trade to the physical devastation of the slave trade. They also note the pervasive presence of alcohol and the role of the Mohammedan religion in resisting the liquor traffic. Thus, while the textbook does not support the claim that the liquor trade's impact rivals that of the slave trade, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts that align closely with this assertion.

# Efforts to control or restrict the liquor trade in Africa were complicated by international trade dynamics and the presence of multiple colonial powers.

Efforts to control or restrict the liquor trade in Africa were significantly complicated by international trade dynamics and the presence of multiple colonial powers, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details the substantial flow of strong alcoholic drinks into Africa, driven by Europe's ability to produce alcohol cheaply and sell it for immense profits. This trade was further complicated by the lack of widely accepted mediums of exchange in African economies, making alcohol a convenient trade good. The Brussels Act of 1892, which attempted to limit the liquor trade in the Congo, was unsuccessful, highlighting the challenges of regulating such trade amidst international interests. By 1894, a significant portion of government revenue in the Niger Coast Protectorate was derived from the liquor trade, indicating the economic entanglement and reliance on this trade. Similarly, The African Times articles underscore the challenges faced by individual colonial administrations, such as the British, in regulating the liquor trade due to the presence of other European powers like Germany, France, and Portugal. The Chairman's remarks emphasize that if Britain were to unilaterally stop the importation of liquor, the trade would simply shift to neighboring colonies controlled by other nations, leading to a loss of overall trade, not just in liquor but in other goods as well. This underscores the necessity of an international agreement to effectively manage the liquor trade. The articles also mention the Berlin and Brussels conferences, where the issue was discussed, indicating that the international community recognized the problem but struggled to implement effective solutions. Together, these observations illustrate the complexities introduced by competitive colonial interests and the need for a coordinated international approach to address the liquor trade issue in Africa.

# The introduction of European goods, including alcohol, has been more detrimental than beneficial to African societies.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the introduction of European goods, particularly alcohol, has been more detrimental than beneficial to African societies. The textbook highlights the negative impact of the alcohol trade, noting that strong alcoholic drinks were distributed on a large scale, often as wages, which had a deleterious effect on health. Despite attempts like the Brussels Act of 1892 to limit this trade in the Congo, it persisted, causing significant harm. Additionally, the influx of European manufactured goods led to the decline of pre-colonial African industries and crafts, as cheap imports undermined local production and halted technological development until after independence. The focus on cash crops for export, driven by colonial economic policies, resulted in the neglect of food production for local consumption, leading to malnutrition and famine. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the severe impact of the liquor traffic, noting that wages paid in spirits led to widespread drunkenness and unproductivity. The liquor trade is described as a greater evil than slavery, debasing and demoralizing the population, inciting tribal warfare, and hindering the spread of Christianity and legitimate commerce. The Hon. and Rev. J. Johnson argues that European commerce has caused more harm than good, with spirits so vile they are unfit for European consumption, and calls for European governments, particularly England, to intervene. Both sources illustrate the negative consequences of European goods on African societies, particularly through the lens of the alcohol trade, without providing information that refutes the claim, thereby reinforcing the perspective that the introduction of European goods has been largely detrimental.

# The introduction of European alcohol to Africa was seen as a continuation of the destructive legacy of the slave trade.

The claim that the introduction of European alcohol to Africa was seen as a continuation of the destructive legacy of the slave trade is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not explicitly link European alcohol to the continuation of the slave trade's destructive legacy. However, it notes that spirits were among the goods exchanged for slaves, suggesting a potential connection between alcohol and the broader economic and social disruptions caused by the slave trade. The text highlights the negative impacts of the slave trade, such as social and political disruption, economic dislocation, and the undermining of local industries, but does not specifically attribute these effects to the introduction of European alcohol. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim, drawing parallels between the liquor trade and the slave trade. The articles emphasize the detrimental effects of the liquor traffic on African societies, with Mr. Joseph Thomson stating that while the slave trade killed bodies, the drink traffic ruins souls, suggesting a continuation of destruction in a different form. They describe how the liquor trade debases mind and body, exacerbates the miseries of intertribal warfare and the slave trade, and hinders Christian missionary work, essential for the continent's progress. The articles also criticize the Berlin Conference's failure to restrict the liquor trade, likening it to the exploitation of the slave trade era. While the articles do not explicitly state that the liquor trade is a direct continuation of the slave trade, they present it as a parallel form of exploitation and degradation, aligning with the claim. This nuanced difference is significant for historians studying the legacy of European colonialism in Africa.

# The liquor trade in Africa was influenced by low duties in British colonies and duty-free policies in French and German territories.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary insights into the liquor trade in Africa, highlighting its economic significance and the influence of colonial duty policies. The textbook emphasizes the role of alcohol as a major trade item in the colonial economy, noting its profitability due to cheap production in Europe and its use as a form of currency in economies lacking widely accepted mediums of exchange. It underscores the substantial revenue generated for colonial administrations, such as the Niger Coast Protectorate, where spirits were a significant source of government income. However, the textbook does not specifically address the impact of low duties in British colonies or duty-free policies in French and German territories on the liquor trade. In contrast, The African Times articles directly support the claim that these duty policies influenced the trade. They detail how the Royal Niger Company struggled to restrict spirit imports due to low duties in the British colony of Lagos, which facilitated smuggling into other regions like Nupe. The articles also highlight that French and German territories imposed no duties on spirits, complicating efforts to control the trade and suggesting that international cooperation was necessary to manage it effectively. Together, these sources illustrate the economic motivations behind the liquor trade and the significant impact of colonial duty policies on its dynamics in Africa.

# The introduction of intoxicating liquors by British traders had a devastating impact on native populations in British colonies and dependencies.

The introduction of intoxicating liquors by British traders had a significant impact on native populations in British colonies and dependencies, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook notes that the influx of strong alcoholic drinks into Africa had a deleterious effect on health, with spirits often distributed on a large scale, sometimes as wages. While this supports the claim of a negative impact, the textbook does not specifically attribute this introduction solely to British traders, nor does it state that the impact was universally devastating. It also presents a nuanced perspective, referencing Mary Kingsley's view that the trade in spirits was less harmful than cannabis and highlighting the economic benefits, such as governmental revenue in the Niger Coast Protectorate derived from spirits. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly support the claim, emphasizing the severe consequences of the liquor trade, including degradation, misery, and increased mortality rates among native populations. The articles criticize British trade for the widespread availability of intoxicating liquors, which undermines missionary efforts and exacerbates issues like intertribal warfare and the slave trade. They also highlight the broader European complicity in perpetuating this trade, particularly after the Berlin Conference. Together, these sources illustrate a complex picture where the introduction of intoxicating liquors had both detrimental social impacts and economic implications, with varying degrees of responsibility attributed to British traders and European powers.

# The introduction of European alcohol, such as rum and gin, exacerbated existing issues of alcohol abuse among African communities.

The introduction of European alcohol, such as rum and gin, into African communities is a topic explored in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, each providing insights that support the claim that these imports exacerbated existing issues of alcohol abuse. The General History of Africa notes the deleterious health effects of strong European alcoholic drinks, which were produced cheaply and sold for immense profits, becoming significant trade goods in economies lacking widely accepted mediums of exchange. This suggests that European alcohol had a negative impact, although the text does not explicitly confirm that alcohol abuse was a pre-existing issue before European introduction. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a more detailed account, highlighting that African communities already consumed indigenous alcoholic beverages like palm sap and plantain wine. The introduction of stronger European spirits intensified alcohol abuse, leading to widespread drunkenness and destructive impacts on the population, as emphasized by the phrase "HAS DESTROYED ITS MILLIONS." The articles also compare regions with varying alcohol availability, noting that high licensing fees in Senegambia limited access and resulted in a more orderly population, unlike Sierra Leone, where prevalent drink traffic led to suffering. Additionally, a document from the Y.M.C.A. of Abeokuta is cited, arguing that the rum and gin trade was more harmful than the slave trade. Together, these sources illustrate how European alcohol exacerbated existing issues of alcohol abuse in Africa, with The African Times providing a more explicit historical perspective on the matter.

# The presence of European alcohol in Africa led to a preference for Islamic influence over Christian influence in some areas.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the claim that the presence of European alcohol in Africa led to a preference for Islamic influence over Christian influence in some areas. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim. It highlights the detrimental effects of the alcohol trade on African societies, particularly in the Niger Coast Protectorate, and discusses the growth of Islam under colonial rule due to its integration with traditional African practices and its role as resistance against Western domination. However, it does not explicitly link these factors to a preference for Islam over Christianity. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing how European alcohol caused moral and physical ruin among native populations. They note that in places like Lagos and Sierra Leone, Christians were contributing to mosque construction due to despair over alcohol-related issues, while Islam's prohibition of intoxicants offered a more appealing alternative. The articles further mention that Islam's spread brought a sanitary code and prohibition on strong drink, suggesting that Islamic influence was seen as beneficial compared to the destructive impact of European alcohol. These observations from The African Times suggest a correlation between the presence of European alcohol and a shift in preference towards Islamic practices in certain African regions, a connection not addressed in the textbook.

# The King's change of heart towards the English may indicate a shift in political or economic priorities within the Kingdom of Abomey.

The observations from the General History of Africa and The African Times provide complementary insights into the claim regarding a potential shift in political or economic priorities within the Kingdom of Abomey, specifically in relation to the English. The General History of Africa does not directly address a change of heart by the King of Abomey towards the English, nor does it explicitly discuss a shift in political or economic priorities concerning them. However, it does highlight King Gezo of Dahomey's economic policies, particularly his response to the European anti-slave trade movement, by continuing the slave trade with Portuguese dealers while expanding the palm oil trade. This indicates an adaptation to changing economic conditions, suggesting a broader economic transition from reliance solely on the slave trade to incorporating legitimate trade, such as palm oil. In contrast, The African Times suggests a change in the King's attitude towards the English, as he expresses a desire to receive a British commissioner and renew friendly relations with England. This shift could indicate a change in political or economic priorities, as the King seeks to re-establish previously strained connections. The article hints at strategic motivations, such as leveraging existing relationships by involving Mr. Freeman, a former General Superintendent of the Wesleyan Mission, but does not provide concrete evidence of specific priorities driving this change. The lack of explicit reasons for the King's change of heart presents an intriguing point for further investigation, leaving open questions about the underlying motivations. Together, these sources highlight a complex interplay of economic adaptation and potential political realignment within the Kingdom of Abomey, though they do not definitively confirm the claim.

# The Supreme Court order at Cape Coast requiring certificates for legal practice suggests an attempt to regulate and control the legal profession, potentially limiting independence.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news article present contrasting perspectives on the claim regarding the Supreme Court order at Cape Coast requiring certificates for legal practice. The textbook does not directly address this specific claim, focusing instead on broader aspects of legal and judicial systems in Africa during the colonial period, such as the introduction of European judicial institutions and the imposition of British law in the Gold Coast. It lacks any mention of a Supreme Court order at Cape Coast or regulations requiring certificates for legal practice, highlighting a gap in historical documentation on this issue. In contrast, The African Times article provides detailed support for the claim, citing an order dated April 25, 1864, which mandates that no person can plead in the principal courts without a certificate from the chief justice, accompanied by an annual fee of five guineas. This regulation suggests an attempt to control the legal profession by imposing financial and administrative barriers, potentially limiting the independence of legal practitioners. The article further notes that certificates can be suspended for reasons deemed sufficient by the judge, indicating a mechanism for control over who can practice law. This aligns with the claim that the order aims to regulate and control the legal profession, possibly at the expense of independence, and the article does not provide any information that refutes this interpretation. Together, these sources highlight a discrepancy in historical records and underscore the potential impact of the order on the independence of legal practitioners in colonial Cape Coast.

# The restoration of a popular ruler in Sierra Leone was seen as a corrective measure to address the injustices experienced under previous governance.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer contrasting perspectives on the claim regarding the restoration of a popular ruler in Sierra Leone as a corrective measure for past injustices. The textbook does not directly address this claim, focusing instead on the abolitionist movement, the return of liberated slaves, modernization, and socio-political developments, including the role of missionaries and colonial governance. It highlights the challenges faced by settlers and the evolution of governance structures but lacks specific references to the restoration of a ruler to address governance injustices. In contrast, The African Times article supports the claim by criticizing the rule of ex-Governor Blackall, who undermined civil rights by abolishing trial by jury and appointing controversial judicial figures. The article notes that his governance attracted attention from the English Parliament, indicating a recognized need for reform. It expresses optimism about the newly-appointed Governor-in-Chief, emphasizing the task of restoring popular rights and ruling for the public good, aligning with the claim of rectifying past injustices. However, the article does not specify the identity of the restored ruler or the exact measures they would implement, which could be of interest to historians studying the period.

# The mourning of Alfred Pratt by numerous friends in England indicates the existence of cross-cultural relationships and networks between Africans and Europeans during this period.

The claim that the mourning of Alfred Pratt by numerous friends in England indicates the existence of cross-cultural relationships and networks between Africans and Europeans during this period is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides a broad overview of African-European interactions from the fifteenth century onwards, highlighting the roles Africans played in European societies, such as in domestic service, maritime occupations, and as students. It emphasizes cultural exchanges and the influence of African diaspora communities in Europe, although it does not specifically mention Alfred Pratt or his mourning, focusing instead on general patterns rather than individual cases. In contrast, The African Times article provides specific evidence supporting the claim, noting that Alfred Pratt, an African medical student at King's College in England, was highly regarded by his tutors and loved by his fellow collegians, indicating his acceptance and integration within the academic community. The mourning of his death by numerous friends in England suggests he had established meaningful relationships beyond his immediate cultural background. Additionally, the involvement of Rev. Henry Johnson, associated with the Church Missionary Society, highlights existing networks between Africans and Europeans, particularly in religious and educational contexts. Together, these sources illustrate the presence of cross-cultural interactions and relationships during this period, with The African Times providing a specific instance that complements the broader patterns described in the General History of Africa.

# Alfred Pratt's burial in Highgate Cemetery alongside family members suggests the establishment of African diaspora communities in England during the 19th century.

The General History of Africa textbook provides a comprehensive overview of the African diaspora in Europe, particularly in Western Europe, from the fifteenth century onwards, highlighting the presence of Africans in countries like Spain, Portugal, France, and Britain. By the mid-eighteenth century, a significant number of free Africans resided in these regions, often concentrated in port towns and involved in occupations such as domestic service and maritime roles. However, the textbook does not specifically mention Alfred Pratt or his burial in Highgate Cemetery, nor does it provide direct evidence of African diaspora communities being established in England during the 19th century through burial practices. It discusses the broader presence and integration of Africans in European societies, which could indirectly support the notion of diaspora communities forming, but lacks specific details about burial practices or family establishments in England. In contrast, The African Times article confirms that Alfred Pratt was buried in Highgate Cemetery in a family grave, where a beloved sister had been previously interred, suggesting a familial presence in England that could indicate the beginnings of an African diaspora community. While the article focuses on Pratt's personal achievements, his untimely death, and the mourning of his loss by friends and family, it does not explicitly mention the establishment of broader African diaspora communities in England during the 19th century. The presence of a family grave implies some level of settlement or connection to England, but the article does not provide further context or evidence of a larger African diaspora community, highlighting a notable difference from the claim.

# The British saw the potential for Lagos to become a center of Christian influence and civilization in West Africa.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the claim that the British saw the potential for Lagos to become a center of Christian influence and civilization in West Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of the Breadfruit Church in Lagos and the involvement of missionaries like James Johnson, who advocated for Nigerian nationalism and Ethiopianism. The presence of various missionary activities, including the construction of churches and schools, underscores efforts to spread Christianity and European education. Additionally, the settlement of Afro-Brazilians in Lagos, who contributed to the religious and cultural landscape by building churches and participating in missionary schools, suggests that Lagos was seen as a strategic location for promoting Christian influence. However, the text does not explicitly state that the British had a specific vision for Lagos as a Christian center, focusing more on broader missionary and colonial activities. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a more direct support for the claim, expressing a clear desire for the spread of Christian civilization and highlighting the perceived obstacle of Fetish worship under ex-King Docemo's patronage. The articles suggest that the British Government might need to intervene to remove these influences, indicating a belief in the transformative power of Christian civilization. The mention of Rev. James Johnson and the anticipation of Lagos's new importance in spreading "good tidings" further align with the claim. Collectively, these details suggest that while the General History of Africa provides context for missionary activities, The African Times explicitly supports the notion that the British saw Lagos as having significant potential to become a hub of Christian influence and civilization in the region.

# The establishment of the Pastorate Institution in Lagos was seen as timely and indicative of its potential for growth and consolidation.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about the establishment of the Pastorate Institution in Lagos or its perceived timeliness and potential for growth and consolidation. While it discusses various religious and educational developments in Lagos, such as the establishment of churches, schools, and the influence of different missionary societies, as well as the cultural and religious dynamics including the formation of the United Native African Church and the role of Afro-Brazilians, it notably lacks any direct reference to the Pastorate Institution or an assessment of its growth potential. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide details that support the claim regarding the establishment of the Pastorate Institution in Lagos. They mention a motion moved by Mr. John A. Payne and seconded by the Rev. T. B. Wright, which expresses a "humble belief" in the "seasonableness" of the institution's establishment, indicating that the timing was considered appropriate. The motion also highlights the "steady growth and gradual consolidation" of the institution, aligning with the claim of its potential for growth and consolidation. These details suggest that the establishment was viewed positively and with optimism for its future development, supporting the claim made about the Pastorate Institution in Lagos.

# The incident involving the Baptist messenger suggests that even those who were victims of slavery could perpetuate the system, complicating narratives of victimhood and agency.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news article provide a nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding victimhood and agency in the context of slavery. The textbook highlights the role of African distributors in the slave trade, driven by economic necessity, which suggests a level of agency and complicity that complicates the narrative of pure victimhood. It mentions figures like Tippu Tip and Rabeh, who consolidated power through the slave trade, illustrating how some Africans navigated and even benefited from the system. Additionally, African slave-traders' opposition to the suppression of the trade to avoid commercial chaos further supports the idea that those involved were not merely victims but active participants with agency. However, the textbook does not specifically mention an incident involving a Baptist messenger. In contrast, The African Times article recounts the story of a native Christian man of the Baptist persuasion, initially a victim of slavery, who later betrayed two escaping slaves, leading to their capture. This incident underscores the complexity of individual actions within the slavery context, where a former victim actively perpetuated the system. Together, these sources illustrate how narratives of victimhood and agency are complicated by the roles individuals played within the system, reinforcing the claim that the dynamics of slavery were multifaceted and not solely defined by clear-cut roles of victim and oppressor.

# Educational opportunities for Africans were expanding during this period, as evidenced by individuals like Mr. Isaac Oluwole, who studied in England and returned to contribute to local education.

The claim that educational opportunities for Africans were expanding during this period is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the emergence of an educated elite in Africa, facilitated by missionary and local initiatives, with individuals studying abroad and returning to contribute to local education and society. It provides examples such as James Africanus Horton and Samuel Ajayi Crowther, who studied in Britain and played significant roles in West Africa, as well as the influence of American education on Africans like Nnamdi Azikiwe and John Dube, who returned to establish educational institutions. However, the textbook does not specifically mention Mr. Isaac Oluwole. In contrast, The African Times specifically mentions Mr. Isaac Oluwole, who studied at Durham University in England after attending Fourah Bay in Sierra Leone, and returned to Lagos to serve as the Principal of the Lagos Grammar School. This example underscores the opportunity for Africans to pursue higher education abroad and contribute to local educational development. While the textbook provides a broader context of educational expansion, the news article offers a specific instance with Mr. Oluwole, collectively supporting the claim of expanding educational opportunities for Africans during this period.

# The involvement of European companies in African trade often led to legal and financial conflicts, indicating a complex and possibly exploitative economic environment.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the involvement of European companies in African trade often led to legal and financial conflicts, indicating a complex and possibly exploitative economic environment. The textbook highlights the exploitative tendencies of European commercial firms, which appropriated surplus from African peasant production through unequal exchange, paying little for produce and charging high prices for imported goods. It discusses the manipulation of African rulers by European traders, who used free trade as a slogan to gain control over African economies, leading to one-sided agreements and international debt commissions that undermined the autonomy of African rulers. European firms monopolized trade, set prices, and controlled marketing mechanisms, disadvantaging African peasants and smallholders. The colonial system's exploitation of African labor and resources, coupled with racial prejudice and the lack of access to financial resources for African businessmen, further illustrates the complex and exploitative economic environment. Complementing this, The African Times articles mention Mr. Forsythe's trial for embezzlement, brought by Messrs. Sykes and Mather of Manchester, suggesting a legal conflict involving European entities. Additionally, a dispute between the prosecutors and the Central African Company resulted in a financial settlement, indicating a complex economic environment with frequent disputes and charges related to mercantile business on the West Coast of Africa. While the articles highlight these constant disputes, they do not provide explicit details on the nature of the exploitation or the broader economic impact, which the textbook addresses more comprehensively. Together, these sources underscore the legal and financial conflicts arising from European involvement in African trade.

# The narrator's experience suggests that personal appearance and social charm were valued traits that could influence one's social standing and opportunities.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that personal appearance and social charm were valued traits influencing social standing and opportunities. The General History of Africa does not explicitly address this claim, focusing instead on literacy, education, and skills as key determinants of social mobility and status in colonial Africa. It highlights the importance of wealth, particularly through ownership of slaves and property, and the influence of European cultural models on returning liberated slaves, suggesting that cultural assimilation and Western lifestyle adoption could impact social opportunities. While personal appearance and social charm are not directly mentioned, the emphasis on education, literacy, and cultural adaptation implies that these traits may have played an indirect role in social interactions and opportunities. In contrast, The African Times article provides direct support for the claim, with the narrator's experience underscoring the significance of personal appearance and social charm. The narrator's awareness of their attractiveness and efforts to maintain a clean, clerical appearance, along with their ability to form influential social connections, highlight the value placed on grooming and social skills. Despite setbacks, the narrator's success in leveraging their speech and writing abilities to secure a lucrative position and leadership role further illustrates the impact of social charm on social standing. Together, these observations suggest that while the textbook emphasizes structural factors, the article highlights the personal traits that could also shape social opportunities.

# The British believed that Boer actions in Zululand could provoke a widespread native uprising, which would ultimately be detrimental to the Boers themselves.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times articles provide complementary perspectives on the claim that the British believed Boer actions in Zululand could provoke a widespread native uprising, ultimately detrimental to the Boers themselves. The General History of Africa does not explicitly support or refute this claim but highlights British concerns about potential African uprisings and the strategic importance of controlling African states, particularly the Zulu kingdom. The British were wary of alliances between African groups, such as the Hlubi, Sotho, Ndebele, and Zulu, which could threaten white settlers, and sought to manage tensions between the Boers and African states to maintain stability and protect their interests. While the textbook does not directly link Boer actions in Zululand to fears of a native uprising, it suggests that the British were concerned about the broader implications of unrest in the region, focusing more on strategic interests and control. In contrast, The African Times article explicitly supports the claim, detailing that the British believed Boer interference in Zululand's politics could lead to a "general Caffre rising in South Africa," posing significant risks to the Boers. The article indicates that such an uprising would be dangerous for the Boers, who would have "by far the greatest cause to rue the day," and highlights British concerns over maintaining order and security in the Reserve to prevent such an uprising. Although the article does not explicitly state that the British believed the uprising would be widespread, it implies significant concern over the potential consequences of Boer actions, aligning with the claim by emphasizing the risks and potential negative outcomes for the Boers due to their involvement in Zululand.

# The Earl's ability to identify and address abuses indicates a proactive approach to social justice that may have influenced British policies in Africa.

The claim that an Earl's ability to identify and address abuses indicates a proactive approach to social justice that may have influenced British policies in Africa is not directly supported by the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook primarily discusses British activities related to the abolition of the slave trade, the establishment of colonial rule, and the impact of European presence on African societies, focusing on the roles of British consuls, traders, and missionaries. These activities, while potentially addressing certain social issues, are not explicitly linked to an Earl's proactive approach to social justice. In contrast, The African Times article highlights the Earl of Shaftesbury's proactive approach to social justice, noting his influence in passing laws to improve conditions for the poorest and most overworked individuals in factories and mines, and his involvement with the Church Missionary Society. This demonstrates his commitment to social reform and a broader interest in global issues, including those in Africa. However, the article does not provide specific details about his influence on British policies in Africa, focusing instead on his general advocacy for oppressed peoples. Thus, while the Earl's efforts were widespread, neither source explicitly connects them to policy changes in Africa, marking a notable difference in content.

# Efforts were made by individuals in Britain to raise awareness about the negative impacts of alcohol trade in African colonies.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide contrasting perspectives on the claim that efforts were made by individuals in Britain to raise awareness about the negative impacts of the alcohol trade in African colonies. The General History of Africa does not offer specific details or evidence supporting the claim, focusing instead on the deleterious effects of the alcohol trade on health in Africa, the immense profits from selling cheap European alcohol, and its widespread distribution, often as wages. It highlights the economic motivations behind the trade and the challenges in regulating it, such as the unsuccessful attempts to limit the trade in the Congo through the Brussels Act of 1892, without mentioning any particular efforts by British individuals to address these negative impacts. In contrast, The African Times provides evidence supporting the claim, describing a meeting held on May 18 in the Town Hall, Manchester, aimed at raising public awareness about the evils of the drink traffic in Africa and other colonies. The event's significance is underscored by the presence of notable figures such as the Dean of Manchester, the Hon. and Rev. James Johnson (a native minister of Lagos), and Mr. Joseph Thomson (a well-known African traveler), highlighting the involvement of both British and African representatives in these awareness efforts. This specific instance aligns with the claim, demonstrating active engagement by individuals in Britain to raise awareness about the negative impacts of the alcohol trade in African colonies.

# The comparison between German and English territorial agreements in East Africa suggests a competitive dynamic between European powers in their colonial pursuits on the continent.

The comparison between German and English territorial agreements in East Africa suggests a competitive dynamic between European powers in their colonial pursuits on the continent, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the Anglo-German delimitation treaty of 1886 and the Heligoland Treaty of 1890, which illustrate the partitioning of East Africa into spheres of influence and the strategic negotiations between Britain and Germany to limit each other's territorial expansions. These treaties, along with the broader context of the Berlin Conference of 1884, underscore the competitive nature of European imperialism in Africa. Complementing this, The African Times articles detail the Sultan of Zanzibar's abdication of rights in favor of the German East African Company, granting them control similar to that of the English East African Company over a coastal strip in the English sphere. This parallel in territorial agreements suggests a rivalry in expanding influence, further emphasized by the German achievement of the first ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro within their protectorate. While the articles do not explicitly mention direct conflict, the similarities in agreements and achievements imply an underlying competitive dynamic between Germany and England in their colonial endeavors in East Africa.

# His efforts in promoting education and literacy, particularly in the Yoruba language, contributed to cultural and religious development in the region.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary insights into the promotion of education and literacy in West Africa, particularly through the efforts of figures like Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther and Reverend James Johnson. The textbook highlights the broader impact of education and literacy through missionary activities and the return of liberated Africans, who played a critical role in modernization and the formation of an educated elite. However, it does not specifically mention efforts in promoting the Yoruba language or directly link these efforts to cultural and religious development in the region. In contrast, The African Times article specifically supports the claim regarding James Johnson's efforts in promoting education and literacy in the Yoruba language, contributing to cultural and religious development. The article emphasizes Johnson's initiative to learn and preach in Yoruba, highlighting the value of reading and writing in the language, and his role in organizing plans for his church at St. Paul's, Breadfruit, Lagos, which underscores his contribution to religious development. While the article does not explicitly mention broader cultural development beyond the religious context, it provides evidence of Johnson's influence in education and literacy within the religious sphere, particularly through his work with the Yoruba language. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted efforts in promoting education and literacy in the region, with a specific emphasis on the Yoruba language in Johnson's case.

# Johnson's influence extended beyond the church, as he was involved in political matters, evidenced by his nomination to the Legislative Council in Lagos.

The claim that Johnson's influence extended beyond the church into political matters is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with differing emphases. The General History of Africa textbook highlights James Johnson's significant role in advocating Nigerian nationalism and Ethiopianism, as well as his involvement with the Church Missionary Society and his push for an independent African Church. However, it does not mention any political involvement, such as a nomination to the Legislative Council in Lagos, focusing instead on his religious and cultural influence. In contrast, The African Times provides details that directly support the claim of Johnson's political engagement. The article notes that Administrator (now Governor) Moloney nominated him to the Legislative Council in Lagos, earning him the title of "Honourable" and indicating his active participation in political affairs. Furthermore, it mentions his role as a spokesman for a deputation on "Education" that met with the Governor, underscoring his involvement in civic matters. These details from The African Times corroborate the claim that Johnson's influence was not limited to religious circles but also extended into the political realm.

# His life and work were celebrated by people of high distinction, highlighting his devotion to his country and humanity.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that an individual's life and work were celebrated by people of high distinction, highlighting their devotion to their country and humanity. The "General History of Africa" does not directly address this claim, as it focuses on the historical impact and ideological contributions of figures like Blaise Diagne, Shaykh Rifa'a al-Tahtâwï, and Edward Wilmot Blyden, without explicitly mentioning any personal accolades or recognition by distinguished contemporaries. In contrast, The African Times article supports the claim by highlighting Rev. James Johnson's life and work, noting "testimonials from persons of the highest distinction" as evidence of his integrity, courage, and devotion to his country. The article emphasizes his leadership and authority in the ministry, as well as his exemplary manhood and dedication to humanity, aligning with the assertion that his contributions were recognized by notable individuals. Thus, while the textbook provides a broader historical context without specific mention of personal celebrations, the news article offers direct support for the claim through documented recognition by distinguished individuals.

# The focus on promoting the study of the Hausa language suggests a recognition of the importance of indigenous languages in missionary and colonial efforts.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the focus on promoting the study of the Hausa language suggests a recognition of the importance of indigenous languages in missionary and colonial efforts. The textbook highlights the increasing use of Hausa over Arabic or Fulfulde in books and poetry, indicating a shift towards using a more accessible language for a wider audience, which suggests an acknowledgment of the practical value of indigenous languages in reaching local populations. However, it also notes the colonial preference for European languages as lingua franca, exemplified by the British East Africa case where Swahili was not developed as a lingua franca due to colonial policy favoring English. This reflects a tension between recognizing indigenous languages and imposing colonial languages, with the focus on Hausa in intellectual and religious activities suggesting some recognition, yet broader colonial policies often undermined the development of indigenous languages. Meanwhile, The African Times article supports the claim by mentioning the formation of an association in memory of Rev. John Alfred Robinson, aimed at promoting the study of Hausa, indicating an acknowledgment of the importance of engaging with local languages for effective communication and missionary work. However, the article emphasizes the missionary aspect without explicitly discussing the broader colonial context. Together, these sources illustrate a complex and sometimes contradictory approach to indigenous languages, with both missionary and colonial efforts recognizing their importance to varying degrees.

# The ceremony highlighted the importance of maintaining a Christianity that is deeply rooted in its spiritual origins, rather than a superficial practice.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news article collectively underscore the importance of maintaining a Christianity deeply rooted in its spiritual origins, rather than a superficial practice. The textbook provides a nuanced view of how Christianity has been adapted and integrated within African contexts, highlighting the emergence of indigenous Christian movements that sought to root Christianity in African cultural and spiritual traditions. These movements, such as the Musama Disco Christo Church, were not merely superficial adaptations but expressions of religious creativity and cultural integrity, aiming to offer solutions beneficial to their communities. However, the text also contrasts this with instances where Christianity was practiced superficially, as seen in the case of Afro-Brazilians who maintained traditional beliefs alongside Catholicism for social status rather than spiritual depth. This duality reflects both support and refutation of the claim, illustrating the complexity of Christianity's integration into African societies. Complementing this, The African Times article details Mr. J. A. Otonba Payne's address at the foundation-stone laying ceremony of the Lagos Native Baptist Church, where he warned against a form of Christianity "without Christ," likening it to "a stream without a fountain—a branch without a root—a body without a soul." Payne's metaphor underscores the necessity of a genuine and spiritually grounded practice of Christianity, aligning with the claim's emphasis on avoiding superficial religious practices. His reference to the evangelization of Africa through its own sons, such as the late Rev. James White and Rev. J. M. Harden, further emphasizes the importance of an authentic and indigenous approach to Christianity, rooted in the local context and spiritual heritage. Together, these observations highlight the critical need for a Christianity that resonates deeply with its spiritual origins and cultural identity.

# The granting of charters to companies by governments in Africa often led to the exploitation and oppression of native populations due to inadequate oversight and control.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the granting of charters to companies by governments in Africa often led to the exploitation and oppression of native populations due to inadequate oversight and control. The General History of Africa highlights how colonial administrations systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from their mineral resources, granting monopolies to imperialist interests like the Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) and the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), which were given exclusive rights to exploit resources. This exclusion, justified under the guise of market control, was a means to appease international capital pressures, thereby oppressing local populations. The text also underscores the use of forced labor and tax impositions to integrate Africans into European economic enterprises, illustrating the exploitation facilitated by colonial policies. The indirect rule system, which relied on indigenous personnel in subordinate roles, often lacked adequate oversight, further leading to exploitation. However, the text does not explicitly identify the granting of charters as the primary cause of exploitation, suggesting it was part of a broader colonial oppression system. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the significant responsibility of governments in selecting appropriate individuals for charters, highlighting the potential for misuse if powers are granted to unfit persons, aligning with the claim of inadequate oversight. The articles discuss the heavy responsibility on shareholders and officials of chartered companies to protect the rights and freedoms of those they govern, suggesting that failure to do so could lead to oppression. They mention native races being placed under rule without consultation and lacking means to address grievances, supporting the claim of exploitation and oppression. However, the articles focus more on responsibilities and potential consequences rather than documented outcomes, suggesting a theoretical rather than empirical perspective. Together, these sources illustrate the complex interplay of inadequate oversight and systemic colonial practices in facilitating exploitation and oppression in Africa.

# The merging of governing and trading functions in colonial enterprises often led to injustice and exploitation of the local population.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the merging of governing and trading functions in colonial enterprises often led to injustice and exploitation of the local population. The textbook highlights how colonial administrators and commercial entities, such as mining firms and banks, collaborated to advance the interests of the colonizers, resulting in forced labor, land appropriation, and the imposition of taxes and compulsory cultivation. These actions disrupted pre-colonial cultures and economies, with economic policies like tying local currencies to those of colonial powers further entrenching exploitation. The manipulation of colonial judicial systems and labor codes to favor European settlers underscores the systemic nature of this exploitation. Similarly, The African Times articles echo these concerns, with Commander Cameron explicitly arguing against the combination of governing and trading powers, citing historical instances where such arrangements prioritized shareholder interests over those of the governed. The articles also discuss the Niger Company's trade monopoly, which stifled competition and disadvantaged native traders, and the fears that the African Association's similar pursuits would further harm local commerce. The memorial from Lagos inhabitants advocates for free commerce as essential for fair development, opposing monopolistic control by trading companies. Together, these sources illustrate how the intertwining of governance and commerce in colonial enterprises facilitated systemic exploitation and injustice against Africans, hindering fair trade and development.

# The suppression of Mr. Payne's report by the government suggests manipulation of information to control narratives and influence decisions by colonial authorities.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the suppression of Mr. Payne's report by the government suggests manipulation of information to control narratives and influence decisions by colonial authorities. The General History of Africa provides a broader context, detailing various instances where colonial regimes employed censorship, informers, and secret police to suppress opposition and control information. It highlights the manipulation of traditional leadership structures and the use of propaganda, sedition laws, and repressive measures against nationalist movements to maintain control over colonized populations. However, it does not specifically mention Mr. Payne's report, indicating a gap in directly addressing this particular instance. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details about Mr. Payne's mission to the King of Jebu, which successfully settled differences between the Egbas, Ibadan, and Oyo, leading to the resumption of trade. Despite this success, Captain Glover declared the mission a failure because it contradicted his interests, and the report was suppressed at Government-house, allowing Glover to present a narrative of his choosing to the Secretary of State. This specific example from The African Times aligns with the broader patterns of information manipulation described in the General History of Africa, reinforcing the notion of colonial authorities controlling narratives to influence decision-making.

# The historical narratives of the Ibadan and Egba peoples have been affected by external interpretations, potentially leading to misunderstandings or misrepresentations of their past.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveal a lack of specific information regarding the claim that the historical narratives of the Ibadan and Egba peoples have been affected by external interpretations, potentially leading to misunderstandings or misrepresentations of their past. The textbook discusses broader themes of cultural resilience and adaptation in Africa during periods of external domination, such as colonialism and the slave trade, highlighting the influence of European and Arabic expansionism and the resilience of African cultures. However, it does not specifically address the Ibadan and Egba peoples or how their narratives might have been misunderstood or misrepresented. Similarly, The African Times articles do not provide specific information or details that directly support or refute the claim. The repetition of titles suggests a focus on remarks made by entities referred to as "Africa" and "Masotemos" concerning the Ibadan and Egba communities, but without additional context, it is unclear if these involve external interpretations affecting their historical narratives. This absence of direct references in both sources is notable, as it suggests that the claim is neither supported nor refuted by the provided content.

# The conflict between the Ibadans and the Egbas was influenced by internal political dynamics and betrayals rather than external provocations.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present differing focuses regarding the conflict between the Ibadans and the Egbas. The textbook does not directly address this specific conflict, nor does it explicitly discuss the internal political dynamics and betrayals that might have influenced it. Instead, it emphasizes broader regional conflicts, political reforms, and the impact of external forces such as the Sokoto Caliphate's expansion and European colonial interventions. While it mentions internal political dynamics and betrayals in other contexts, such as in Yatenga and Asante, these are not directly linked to the Ibadans and Egbas. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed support for the claim that the conflict was influenced by internal political dynamics and betrayals. They highlight internal grievances, misunderstandings, and jealousies between the Egbas and the Ibadans, with specific instances such as the Egbas' betrayal after initially promising to assist the Ibadans against Kurumi. The articles also describe strategic internal moves, like the Egbas closing roads to Ibadan and intercepting powder shipments, while acknowledging some external interactions, such as the involvement of the King of Porto Novo and the King of Jebu. Overall, the articles emphasize internal betrayals and political dynamics as key factors in the conflict, aligning with the claim, whereas the textbook provides a broader regional context without specific reference to the Ibadans and Egbas.

# The British colonial administration in Lagos faced criticism for its dealings with the Egba people, highlighting issues of transparency and questionable practices.

The General History of Africa textbook does not directly address the British colonial administration's dealings with the Egba people in Lagos, nor does it highlight issues of transparency and questionable practices specifically related to this group. Instead, it focuses on broader themes of colonial administration, resistance, and the impact of European powers on various African regions, including Nigeria, mentioning the annexation of Lagos and British interventions in local politics without specifically focusing on the Egba people or criticisms related to their treatment by the British in Lagos. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide details supporting the claim that the British colonial administration in Lagos faced criticism for its dealings with the Egba people, highlighting issues of transparency and questionable practices. The articles express dissatisfaction with the local colonial government's actions, particularly regarding trade restrictions and the imposition of export duties, seen as unjust and detrimental to legitimate commerce. Concerns are raised about the conduct of the Lagos Executive during the siege of Ikorodu, suggesting a lack of clarity and honor in their dealings with the Egbas. Criticism extends to Captain Glover's administration, described as having squandered resources and pursued an offensive and contemptuous policy, leading to financial difficulties for Lagos. The articles call for a clear and just British policy towards Lagos, emphasizing the need for a wise and conciliatory administration to foster peaceful relations and industrial development. This contrast between the two sources highlights the absence of specific coverage in the textbook and the detailed critique found in the news articles.

# The British influence in West Africa was seen as a civilizing force, but it required local collaboration for effective development.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the claim that British influence in West Africa was seen as a civilizing force requiring local collaboration for effective development. The General History of Africa acknowledges that British colonial policy, particularly through indirect rule, involved collaboration with local African authorities, indicating a reliance on local structures for governance. This aligns with the claim that local collaboration was necessary. However, the text also highlights the imposition of illiberal racial policies and obstacles to African participation in education and commerce, contradicting the notion of a purely civilizing mission. It emphasizes that British interests were primarily economic, driven by the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade, rather than altruistic civilizing intentions. Additionally, the resistance and varied responses of African rulers to British influence suggest that collaboration was not universally accepted or seen as beneficial. Similarly, The African Times articles express a desire for the development of African resources and the spread of enlightenment and civilization, aligning with the notion of British influence as a civilizing force. They emphasize the importance of cooperation with local authorities, particularly in places like Abeokuta, as crucial for progress, supporting the claim of necessary local collaboration. However, the articles also highlight issues such as disorder and neglect in certain regions, suggesting that British influence was not uniformly effective or welcomed. Overall, both sources reflect the perceived civilizing mission of the British and the essential role of local collaboration, while acknowledging the complexities, challenges, and often contentious nature of the British presence in West Africa.

# Abeokuta's strategic importance and potential for prosperity were linked to its natural resources and industrious people.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary insights into the claim about Abeokuta's strategic importance and potential for prosperity. While the textbook does not directly mention Abeokuta, it discusses broader themes relevant to African regions, such as the impact of trade, natural resources, and the industriousness of local populations on economic and social structures. These themes suggest that regions with access to trade routes, natural resources, and skilled labor could experience economic growth, indirectly relating to Abeokuta's potential for prosperity. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim, highlighting Abeokuta as a significant town on the West Coast of Africa with an industrious and intelligent population inclined towards agriculture and trade. The articles emphasize Abeokuta's role as an "industrial key" to the interior regions, underscoring its strategic importance in accessing and developing African resources. They also mention Abeokuta's connection to the sea-port of Lagos, further supporting its strategic significance. However, the articles do not specify particular natural resources, which could be seen as a difference from the claim if one were expecting detailed descriptions. Overall, the articles corroborate the claim by emphasizing the industrious character of the people and the town's strategic position, while the textbook provides a broader context for understanding the factors contributing to regional prosperity.

# The British government's policy in Lagos needed a shift towards a more conciliatory and just administration to foster peace and development.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the British government's policy in Lagos, highlighting the need for a shift towards a more conciliatory and just administration to foster peace and development. The General History of Africa describes the British colonial approach, particularly through indirect rule, which involved cooperation with existing African authorities, suggesting a conciliatory aspect. However, it also notes instances of military confrontation and coercive strategies, such as the annexation of Lagos in 1861 and the use of gunboat diplomacy, which contradict a consistently conciliatory approach. The British efforts to abolish the slave trade and establish legitimate trade led to treaties that eroded local sovereignty, indicating a complex interplay between conciliation and coercion. Meanwhile, The African Times articles criticize Captain Glover's administration as "crooked, aggressive, and offensively contemptuous," leading to financial mismanagement and strained local relations. The articles advocate for a shift towards a "wise, just, firm, and conciliatory Administration," emphasizing the need for policies that promote industrial development and peaceful relations. The appointment of Captain Strachan is seen as a positive step, but the call for a dignified British policy underscores the necessity for a more constructive approach. Together, these sources illustrate the complexity and contradictions in British policy, underscoring the need for a more conciliatory and just administration to achieve peace and development in Lagos.

# The prosperity of Lagos and its surrounding regions depended on maintaining peace and security among neighboring groups, highlighting the interconnectedness of trade and political stability.

The prosperity of Lagos and its surrounding regions has historically depended on maintaining peace and security among neighboring groups, highlighting the interconnectedness of trade and political stability. Insights from the General History of Africa textbook align with this claim by emphasizing the economic advantages conferred on coastal regions like Lagos during the transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade. The growth of European interest and the establishment of coastal towns as political capitals further underscore the link between trade and political stability. The textbook also notes the impact of nineteenth-century wars in Yorubaland, which made coastal areas safer and more attractive for migration, suggesting that peace was crucial for economic prosperity. While the textbook provides a broader regional context, The African Times news articles focus specifically on Lagos, describing it as a commercial hub akin to the "Liverpool of Western Africa." The articles stress the necessity of uninterrupted security for trading operations, particularly between the Ibadans and Egbas, and advocate for reconciliation and enduring friendship to ensure prosperity. They also highlight the strategic importance of Abeokuta as an allied town to Lagos, suggesting improved land communication, such as a railway, to bolster trade and security. Both sources collectively reinforce the idea that the economic growth of Lagos was contingent upon peaceful relations and collaboration with surrounding areas, illustrating the historical perspective that trade and political stability were deeply intertwined.

# The presence of specific African regions such as Lagos, Bonny, and Old Calabar in trade records highlights their importance as centers of commodity production and export.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significance of specific African regions such as Lagos, Bonny, and Old Calabar as pivotal centers of commodity production and export. The General History of Africa highlights Lagos as a crucial coastal town that evolved into a major port and political capital, playing a significant role in trade. It also notes Bonny and Old Calabar as key ports in the slave trade, with Bonny and Calabar continuing to be vital in the export of palm oil and other commodities during the transition to 'legitimate' trade. However, the textbook does not specifically mention Old Calabar in the context of broader commodity production beyond the slave trade. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of these regions' active participation in the palm oil market, with detailed price listings and sales volumes, reinforcing their status as key exporters. Lagos is also noted for its cotton quality, further emphasizing its trade importance. The consistent mention of these regions across different commodities and time periods in the articles aligns with the claim, reinforcing their prominence in historical trade networks. Together, these sources corroborate the claim by highlighting the enduring trade significance of Lagos, Bonny, and Old Calabar.

# The fluctuating prices of palm oil and cotton suggest a dynamic market influenced by supply and demand, possibly affected by external factors such as European industrial needs.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of a dynamic market for palm oil and cotton, influenced by supply and demand and possibly external factors such as European industrial needs. The General History of Africa highlights the transformation of productive structures in West Africa due to the rise of legitimate trade, with palm oil in the Niger delta emerging as a significant product that initially co-existed with the slave trade and later flourished independently. This suggests a market responsive to external demands, particularly from Europe, as evidenced by the increased demand for oil-seeds during the First World War, which led to a temporary production boom. However, the textbook does not explicitly discuss cotton in the context of fluctuating prices or European industrial needs. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence of fluctuating prices for both palm oil and cotton, with palm oil prices varying from 30l. to 39l. per ton and cotton prices ranging from 7d. to 9¾d., indicating a market responsive to changing conditions. The articles describe periods of active demand and price advancements, as well as quieter markets with declining prices, suggesting potential external influences, such as European industrial needs, though these are not explicitly mentioned. Together, these sources underscore the dynamic nature of the palm oil and cotton markets, shaped by supply and demand and possibly external factors, while highlighting a gap in explicit references to European industrial needs in the context of cotton.

# The detailed reporting of commodity prices and sales volumes highlights the integration of African resources into the global economy during the 19th century.

The integration of African resources into the global economy during the 19th century is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, each offering unique insights. The General History of Africa highlights the significant increase in the value of goods passing through Angolan ports and the cash turnover of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino, indicating a growing market economy. It also notes the shift from the slave trade to export-oriented production of commodities like palm oil, groundnuts, and rubber, leading to income redistribution and increased importation of European manufactures, particularly cotton goods. This illustrates Africa's integration into the global economy through commercial unification and expanded trade networks, though it lacks specific details on commodity prices and sales volumes. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed reporting on commodity prices and sales volumes for resources such as camwood, palm kernels, benni-seed, palm oil, and cotton, underscoring the active trade of these commodities in international markets like Liverpool. The articles mention specific price fluctuations and sales volumes, reflecting a well-established trade network and the global economic context, including American cotton prices and exportation figures. However, they do not delve into the broader economic integration or socio-economic impacts on African societies, which are crucial for understanding the full narrative of Africa's integration into the global economy. Together, these sources complement each other by providing both quantitative data and qualitative insights into the integration process.

# The delay and mismanagement of military reinforcements significantly impacted the British campaign against the Ashantee, leading to its premature end for the season.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the British campaign against the Ashantee. The textbook primarily focuses on the historical confrontations between the Asante and the British, detailing specific battles, treaties, and political maneuvers, such as the well-organized and successful campaign led by General Garnet Wolseley in 1874. It does not directly address the claim regarding the delay and mismanagement of military reinforcements impacting the campaign, as it lacks information on logistical issues or reinforcement delays, thus neither supporting nor refuting the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed support for the claim, highlighting the late arrival of the Tamar, expected at the end of February but delayed until April 9th, well into the rainy season. This delay, attributed to possible mismanagement and indecision, significantly impacted the campaign's progress. The articles emphasize that the reinforcements, crucial for advancing 500 men to the Prah, arrived too late, with the swollen Prah River and impassable Ashantee bush further complicating the situation. The lack of adequate preparations for the reinforcements' reception, with some companies left under canvas in the rainy season, contributed to health issues among the troops, leading the Governor to declare the campaign at an end. These details from The African Times align with the claim, illustrating how the delay and mismanagement of reinforcements were pivotal in the campaign's premature conclusion.

# The logistical challenges and health issues faced by British forces highlight the difficulties of colonial military campaigns in Africa during this period.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the logistical challenges and health issues faced by British forces during colonial military campaigns in Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the high death rates among European soldiers due to indigenous diseases, underscoring significant health challenges exacerbated by the late development of medical solutions for tropical diseases. It also describes logistical difficulties, such as the forced recruitment of carriers and labor shortages caused by the influenza epidemic, as well as the necessity of constructing motorable roads to support military operations. Similarly, The African Times articles detail severe health problems, including high rates of sickness and mortality from diseases like fever, dysentery, and scurvy, worsened by poor nourishment and harsh climatic conditions. Logistical issues are further emphasized by the delayed arrival of reinforcements and supplies, such as the late arrival of the Tamar, and inadequate living conditions for troops, including unsanitary quarters and exposure to tropical rains. Both sources highlight the challenges of maintaining communication and supply lines and the need for improved infrastructure, illustrating the multifaceted difficulties British forces encountered during their campaigns in Africa. Together, these observations underscore the complex health and logistical issues that characterized colonial military efforts in the region.

# The high mortality rate among British officers and troops on the Gold Coast was a consequence of the government's lack of foresight and preparation.

The high mortality rate among British officers and troops on the Gold Coast can be attributed to the government's lack of foresight and preparation, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights that Europeans were particularly vulnerable to indigenous diseases in Africa, with significantly higher death rates among British forces compared to African soldiers, indicating inadequate preparation for local health challenges. It notes that Europe was not medically equipped for its African ventures, with limited advancements in tropical disease treatment until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and that real success in reducing mortality rates was only achieved through improved sanitary measures and treatment methods in the early 20th century. The African Times articles further support this claim by detailing the inadequate provisions for troop health, such as insufficient transport, poor accommodations, and unsanitary living conditions, which exacerbated the prevalence of diseases like dysentery and fever. The articles criticize the government's neglect and lack of proper sanitary measures, as well as the absence of telegraphic communication during the threat of war with Ashanti. Although some officials, like Lieut.-Colonel Conran, attempted to propose solutions, such as relocating to healthier climates, they were not supported by civil authorities, highlighting a complex interplay of responsibility. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view that underscores the government's lack of foresight and preparation as a significant factor in the high mortality rate among British forces on the Gold Coast.

# The prevalence of diseases like dysentery, diarrhoea, rheumatism, and fever among troops highlights the inadequate living conditions and medical care in African military camps.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the claim regarding the prevalence of diseases like dysentery, diarrhoea, rheumatism, and fever among troops, highlighting inadequate living conditions and medical care in African military camps. The General History of Africa textbook provides a broader context, noting high mortality rates among laborers due to exposure to new diseases, unsanitary conditions, and inadequate diets, which reflect poor living conditions. It also discusses the spread of diseases such as dysentery and diarrhoea in work camps, alongside a lack of medical resources and personnel, with a low ratio of doctors to the population and insufficient medical facilities for Africans compared to Europeans. Although the text does not specifically mention rheumatism or fever among troops, nor directly address military camps, it paints a picture of general health conditions that likely contributed to disease spread among soldiers. In contrast, The African Times articles offer more direct evidence, reporting a high incidence of sickness among soldiers at locations like Prahsoo and Cape Coast, with acute dysentery, diarrhoea, and fever being particularly common. The articles attribute these health issues to poor nourishment, degenerated constitutions, inadequate protection against tropical rains, and unsanitary living conditions, such as tents on the seaboard and dirty towns with overflowing cesspools. They also highlight the lack of sufficient medical supplies, like quinine, and the overwhelming number of patients in hospitals, described as being full to suffocation. Together, these sources illustrate the challenging living conditions and insufficient medical care faced by troops in African military camps during this period.

# The harsh climate and diseases of the West Coast of Africa, such as malaria and dysentery, significantly impacted British troops during the Ashanti Expedition.

The claim that the harsh climate and diseases of the West Coast of Africa, such as malaria and dysentery, significantly impacted British troops during the Ashanti Expedition is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides context by noting that European forces, including the British, were severely affected by indigenous diseases in West Africa, with European soldiers experiencing much higher death rates than their African counterparts. This suggests that diseases like malaria and dysentery could have impacted British troops during their expeditions, including the Ashanti Expedition, although the textbook does not specifically mention this campaign. In contrast, The African Times offers substantial evidence directly linking the harsh climate and diseases to the British troops' experiences during the Ashanti Expedition. The articles detail high rates of sickness and mortality, with specific references to diseases such as dysentery and fever. For example, one article reports that out of 200 men, 103 were hospitalized, and the hospitals were overwhelmed, indicating the severe impact of disease. Additionally, the articles highlight the death of Captain the Hon. Mr. Charteris from fever and the significant number of officers and men invalided home due to illness. They also discuss inadequate living conditions, such as troops living in tents during tropical rains and being quartered in unsanitary towns, which likely exacerbated disease spread. The death of Prince Henry of Battenberg from African fever further underscores the lethal nature of the climate and diseases. Together, these sources illustrate the detrimental effects of the West African environment on British military personnel during the expedition.

# The presence and challenges faced by missionaries in Africa during the colonial period.

The presence and challenges faced by missionaries in Africa during the colonial period are well-documented in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a comprehensive overview, noting that missionaries initially wielded significant influence before colonial rule imposed governmental restraints. They established mission stations that often functioned as small independent states, sometimes weakening local societies and paving the way for colonial rule. The cultural clash between missionary teachings and African traditional religions is highlighted, as missionaries sought to convert Africans to Christianity and Western culture, often undermining traditional authority and practices. Education played a crucial role in this process, with missionaries establishing schools as a primary means of spreading Christianity. Challenges included resistance from African rulers who saw missionaries as threats to traditional authority, rivalry between different missionary groups, and the impact of European colonialism in facilitating missionary activities. The African Times articles complement this by detailing the arduous work of missionaries, such as translating Scriptures, learning local languages, and enduring physical hardships like fevers and weakness, with specific locations like Calabar and the Gaboon illustrating the widespread nature of their efforts. A tragic incident involving Rev. Mr. Duroo, who died during a tornado, underscores the perilous conditions and life-threatening challenges they faced. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view of the missionaries' presence and the adversities they encountered during the colonial period.

# The critique of British governance and influence in West Africa, questioning its effectiveness and impact.

The critique of British governance and influence in West Africa is a complex issue, as highlighted by both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a nuanced view, acknowledging the weakening of indigenous systems of government due to British colonial rule, which diminished the authority of traditional rulers and manipulated chieftaincy institutions. This supports the critique of British governance, as it marginalized local leaders and nationalist movements, maintaining control through strategies that limited local influence. However, the textbook also notes some positive impacts, such as the introduction of new judicial systems and bureaucracies that have persisted post-independence, and the success of West Africans in agriculture, which prevented land expropriation, indicating that British influence did not entirely suppress local economic initiatives. In contrast, The African Times articles offer a more critical perspective, questioning the coherence and effectiveness of British governance systems. The articles highlight the negative impact of British contact, such as the gin trade, which degraded local populations, and contrast this with the positive influence of Islam in advancing civilization and moral standards. This comparison further questions the effectiveness of British influence, suggesting that Islam achieved what British governance did not. Together, these sources present a comprehensive view that acknowledges both the critiques of British governance and its lasting impacts, while also emphasizing its shortcomings and negative consequences.

# The struggle of Christianity to integrate into African cultures and its historical challenges in establishing lasting roots.

The struggle of Christianity to integrate into African cultures and its historical challenges in establishing lasting roots is well-documented in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the emergence of Afro-Christian churches as a response to European-imposed Christianity, where Africans sought to blend their cultural beliefs and practices with the new religion, leading to the formation of independent churches. This reflects the struggle to integrate Christianity with African cultural values. It also discusses the missionaries' negative attitudes towards African traditions, such as initiation rites, which led to conflicts and resistance from African communities. Additionally, the text notes the persistence of traditional religions despite the spread of Christianity, indicating a struggle for Christianity to fully supplant existing beliefs. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize that Christianity, despite its long presence in West Africa, still retains the character of an exotic religion and has not deeply rooted itself in the local soil, lacking strong guarantees for permanence and continuity. The articles also reference the historical failures of Christianity in North Africa and the Roman Catholic form in more recent times, suggesting a pattern of repeated challenges. Furthermore, they highlight internal challenges within the Church's structure and leadership, such as moral weaknesses and faults within the infant Churches and agents, which have led some to view the experiment as a failure. Together, these observations illustrate the complex interplay between Christianity and African cultures, highlighting both the resistance and adaptation that have characterized its historical integration, as well as the organizational challenges that have compounded its struggle to establish lasting roots.

# The imprisonment of European captives in Abyssinia highlights the complex relationship between European powers and African kingdoms during the 19th century.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively highlight the complex relationship between European powers and African kingdoms during the 19th century, with a specific focus on the imprisonment of European captives in Abyssinia. While the General History of Africa does not directly address the specific incident of European captives in Abyssinia, it provides a broader context by discussing the intricate interactions between European powers and African states, including imperialist pressures, strategic treaties, and the competitive nature of European interests. It also touches on the resistance and cooperation of African rulers, as well as internal conflicts within African societies, though it notably omits specific incidents involving Abyssinia. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts of the tensions and misunderstandings between European captives and Abyssinian King Theodore, as highlighted in letters from H. A. Stern. These letters reveal the captives' reliance on diplomatic efforts, such as Mr. Rassam's conciliatory letters, to secure their release, illustrating the diplomatic entanglements between European agents and African rulers. The articles further describe the British military intervention led by General Sir Robert Napier, which resulted in the release of European prisoners and the defeat of Abyssinian forces, underscoring the power dynamics and the willingness of European powers to use force to protect their interests. Additionally, the mention of King Theodore's suicide and the subsequent British withdrawal reflects the transient nature of European influence and ongoing instability in Abyssinia. Together, these sources illustrate the complex interplay of diplomacy, military intervention, and cultural misunderstandings that characterized the relationship between European powers and African kingdoms during this period.

# The release of European captives in Abyssinia demonstrates the diplomatic influence and negotiation capabilities of the British Empire during that period.

The release of European captives in Abyssinia illustrates a complex interplay of diplomatic influence and military intervention by the British Empire, as detailed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced view, highlighting initial diplomatic negotiations where the British government responded to Emperor Tewodros's requests, suggesting some level of diplomatic engagement. However, the re-imprisonment of the captives by Tewodros underscores the limitations of British diplomatic influence and the challenges faced in maintaining effective relations. Similarly, The African Times articles describe a diplomatic mission led by Mr. Rassam, which initially seemed successful as the Emperor ordered the release of the captives and sent a polite letter to the Queen. Yet, the subsequent military intervention by British forces under General Sir Robert Napier, culminating in the defeat of Abyssinian forces and the storming of Magdala, indicates that military pressure played a crucial role in the captives' release. Thus, while there were significant diplomatic efforts, the ultimate outcome was shaped by a combination of both diplomatic and military strategies, complicating the claim that it was purely a demonstration of diplomatic influence.

# The King of Abyssinia detained Europeans to secure diplomatic assurances from foreign powers.

The claim that the King of Abyssinia detained Europeans to secure diplomatic assurances from foreign powers is supported by details in the General History of Africa textbook, which describes how Emperor Tewodros of Ethiopia detained Hormuzd Rassam and other foreigners to compel the British government to respond to his requests for foreign workers and military equipment. Initially, this strategy seemed effective, as the British government agreed to Tewodros's demands. However, relations deteriorated when Tewodros re-imprisoned the captives after learning of a potential British railway project in Sudan, which he perceived as a threat. This aligns with the claim that the King of Abyssinia used the detention of Europeans as leverage to secure diplomatic assurances. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide explicit information regarding the motivations behind the detention of Europeans. They mention the release of European prisoners by King Theodore and their subsequent arrival at the British camp, focusing instead on the military actions of the British expeditionary forces, the defeat of the Abyssinian forces, and the death of King Theodore. The articles express skepticism about the future of Abyssinia following the British withdrawal but do not discuss any diplomatic negotiations or intentions behind the detentions. This absence of information in The African Times is a notable difference, as it leaves the motivations behind the detentions unaddressed in the articles.

# The reluctance to employ African surgeons and the preference for European surgeons reflect systemic racial discrimination within the British colonial administration.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the systemic racial discrimination within the British colonial administration, particularly in the context of employment opportunities for Africans. The General History of Africa highlights the exclusion of Africans from skilled occupations and the imposition of different pay scales for skilled (largely white) and unskilled (largely African, Indian, and Coloured) labor, as exemplified by the Mines and Works Act of 1911 and its amendments. It also discusses the broader context of racial discrimination, such as the denial of equal rights and opportunities to Africans, regardless of their education level, and the systematic removal of educated Africans from positions of responsibility. While the textbook does not specifically mention the employment of African surgeons or a preference for European surgeons, this absence suggests that the claim is consistent with the general pattern of discrimination described. In contrast, The African Times provides direct evidence supporting the claim, highlighting the Army Medical Department's reluctance to employ African surgeons on the West Coast of Africa, despite their proven capabilities. The articles express confusion over the Department's failure to promote African surgeons, especially given the challenging climate conditions that necessitate the recruitment of assistant surgeons. Additionally, a report from two officers on the Gold Coast strongly opposed the increased employment of African surgeons, sparking indignation among educated Africans and aligning with broader efforts to undermine African capabilities, as seen in the revival of racial inferiority theories by the Anthropological Society. Together, these sources illustrate a systemic bias against African professionals and a preference for European surgeons within the colonial administration.

# The high mortality rate among European medical officers due to yellow fever highlights the need for more native African medical professionals.

The high mortality rate among European medical officers due to yellow fever underscores the critical need for more native African medical professionals, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details how European officials in the Gold Coast saw reduced death rates from diseases like malaria and yellow fever through improved sanitary measures and medical treatments. However, it also points out the limited impact of European health methods in Africa, exacerbated by reduced health expenditures during the 1930s depression. This period saw a severe scarcity of medical professionals, with Nigeria having a theoretical ratio of one doctor for every 200,000 people, but only a quarter of these positions were filled. The disparity is further illustrated by the fact that in the 1930s, twelve hospitals served 4,000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered to 40 million Africans. The African Times articles complement this by highlighting the immunity of native-born Africans to yellow fever, which often claimed the lives of European surgeons on the West Coast of Africa. They emphasize the necessity of having adequately qualified native African surgeons and physicians to ensure consistent medical attendance during epidemics. Notably, two African surgeons educated in British medical schools were the only ones not affected by fever or other diseases common in the region, underscoring the importance of employing native African medical professionals. Together, these observations illustrate the advantages of having native African medical staff who are less susceptible to local diseases, thereby ensuring better medical care and reducing the mortality rate among medical officers.

# The achievements of African individuals like Dr. Horton demonstrate the intellectual equality of Africans with Europeans and the impact of British Christian philanthropy.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim regarding the intellectual equality of Africans with Europeans, as exemplified by Dr. James Africanus Horton. Horton's works, such as "West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race," challenged the notion of inherent racial inferiority and argued for the potential of Africans to contribute significantly to global civilization. This intellectual revolution in West Africa, led by Horton and contemporaries like Edward Wilmot Blyden, underscored the emergence of African racial consciousness and pan-Africanism, highlighting the intellectual capabilities of Africans. The African Times further emphasizes Horton's achievements, noting that despite being the son of liberated Africans and lacking the hereditary cultural advantages of Europeans, he successfully vindicated the claim of African mental equality. His accomplishments were facilitated by opportunities provided by British Christian philanthropy, particularly through the Church Missionary Society, and his career in the British Army, where he attained the position of Surgeon-Major, serves as evidence of his professional success. However, the articles also point out that Horton did not receive the decoration of St. Michael and St. George, suggesting racial bias may have influenced this decision, highlighting a disparity in recognition despite his achievements. While the textbook mentions the role of missionaries and the educational activities of the Creoles in Sierra Leone, it does not explicitly link these to British Christian philanthropy, marking a notable difference from the articles, which align with the claim by illustrating both Dr. Horton's intellectual achievements and the role of British philanthropy, while acknowledging the racial barriers he faced.

# The involvement of European missionaries in Africa involved both cultural exchange and imposition, reflecting a complex relationship with African communities.

The involvement of European missionaries in Africa, as observed from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles, reflects a complex relationship characterized by both cultural exchange and imposition. The textbook provides a detailed account of how missionaries were not only spiritual agents but also influential in the political and social dynamics of African societies. They established mission stations that acted as theocratic states, influencing local politics and weakening societies already under economic pressure, thus paving the way for colonial rule. This reflects cultural imposition, as missionaries often acted as agents for European colonialism, encouraging intervention for moral and economic reasons. However, there was also cultural exchange, as missionaries introduced education and new technologies, which some African leaders welcomed, particularly when it emphasized skills over conversion. The emergence of an educated African elite further indicates this complex interplay. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the roles of European figures like Rev. Henry Venn and Dr. John Kirk, highlighting their organizational skills and efforts in areas like the suppression of the slave trade and geographical exploration. While these articles emphasize the dedication and influence of these figures, they do not explicitly address the cultural dynamics of their interactions with African communities, thus not fully engaging with the complexities of cultural exchange or imposition. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted nature of European missionary involvement in Africa, marked by both the imposition of European cultural values and the facilitation of cultural exchange through education and technology.

# The introduction of European civilization to Africa is seen as inevitable and driven by economic interests rather than altruistic motives.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles converge on the claim that the introduction of European civilization to Africa was primarily driven by economic interests rather than altruistic motives. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting this claim by highlighting the economic basis of imperial expansion, as articulated in the theory of economic imperialism. It argues that overproduction, surplus capital, and under-consumption in industrialized nations necessitated political expansion into new areas, with the manipulation of African economies through loans and trade agreements further underscoring these economic motivations. The strategic importance of Africa in global politics is acknowledged, but the need for raw materials and the establishment of export agriculture are emphasized as central to European interests. The role of missionaries, who facilitated European intervention under the guise of moral justification, aligns with the claim that economic interests were paramount, despite some non-economic motivations like national prestige. Similarly, The African Times articles support the claim by suggesting that Europe would inevitably recognize its need for Africa to satisfy its "civilised wants" and "cravings of wealthy luxury," indicating an economic motivation. The mention of "enormous European wealth" and the advancements in modern science and industry further underscore the economic interests driving this interaction. While the articles reference Christian civilization and efforts, these are portrayed as secondary to the primary economic motivations. The call for a "Holy Crusade" and the opening of new realms to the Gospel suggest a religious dimension, but it is framed within the context of economic and civilizational advancement. Thus, both sources align in emphasizing economic interests as the primary driver of European engagement with Africa, with religious and civilizational motives playing a supporting role.

# The perception of Africa as a continent in need of transformation from "darkness" and "barbarism" to "civilization" and "wealth."

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both address the perception of Africa as a continent in need of transformation from "darkness" and "barbarism" to "civilization" and "wealth," though they offer nuanced perspectives. The General History of Africa highlights the impact of colonialism, driven by European racism and cultural chauvinism, which led to the denigration of African culture and history. European colonizers often dismissed pre-colonial African history, as seen in the views of historians like A. P. Newton and Sir Reginald Coupland. However, the textbook also discusses the intellectual revolution in West Africa, where figures like James Africanus Horton and Edward Wilmot Blyden refuted these racist ideas and advocated for pan-Africanism, suggesting a counter-narrative to the European perception. African leaders' attempts to reform their societies, often undermined by European intervention, indicate a struggle against the imposed narrative of needing European-led change. The African Times articles, on the other hand, emphasize the notion of bringing Africa from "darkness to light" and from "barbarism to civilization," reflecting a colonial mindset that Africa required guidance from more "civilized" nations. They advocate for educational institutions in Lagos and Accra, underscoring the belief in education's transformative power. While the articles acknowledge African potential and achievements, they largely support the colonial view of transformation. Together, these sources illustrate the complexity of African responses to European perceptions and interventions, highlighting both the support for and resistance against the narrative of transformation.

# The French expansion in West Africa was perceived as a threat to British trade interests and influence.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that French expansion in West Africa was perceived as a threat to British trade interests and influence. The textbook details the Anglo-French rivalry in the 1860s, particularly over control of Yorubaland and adjacent Aja-speaking communities, highlighting the competition to dominate trade with the hinterland. The French declaration of a protectorate over Porto Novo in 1863 was a direct response to British actions, underscoring the perceived threat to British interests. The British strategy of using treaties of protection and military force to counter French expansion, as seen in the Niger Delta, contrasted with the French reliance on military conquest, intensifying the rivalry. The broader context of European competition, with Germany entering the race in the 1880s, further exacerbated tensions. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize concerns over French activities, such as making treaties and extending influence over territories at the head of the Niger River, crucial for Sierra Leone's trade. The Liverpool Chamber of Commerce expressed alarm over French encroachment, fearing harm to British trade and Sierra Leone's prosperity. The French proposal to cede the Gambia was seen as detrimental to British interests, and the doctrine of the Hinterland was noted as a tool for French expansion at the expense of British colonies, threatening to strangle British trade through French domination. Together, these sources illustrate the competitive dynamics and strategic maneuvers employed by both nations to safeguard their trade interests and influence in West Africa, aligning with the claim of French expansion being a significant threat to British interests.

# The British neglect of certain West African colonies, such as Gambia, led to dissatisfaction and hindered development.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that British neglect of certain West African colonies, such as Gambia, led to dissatisfaction and hindered development. The General History of Africa highlights the neglect of the internal economy in favor of cash crop production, such as Gambia's shift from rice cultivation to groundnut production, which resulted in food shortages and the need for expensive imports. This focus on exports over local needs contributed to malnutrition and famine, with implications for British colonies like Gambia. Additionally, the uneven distribution of educational facilities and inadequate government expenditure on education further hindered development, as colonial economic policies prioritized British interests over those of the colonies. While the textbook does not explicitly mention dissatisfaction in Gambia, The African Times articles provide evidence of local dissatisfaction, highlighting the British Government's neglect of Gambian interests, which alienated native British subjects and even led to considerations of transferring them to French rule. The lack of significant development efforts in Gambia, contrasted with renewed interest in regions like Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, further underscores this neglect. The articles also reference letters and petitions from Gambians expressing dissatisfaction with British administration, restoring the issue to its 1870 position when a similar exchange was abandoned. Together, these sources illustrate how British neglect resulted in both local dissatisfaction and hindered development in Gambia.

# The strategic importance of territorial control and military infrastructure in West Africa during the colonial era.

The strategic importance of territorial control and military infrastructure in West Africa during the colonial era is well-documented in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the extensive military campaigns and conquests by European powers, particularly the French and British, to establish control over West African territories. The French often relied on military force rather than treaties, underscoring the strategic importance of territorial control. The construction of roads, railways, and telegraph lines is noted as essential for logistical support in occupied areas, further emphasizing the role of military infrastructure. Additionally, the use of African mercenaries and levies by European powers provided numerical superiority, facilitating territorial control. The African Times articles complement these observations by detailing specific instances, such as the British mission to Coomassie to maintain political stability and the French erection of barracks in Matacong, highlighting the importance of military infrastructure in asserting control. The potential cession of the River Gambia to France is noted for its strategic value as an inlet to the heart of the country, crucial for trade and civilization efforts. Furthermore, French treaties with native chiefs and military expeditions in the Western Soudan illustrate the competition between colonial powers for territorial influence. Together, these sources illustrate how military infrastructure and territorial control were vital components of colonial strategy in West Africa, focusing on securing immediate colonial objectives and broader geopolitical interests.

# The British and French colonial powers were in competition for exclusive commercial privileges in West Africa.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that British and French colonial powers were in competition for exclusive commercial privileges in West Africa. The textbook details the formal annexation of Lagos by the British in 1861 and subsequent British naval actions against Porto Novo, which prompted the French to declare a protectorate over Porto Novo in 1863. This initiated a period of intense Anglo-French rivalry as both powers sought control over trade routes and political influence in Yorubaland and adjacent Aja-speaking communities, driven by the desire to dominate trade with the hinterland. This rivalry was part of a broader pattern of European activities responding to both metropolitan demands and local situations, further intensified by German involvement in the 1880s, leading to the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. The African Times articles complement this by highlighting British concerns over French attempts to secure exclusive commercial privileges, as evidenced by British merchants' apprehensions about exclusion from trade routes in French-influenced territories. This concern is underscored by Article VIII of the French Treaty with Samadu of 1889. The articles also note the British Government's efforts to ensure no differential treatment in territories under French and British influence, emphasizing the importance of British commercial interests in demarcation negotiations. Additionally, tensions arising from French expeditions entering British protectorates further underscore the competitive nature of colonial expansion and control in the region. Together, these details illustrate the competitive nature of British and French colonial ambitions in West Africa, particularly in securing exclusive commercial privileges.

# The role of private companies, like the Royal Niger Company, in the colonial expansion and administration of African territories.

The role of private companies, such as the Royal Niger Company (RNC), in the colonial expansion and administration of African territories is well-documented in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details how the RNC, initially known as the National African Company, was instrumental in the conquest and occupation of Northern Nigeria, employing military expeditions like the invasion of Nupe in 1897 and securing treaties with local rulers to establish British control. It highlights the company's financial commitment to armed interventions necessary for colonial expansion and its administrative functions, such as setting up trading stations in Igboland. However, it also notes the limitations of private companies in handling coercive state functions, leading to eventual direct governance by European states. Complementing this, The African Times articles emphasize the RNC's strategic role in securing British interests in the Niger region, notably through treaties like the one with the King of Nikki, and outmaneuvering French competitors, such as thwarting Captain Decoeur's treaty efforts. The articles underscore the company's financial sacrifices and strategic establishment of fortified posts, which bolstered British territorial claims. The RNC's significance was further recognized by the British government through the granting of a charter in 1886, solidifying its role as a political instrument in colonial administration. Together, these sources illustrate the pivotal yet complex role of private companies in the colonial enterprise, highlighting both their active involvement and inherent limitations.

# The delineation of territorial boundaries in Africa during the colonial period often led to disputes between European powers.

The delineation of territorial boundaries in Africa during the colonial period often led to disputes between European powers, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights how the partitioning of Africa was driven by European rivalries and treaties, such as the Anglo-French convention of 1863 and the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, which aimed to resolve territorial disputes. It underscores the competition between powers like Britain, France, and Germany, noting specific treaties like the Anglo-German and Franco-Portuguese Treaties that attempted to delineate spheres of influence. Despite these efforts, boundaries often cut across ethnic and linguistic lines, complicating matters further. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize tensions between Britain and France over territorial claims, particularly in the Upper Nile and areas governed by the Royal Niger Company. Diplomatic friction, illustrated by exchanges between Sir Edward Grey and M. Hanotaux, arose from unclear geographical limits and interpretations of agreements like the Anglo-French Convention of 1890. The Say-Barua line, intended to separate British and French spheres, remained contentious due to its vague demarcation, while the Mizon affair highlighted the challenges of enforcing territorial agreements amid nationalistic sentiments. Both sources align with the claim by demonstrating how the arbitrary and competitive nature of boundary delineation led to diplomatic disputes and tensions among European powers in Africa.

# The involvement of high-ranking officials and ambassadors in colonial strategies and international relations.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the involvement of high-ranking officials and ambassadors in colonial strategies and international relations. The "General History of Africa" does not explicitly address the roles of high-ranking officials or ambassadors in these areas, focusing instead on the administrative structures and policies implemented by colonial powers, such as indirect rule and the use of local chiefs as intermediaries. It highlights figures like Sir Frederick Lugard and General Lyautey but omits detailed discussion of diplomatic or high-level political involvement in colonial strategies. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence supporting the claim of high-ranking officials' and ambassadors' involvement. They mention figures like Lord Ripon, the Colonial Secretary, and Sir Claude Macdonald, highlighting their roles in colonial administration and trade matters, such as railway construction and labor recruitment in West Africa. The articles also describe interactions between government officials and commercial interests, as well as the presence of ambassadors at significant diplomatic events, illustrating their active participation in both colonial administration and international diplomacy. This divergence suggests that while the textbook emphasizes administrative and ideological aspects, the news articles highlight the diplomatic and high-level political dimensions of colonial strategies.

# The French government's investment in infrastructure improvements to strengthen its influence and trade in the region.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the French government's investment in infrastructure improvements to strengthen its influence and trade in the region. The General History of Africa highlights the construction of railways, roads, and port infrastructure in North Africa, designed to facilitate the export of minerals and agricultural products, thereby enhancing trade. For example, railways in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco connected mines and towns to export ports, and the modernization of ports like Casablanca and new ports on the Suez Canal underscored the French focus on trade infrastructure. The textbook also notes the establishment of financial institutions and fiscal reorganization to support European-dominated economic activities, though it critiques these developments as colonial, benefiting foreign companies and burdening the indigenous population. This supports the claim of infrastructure as a tool for trade enhancement and colonial control. Meanwhile, The African Times articles both support and refute the claim. They mention a significant investment in improving Kotono, the harbor of Porto Novo, and the subsidization of steamship lines, aligning with the idea of infrastructure investment for influence and trade. However, the _Journal des Débats_ clarifies that the improvement of Port Kotono is undertaken by a private firm without French government financial cooperation, suggesting that the extent of direct government involvement may be overstated. This discrepancy highlights a nuanced reality where infrastructure improvements are evident, but the direct role of the French government may vary, reflecting both strategic investments and private initiatives.

# The British approach to colonial expansion in Africa was portrayed as focusing on free trade and the civilizing mission.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the British approach to colonial expansion in Africa was portrayed as focusing on free trade and the civilizing mission. The General History of Africa highlights Britain's advocacy for free trade as a means to establish economic control, often undermining African rulers' autonomy and manipulating trade agreements to favor European traders. This aligns with the claim of a focus on free trade, as does the British abolition of the slave trade and promotion of 'legitimate trade' as part of their civilizing mission, with missionaries playing a significant role in spreading European influence. However, the textbook also reveals the exploitative nature of British economic activities, such as manipulating debt and establishing Courts of Equity that favored European interests, as well as using military power and treaties to erode local sovereignty, which contradicts the notion of a purely civilizing mission. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize that Great Britain did not seek to derive revenue for the Imperial exchequer from its colonies, instead administering them for the general benefit of the people and the world, aligning with the civilizing mission narrative. The articles highlight Britain's policy of advancing through commercial enterprise rather than military conquest, as seen in the Oil Rivers and the Royal Niger Company's activities, supporting the portrayal of a free trade approach. They contrast this with France's policy of military conquest and exclusive economic benefit for French industries. Overall, while both sources acknowledge Britain's promotion of free trade and a civilizing mission, the General History of Africa provides a more complex picture that includes economic exploitation and political manipulation, whereas The African Times aligns more closely with the claim, depicting British expansion as driven by trade and civilizing efforts.

# The French military presence in Madagascar in the 1880s was intended to establish and maintain French influence without fully conquering the island.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the French military presence in Madagascar in the 1880s, revealing a complex interplay between influence and control. The General History of Africa suggests that French military actions, such as the bombardment of ports and the occupation of Tamatave, were part of a broader strategy to impose a protectorate, indicating an intention to exert significant control over the island. This is further supported by French demands for territorial concessions and land ownership rights for French nationals. However, the text also describes diplomatic negotiations and compromises, such as the vague treaty of 1885 and the 'phantom protectorate' period, which could be seen as attempts to establish influence without outright conquest. Similarly, The African Times articles support the claim that the French aimed to maintain influence without full conquest, noting the occupation of strategic coastal points without advancing into the interior and the demand for a French protectorate over the northern part of the island. The decision not to conquer or evacuate Madagascar, nor refer the issue to arbitration, suggests a strategy focused on influence. Nonetheless, the readiness of the French military to use force, as evidenced by a significant expeditionary force and naval squadron, indicates a potential for a more aggressive stance if necessary. Overall, while both sources highlight elements of maintaining influence, they also reveal intentions and actions that suggest a leaning towards establishing a protectorate and eventual full control.

# The Malagasy people were expected to resist foreign domination, complicating French colonial ambitions.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that the Malagasy people were expected to resist foreign domination, thereby complicating French colonial ambitions. The textbook details various instances of both armed and passive resistance by the Malagasy against French colonial forces, such as the Menalamba movements, the resistance in the Ambongo region, the 1904 rebellion, and the formation of the secret society Vy Vato Sakelika (VVS), all of which illustrate a persistent struggle against French penetration. It also highlights the challenges faced by the Malagasy in uniting their efforts due to regional, religious, and social dissensions. Meanwhile, The African Times articles emphasize the strong likelihood of resistance, noting that the Malagasy population, estimated at around five million, was expected to fight to the last extremity for their independence. The articles also discuss the difficulties of subjugating a large, potentially armed population in a tropical country and mention the purchase of arms in England for Madagascar, indicating external support for their resistance. Additionally, the articles point out that French naval operations, such as shelling forts, did not necessarily reflect the overall willingness or capability of the Malagasy to resist, as they were unprepared for such events. Together, these sources provide a nuanced and detailed account of the complexities and persistence of Malagasy resistance, aligning with the claim that they were expected to resist foreign domination, complicating French colonial ambitions.

# The planters in Réunion were likely to exploit the labor of Malagasy people, effectively continuing the practice of slavery.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that planters in Réunion were likely to exploit the labor of Malagasy people, effectively continuing the practice of slavery. The textbook details how, even after the abolition of the slave trade, slaves continued to be imported into Madagascar under the guise of contract labor, indicating a persistence of exploitative practices. It highlights Réunion's heavy reliance on Madagascar for cattle, rice, and slaves, suggesting a strong economic incentive to exploit Malagasy labor. The colonial imposition of forced labor systems in Madagascar, such as the fanompoana and SMOTIG, are described as "slavery in disguise," implemented to meet labor demands similar to those on plantations. Furthermore, the forced emigration of Malagasy people to Réunion plantations reinforces the idea of continued exploitation. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles express concern that French territorial claims in Madagascar were driven by the interests of Réunion planters, who, having lost access to East Indian coolies due to unjust treatment, might import African slaves under the guise of "apprenticed free laborers." The articles suggest that the planters' labor needs could lead to the exploitation of Malagasy people and potentially the reopening of the slave trade from East Africa. Additionally, the use of the French flag by Arab slave dhows indicates possible complicity in the slave trade by the French government, driven by the interests of Réunion planters. Together, these sources illustrate the planters' motivations and the potential for continued exploitation of labor, akin to slavery, in Madagascar and Réunion.

# The prosperity of Sierra Leone as a colony was linked to peaceful relations among neighboring tribes, which facilitated trade with the interior.

The claim that the prosperity of Sierra Leone as a colony was linked to peaceful relations among neighboring tribes, facilitating trade with the interior, is viewed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced perspective, suggesting that Sierra Leone's colonial prosperity was not primarily due to peaceful inter-tribal relations. It highlights conflicts among groups such as the Temne and Susu, and the Yoni's long wars for freedom, indicating that relations were not entirely peaceful. The textbook attributes economic growth to the British colonial administration, the anti-slavery movement, the establishment of a Creole society, and the integration of Sierra Leone into the world market, with Creoles playing a significant role in establishing trading networks and producing export crops. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by emphasizing that the colony was intended as a commercial hub to civilize the region through trade with the interior. They note that ongoing wars among small tribes initially hindered trade, but the cessation of these conflicts, credited to Sir Samuel Rowe's policies, revived trade and advanced the colony's interests. This suggests that peaceful relations were crucial for facilitating trade and ensuring economic success. Thus, while the textbook downplays the role of inter-tribal peace, the news articles highlight its importance in Sierra Leone's colonial prosperity.

# The British colonization of West Africa was motivated by a desire to suppress the slave trade and propagate Christianity.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the claim that British colonization of West Africa was motivated by a desire to suppress the slave trade and propagate Christianity, though they present a nuanced picture. The General History of Africa highlights British efforts to abolish the slave trade through treaties and interventions, and the establishment of a Court of Equity, supporting the claim of suppression as a motivation. It also discusses the role of missionaries in spreading Christianity, establishing schools, and creating a Western-educated African class, aligning with the claim regarding religious propagation. However, the textbook complicates this narrative by suggesting that economic and political motivations, such as securing trade routes and controlling Islam, were also significant. Similarly, The African Times articles offer a mixed perspective. One article supports the claim by describing colonization as a "magnanimous and philanthropic" effort to suppress the slave trade and spread Christianity, highlighting the Church Missionary Society's role. In contrast, another article presents a critical view, questioning the nobility and success of British influence in West Africa and downplaying the emphasis on slave trade suppression and religious propagation. Together, these sources suggest that while the suppression of the slave trade and propagation of Christianity were factors in British colonization, they were intertwined with economic, political, and other complex motivations.

# The traditional methods of processing fibres in Africa, such as steeping, have been inefficient and detrimental to the quality of the fibres.

The claim that traditional methods of processing fibers in Africa, such as steeping, have been inefficient and detrimental to the quality of the fibers is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not directly discuss traditional fiber processing methods or their efficiency and quality. Instead, it focuses on the broader economic, social, and cultural impacts of colonialism in Africa, such as the neglect of industrialization, the shift from slave trade to export agriculture, and the decline of local crafts due to the importation of cheap commodities. This absence of specific information on fiber processing techniques indicates that the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence supporting the claim, highlighting that traditional methods like steeping rotted and discolored fibers, impairing their beauty and strength. The articles describe the process as tedious, laborious, and unhealthy, and note that fibers cleaned without steeping are more valuable, suggesting that steeping negatively affects quality and market value. They also emphasize the need for mechanical inventions to improve fiber extraction and preparation, underscoring the inefficiency of traditional methods. Together, these observations illustrate the drawbacks of traditional fiber processing techniques in Africa, as reported by The African Times, while the textbook remains silent on the issue.

# The economic value of African fibres can be significantly increased by adopting modern, rapid processing techniques that preserve their quality.

The General History of Africa textbook provides a historical context that indirectly supports the claim that the economic value of African fibers can be significantly increased by adopting modern, rapid processing techniques that preserve their quality. It highlights the colonial period's neglect of industrialization and the importation of cheap commodities, which stifled local industries and crafts, including those that could have processed raw materials like fibers. This historical backdrop suggests that modern processing techniques could potentially enhance the value of African raw materials, although the textbook does not explicitly discuss fibers or these techniques. In contrast, The African Times news articles directly support the claim by detailing the challenges faced with traditional methods, such as the old steeping system that rotted and discolored fibers, impairing their beauty and strength. The articles contrast these methods with modern techniques that clean fibers without steeping, resulting in higher quality and value, as demonstrated by the plantain fiber example, where improved processing increased its worth by £10 per ton. Furthermore, the articles emphasize the untapped potential of Western Africa's fibrous resources, hindered by inefficient extraction methods and a lack of suitable machinery. They advocate for the development and implementation of effective, transportable machines to process these fibers, suggesting that such advancements could unlock significant commercial wealth. Together, these observations underscore the potential economic benefits of adopting modern processing techniques for African fibers.

# The Western Coast of Africa is highly suitable for the cultivation of superior quality fibres due to its climate and soil conditions.

The claim that the Western Coast of Africa is highly suitable for the cultivation of superior quality fibers due to its climate and soil conditions is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information on the cultivation of superior quality fibers in this region, focusing instead on primary products like cocoa, palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, and coffee, as well as historical trade dynamics and socio-political structures. While cotton is mentioned as a cash crop in Uganda, Nigeria, and Tanganyika, there is no detailed discussion about fiber quality or the specific suitability of the Western Coast's climate and soil for fiber cultivation. This absence of information suggests that the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim directly, highlighting historical agricultural practices without delving into fiber specifics. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by emphasizing the region's warmth and humidity, which are conducive to the growth of both exogenous and endogenous fibers. The articles mention specific fibers such as anana, sanseveria, and palm fibers from the oil-palm and wine-palm, noted for their high value, particularly in the silk trade. They also discuss the potential for multiple annual crops of sidas and red sorrel, and the significant yield of sanseveria, indicating the region's capacity for prolific fiber production. The articles suggest that the Western Coast of Africa is richer in useful vegetable fibers than most other parts of the world, reinforcing the claim of its suitability for fiber cultivation. However, they do not provide specific soil conditions, focusing instead on climate and fiber types, which is a notable difference from the claim that attributes suitability to both climate and soil conditions.

# The cultivation and trade of fibres could serve as a catalyst for the spread of civilization and modernization in Africa.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary perspectives on the claim that the cultivation and trade of fibers could serve as a catalyst for the spread of civilization and modernization in Africa. The General History of Africa offers limited direct information on fibers specifically but highlights the broader impact of trade in various commodities, including textiles, on African economies. It notes the displacement of local cotton goods by European imports in Morocco and the success of the woolen textile industry in southern Tunisia, emphasizing the role of trade networks in integrating African economies into the capitalist world-economy. This suggests that trade, in general, contributed to economic and social transformations, though the text does not explicitly link fiber cultivation and trade to the spread of civilization and modernization. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed support for the claim, highlighting the Western Coast of Africa's suitability for growing high-quality fibers like anana, sanseveria, and palm fibers, which are valuable in international markets, including the silk trade. The articles emphasize the potential economic benefits of fiber cultivation, suggesting it could rival historical gold trade in value, encourage industrious habits, and offer a profitable alternative to the slave trade. They also propose that the fiber trade could lead to the abolition of human sacrifices by providing material incentives to native leaders and present the discovery of indigenous nettles like *Rhea* as an opportunity for legitimate commerce akin to the palm oil trade. While these points align with the claim that fiber cultivation and trade could drive modernization, the articles do not explicitly address the broader socio-political changes that might accompany such economic developments, a point of difference for historians examining the full impact of fiber trade on civilization and modernization.

# The cultivation of China Grass in Western Africa could significantly boost the region's economy due to its favorable climate and high demand in Europe.

The claim that the cultivation of China Grass in Western Africa could significantly boost the region's economy is supported by insights from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. While the textbook does not specifically mention China Grass, it provides a contextual backdrop of Western Africa's historical agricultural practices and economic conditions, highlighting the focus on cash crops like cocoa, palm oil, groundnuts, and cotton, which were primarily grown for export to meet European demand. This historical context is relevant to the potential introduction of China Grass as a new export crop, especially considering the challenges of monoculture and lack of diversification in the agricultural economy. Additionally, the textbook discusses the integration of African economies into the international capitalist system, often in an exploitative manner, which could parallel the dynamics of introducing China Grass. On the other hand, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim, emphasizing Western Africa's favorable climate, which lacks injurious frosts, making it ideal for producing high-quality fibre. This contrasts with the South-East African colony of Natal, where frosts pose a disadvantage. The articles also highlight the high demand and prices for China Grass in Europe, suggesting a lucrative market opportunity, and express optimism that the high value of China Grass will offset the disadvantage of high freight rates along the West Coast, making its shipment profitable. However, the articles do not provide specific economic projections or data to further substantiate the claim. Together, these observations suggest that while the potential for economic benefit exists, historical and logistical considerations must be taken into account.

# The development of a profitable fibre trade in Africa was hindered by the lack of efficient transportation and extraction methods.

The development of a profitable fibre trade in Africa was significantly hindered by the lack of efficient transportation and extraction methods, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the importance of infrastructure, such as railways and roads, which were primarily constructed to facilitate the export of cash crops and minerals rather than to support the fibre trade or internal commerce. This suggests that the transportation infrastructure was not optimized for the fibre trade, potentially hindering its development. The text also notes the decline of traditional caravan routes due to the emergence of more efficient transportation methods, indicating initial challenges to trade. However, it does not specifically address the fibre trade or extraction methods, focusing instead on broader economic activities and the impact of colonial infrastructure on export economies. In contrast, The African Times provides specific details supporting the claim, highlighting the inefficiency of native fibre extraction methods and the difficulty of transporting fibres over long distances to the coast due to the absence of roads, necessitating transport by human labor. The articles emphasize the need for improved communication routes and mechanical appliances to reduce transport costs and open up productive districts. Together, these observations illustrate how the absence of efficient transportation and extraction methods posed a significant barrier to the profitable fibre trade in Africa.

# The ongoing issue of slavery in Cuba required international diplomatic intervention.

The ongoing issue of slavery in Cuba necessitated international diplomatic intervention, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details how, despite Spain's strengthened anti-slavery legislation and agreements with London, the slave trade persisted in Cuba until 1866, highlighting the need for further diplomatic efforts. It mentions the Hispano-British Commission's involvement in capturing slave ships, though it was largely ineffective, with only 45 out of 714 captured ships condemned, indicating challenges in enforcement. The British Foreign Office and Admiralty's strategies for suppressing the international slave trade, including bilateral treaties and mixed commissions, further underscore ongoing diplomatic efforts. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the continued importation of slaves into Cuba as a pressing issue for the British Government, pointing to the Spanish Government's failure to fulfill its obligations despite receiving an indemnity to end the trade. This failure is described as an outrage to humanity and an insult to Great Britain, highlighting a diplomatic impasse that required further intervention. The articles also note that Her Majesty's Government had exhausted diplomatic resources to compel Spain to honor its treaty obligations, yet was not prepared to initiate hostilities, illustrating the complexity of the diplomatic challenge. A discussion in the House of Commons, led by Mr. Thomas Hughes, further stressed the need for diplomatic pressure on Spain to address its neglected treaty obligations regarding the Cuban slave population. Together, these observations from both sources illustrate the necessity and complexity of international diplomatic efforts to address the persistence of slavery in Cuba.

# The British Government's treaties with Spain aimed to suppress the African slave trade to Cuba, but Spain failed to fully honor these obligations.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the claim that the British Government's treaties with Spain aimed to suppress the African slave trade to Cuba, but Spain failed to fully honor these obligations. The textbook notes that Spain strengthened its anti-slavery legislation and agreements with London, indicating an intention to cooperate with British efforts. However, it also highlights that despite these agreements, the slave trade continued in Cuba until 1866, largely due to the influence of Cuban planters who resisted abolition for economic reasons. This suggests that Spain did not fully honor its obligations, aligning with the claim. The textbook, however, lacks specific details about the treaties' content or the exact nature of Spain's failures, which could be a point of interest for historians. In contrast, The African Times articles provide more explicit criticism of Spain, noting that the treaties were specifically aimed at suppressing the slave trade to Cuba and accusing Spain of consistently disregarding these obligations. The articles mention that the British Government had to repeatedly address remonstrances to Spain for its systematic violations and criticize Viscount Enfield for his contradictory statements about Spain's compliance. Together, these sources support the claim by emphasizing the inconsistency and failure of Spain to fully comply with the treaties, despite their existence.

# Diplomatic efforts by the British Government to address the issue of slavery in Cuba were ineffective and lacked genuine commitment.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that British diplomatic efforts to address slavery in Cuba were ineffective and lacked genuine commitment. The textbook notes that despite Spain's strengthened anti-slavery legislation and agreements with London, the slave trade in Cuba persisted until 1866, indicating the ineffectiveness of British diplomacy. It also highlights that the Hispano-British Commission condemned only a small fraction of captured slave ships, reflecting inadequate enforcement. Additionally, the British government's broader anti-slavery efforts were often undermined by the economic interests of other nations, such as the USA and France, complicating the effectiveness of British diplomacy. Similarly, The African Times articles criticize the British Government's approach as more sentimental than substantive, suggesting a lack of decisive action. They highlight Spain's false promises and disregard for British remonstrances, and express skepticism about the intentions of the Spanish Government. The articles also criticize the British diplomatic representative, Mr. Layard, for obstructing the anti-slavery cause, and argue that mere remonstrances were ineffective, implying the need for a more robust diplomatic remedy. However, the articles do not offer specific examples of alternative actions, which contrasts with the textbook's detailed account of the broader geopolitical challenges. Together, these sources illustrate the limited impact and insincerity of British diplomatic efforts in curbing the slave trade in Cuba.

# The new Spanish Constitution did not explicitly address slavery, but reforms were anticipated to include its eventual abolition.

The claim that the new Spanish Constitution did not explicitly address slavery, but reforms were anticipated to include its eventual abolition, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences in emphasis. The General History of Africa does not specifically mention the new Spanish Constitution in relation to slavery, but it does highlight Spain's involvement in anti-slavery legislation and agreements with London, while noting that Cuba continued the trade until 1866. This suggests a gradual legislative movement towards abolition, though not directly linked to constitutional reform. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim by stating that the framers of the new Constitution ignored the existence of slavery, yet anticipated its eventual abolition through planned reforms. The articles note that the ultimate extinction of slavery might be implied in the reforms the Government intended to implement once Cuban delegates joined the Cortes. They also emphasize the efforts of abolitionists in the Cortes and the introduction of a Bill by the Zorrilla Ministry for the abolition of slavery in Porto Rico, seen as a precursor to similar measures for Cuba. Together, these sources suggest a broader context of anticipated reforms aimed at abolishing slavery, aligning with the claim, though the textbook does not directly link these efforts to a constitutional change.

# The Spanish Government's failure to uphold treaty obligations regarding the suppression of the slave trade, despite British remonstrations, was a recurring issue.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the Spanish Government repeatedly failed to uphold treaty obligations regarding the suppression of the slave trade, despite British remonstrations. The textbook details how Spain, even after strengthening its anti-slavery legislation and agreements with London, continued the slave trade in Cuba until 1866, indicating ineffective enforcement of treaty obligations. It highlights that the Cortes, the Council of State, and the Treasury succumbed to the threat of secession by Cuban planters, further underscoring Spain's inability to fully comply with its commitments. Additionally, the Hispano-British Commission condemned only a small fraction of captured slave ships, suggesting inefficacy in treaty enforcement. While the textbook does not explicitly mention British remonstrations, it implies ongoing British pressure and dissatisfaction with Spain's actions. Complementing this, The African Times articles emphasize the long-standing neglect of treaty obligations by Spain, particularly concerning the slave population in Cuba. They report that the British Government persistently addressed remonstrances to Spain against the systematic and open violation of these obligations, yet Spain consistently disregarded them. The articles also note complaints from the British Commissary Judge in Havana about local authorities abetting the slave trade and mention the anti-slavery party in England urging the British Government to take action against Spain. Furthermore, they criticize Viscount Enfield's statements, which falsely claim that Spain fulfilled its treaty obligations, despite evidence such as the continued importation of slaves into Cuba. Together, these sources illustrate that Spain's failure to uphold treaty obligations was a recurring issue, despite British efforts to enforce suppression.

---

# The British Government's cautious approach towards pressuring Spain for the emancipation of slaves in Cuba, citing the unstable conditions during the Cuban civil war, was a notable stance.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about the British Government's cautious approach towards pressuring Spain for the emancipation of slaves in Cuba, particularly in relation to the unstable conditions during the Cuban civil war. While the text mentions that Spain strengthened its anti-slavery legislation and agreements with London, it notes that Cuba continued the trade until 1866, influenced by the threat of secession by the island's planters. However, there is no direct reference to the British Government's stance during the Cuban civil war or any cautious approach due to instability. In contrast, The African Times news articles support the claim regarding the British Government's cautious approach. The articles detail that during the Cuban civil war, Her Majesty's Government refrained from insisting that the Spanish Government implement emancipation measures, citing the state of insurrection in the colony as a reason. This aligns with the claim that the British Government was cautious due to the unstable conditions during the civil war. Furthermore, the articles highlight that the British Government intended to remind the Spanish Government of their promises regarding emancipation once the situation in Cuba stabilized, indicating a careful and conditional approach. This cautious stance is further emphasized by the British Government's willingness to act only when the state of affairs in Cuba justified such actions. Together, these sources illustrate a nuanced picture, with The African Times providing specific insights into the British Government's measured response during a period of instability in Cuba, which is not addressed in the General History of Africa textbook.

# The imposition of a duty on Cuban sugar was seen as a strategic measure to pressure Spain and Cuba to end the slave trade.

The claim that the imposition of a duty on Cuban sugar was a strategic measure to pressure Spain and Cuba to end the slave trade is supported by observations from The African Times but not explicitly corroborated by the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook discusses Britain's free-trade measures in 1846, which standardized import duties on sugar for the British market, potentially subsidizing slave estates and leading to increased slave imports into Cuba. However, it does not directly link these duties to a strategic effort to pressure Spain and Cuba to end the slave trade, highlighting a notable absence of this connection. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed support for the claim, advocating for a special duty of 5s. per cwt. on Cuban sugar, explicitly stating that this duty was intended to cover Britain's expenses in suppressing the slave trade, which Spain had failed to control. The articles emphasize that the duty should cease only when the slave trade with Cuba is entirely stopped, underscoring its purpose as an economic pressure tool. They argue that the British market's influence over Cuban prosperity could compel Spain to fulfill its treaty obligations regarding the suppression of the slave trade. Addressing potential objections from free trade advocates, the articles assert that this exceptional duty does not infringe upon free trade principles, as it is based on Spain's failure to meet its commitments rather than the sugar's origin. These details from The African Times align closely with the claim, indicating that the duty was indeed perceived as a strategic measure to influence Spain and Cuba's actions concerning the slave trade.

# The imposition of European colonial rule disrupted traditional African societies and economies.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the imposition of European colonial rule disrupted traditional African societies and economies. The "General History of Africa" provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, detailing how colonialism led to economic exploitation rather than development. It highlights the control of trade by expatriate companies, the discouragement of inter-African trade, and the neglect of industrialization, which marginalized African merchants and stunted the development of business and managerial skills. The text also discusses the imposition of arbitrary political boundaries, disrupting long-standing trade and cultural connections, and the weakening of indigenous governance systems through European-planned taxes and manipulation of traditional chieftaincy, leading to a loss of prestige and authority for traditional rulers. Additionally, it notes the deterioration of women's status and the imposition of racial discrimination, fostering a sense of inferiority among Africans. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide direct information related to the claim, focusing instead on meetings of the Royal Colonial Institute and figures like Colonel Sir Charles Warren and Sir William Mackinnon, without discussing the impact of colonial rule on African societies or economies. This absence of information highlights a potential gap in the coverage of The African Times regarding the effects of colonialism on Africa, possibly indicating an emphasis on colonial administrative and economic interests rather than the experiences of African societies themselves.

# The presence of precious metals and stones in Africa was considered a strong incentive for European immigration and colonization.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that the presence of precious metals and stones in Africa was a strong incentive for European immigration and colonization. The textbook highlights how the discovery of minerals such as gold and diamonds in regions like Southern Rhodesia, the Gold Coast, and Sierra Leone attracted European capital and technical personnel, leading to significant investments from Britain, Europe, and the United States. This influx was driven by the potential wealth these minerals represented, transforming areas like Griqualand West and the Transvaal into focal points of global interest and spurring infrastructure development, such as railways and roads, which facilitated further colonization efforts. However, it also notes that the contribution of these minerals to the general wealth of African countries was limited, as profits were often repatriated to Europe, excluding local populations from benefiting. Similarly, The African Times articles mention Captain Burton's collection of colored crystals and the potential for finding garnets and rubies, indicating an interest in Africa's mineral wealth. Dr. Karl Peters explicitly cites precious metals and stones as direct inducements for immigration, appealing to European imaginations. While these resources were significant incentives, the articles also highlight other factors, such as agricultural and pastoral potential and infrastructure needs, suggesting a broader set of motivations for European interest in Africa. Together, these sources illustrate both the allure of Africa's mineral wealth and the exploitative nature of European colonization efforts.

# The strategic importance of African ports and cities in the British colonial trade network.

The strategic importance of African ports and cities in the British colonial trade network is well-documented in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the economic and political significance of coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo, and Cotonou, which emerged as vital ports and political capitals due to their economic advantages and European interest. The shift from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade further cemented the economic importance of these regions, with infrastructure like railways and roads constructed to facilitate the export of goods from the interior to the coast. The British focus on the Bight of Bonny, along with the establishment of naval squadrons and consuls, underscores the strategic role of these locations. Additionally, East African coastal towns were integrated into international trading networks, playing a crucial role in long-distance trade. The African Times articles complement this by listing steamship departures from numerous African ports, including Madeira, Sierra Leone, Monrovia, Cape Coast Castle, Lagos, and Old Calabar, as part of the routes for steamships like ETHIOPIA and ELMINA. These ports served as key nodes in the trade network, facilitating the movement of goods and passengers. While the articles focus on logistical details rather than broader geopolitical strategies, the flexibility and extent of the network they describe implicitly support the claim of strategic importance, illustrating the active use and connectivity of African ports within the British colonial trade system. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the critical role African ports and cities played in the British colonial trade network, serving as hubs for economic activity and facilitating the movement of goods.

# The colonization of Africa by European powers led to the exploitation of its resources and labor, significantly impacting the continent's economic development.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting levels of detail regarding the claim that the colonization of Africa by European powers led to the exploitation of its resources and labor, significantly impacting the continent's economic development. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim, highlighting forced and migrant labor, compulsory cultivation, and the dismantling of pre-colonial cultures and economies. It discusses the introduction of a money economy that integrated Africa into the global capitalist system in an exploitative manner, characterized by expatriate firms monopolizing profitable sectors, neglecting industrialization, and destroying pre-colonial industries. The text also notes the proletarianization of the African peasantry, structural changes in agriculture with European settlers dominating commercial agriculture, and the focus on cash crops leading to food shortages and dependency on imports. Unequal trade relationships and the exploitation of African resources by European commercial firms further illustrate the exploitative nature of colonial economic policies and their long-lasting negative impact on Africa's economic development. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide explicit information related to the claim. The extract, referencing a journal entry from the West Coast of Africa dated January 28, 1896, lacks specific details or context about the exploitation of resources or labor and does not discuss the economic consequences of colonization. This absence of relevant information highlights a notable difference, as the extract does not directly address or support the claim regarding the historical impact of European colonization on Africa.

# Colonial rule in Africa led to economic exploitation and resource depletion, negatively impacting local economies.

The "General History of Africa" textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim that colonial rule in Africa led to economic exploitation and resource depletion, negatively impacting local economies. It highlights several aspects of this exploitation, such as the use of forced and migrant labor, compulsory cultivation of certain crops, and land seizure, all of which disrupted pre-colonial cultures and economies. Colonial monetary policies, which tied African currencies to those of colonial powers and repatriated African savings, further impeded local economic development. The dominance of European banks and their discriminatory lending practices against African entrepreneurs stifled economic growth. Infrastructure developed during colonial times was primarily designed to facilitate resource extraction rather than promote inter-African trade or overall economic development. The focus on cash crops led to the neglect of food production, causing malnutrition and famine, while the lack of industrialization and destruction of pre-colonial industries hindered technological advancement. The text also notes the negative impact of monocrop economies and the prohibition of Africans from growing certain lucrative crops, which entrenched economic dependency and vulnerability. In contrast, excerpts from The African Times news articles do not contain specific information related to the claim, as the mentions of "Lagos" and "Sir John Pope Hennessy" lack context or details about economic exploitation or resource depletion. This absence of relevant information suggests that these particular articles may not focus on the economic impacts of colonial rule, highlighting a gap in the coverage of colonial economic impacts in the African Times.

# Colonial powers exploited Africa's natural resources and labor, leading to long-term economic challenges for many African nations.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that colonial powers exploited Africa's natural resources and labor, leading to long-term economic challenges for many African nations. The General History of Africa provides substantial support for this claim, detailing how forced and migrant labor systems, compulsory cultivation of certain crops, and land seizures disrupted pre-colonial cultures and economies. It highlights the deliberate neglect of industrialization, which left African economies dependent on exporting raw materials and importing manufactured goods, stunting technological and industrial development. The colonial infrastructure was designed for resource extraction rather than promoting overall economic development or inter-African connectivity. The emphasis on cash crops led to the neglect of food production, causing malnutrition and famine, while colonial economic policies entrenched monocrop economies, making African nations vulnerable to international market fluctuations. The presence of expatriate firms and the elimination of inter-African trade further marginalized African economic participation, illustrating how colonial exploitation created structural economic challenges that persisted into the post-independence era. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide direct information related to this claim. Instead, they focus on endorsements and reviews of a product, presumably a cordial, by various experts and publications, emphasizing the quality and purity of the product without mentioning its origin, production process, or any connection to African resources or labor. This absence of information related to colonial exploitation suggests a media focus on product quality rather than the socio-economic impacts of colonialism, highlighting an interesting difference in the coverage of colonial activities in Africa.

# European colonial rule in Africa imposed political systems that undermined traditional governance structures, leading to long-term political instability.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that European colonial rule in Africa imposed political systems that undermined traditional governance structures, leading to long-term political instability. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting this claim, detailing how colonial powers like the French and British manipulated or dismantled traditional chieftaincies, often appointing chiefs who lacked legitimate authority and turning them into administrative officers. This led to a loss of prestige for traditional rulers and incited revolts against them. The imposition of European-planned taxes and alien bureaucratic structures further weakened African political institutions, while arbitrary colonial boundaries disrupted ethnic and political unity, resulting in chronic border disputes and social dislocation. The indirect rule approach, which subordinated African authorities to colonial governments, eroded traditional governance, and the cultural dismissal of African traditions further destabilized indigenous political systems. In contrast, the excerpts from The African Times do not contain explicit information related to the claim, lacking direct evidence or discussion about the effects of European colonial rule on African political structures. This absence of relevant information is noteworthy, as it suggests that these articles either did not focus on or did not document the political changes and instabilities associated with colonial rule during the specified periods. Together, these sources highlight a comprehensive view of the historical narrative, with the textbook providing detailed evidence of colonial impacts on traditional governance, while the news articles reflect a gap in contemporary reporting on these issues.

# European colonial rule in Africa disrupted traditional societies and political structures, leading to long-term instability.

The General History of Africa textbook provides a detailed account supporting the claim that European colonial rule in Africa disrupted traditional societies and political structures, leading to long-term instability. It highlights the weakening of indigenous governance through the conquest and deposition of rulers, manipulation of chieftaincy, and imposition of European bureaucratic structures. The text discusses the loss of sovereignty and the imposition of fixed colonial boundaries that disregarded pre-existing political and cultural zones, causing divisions among closely related communities. Economic exploitation and racial discrimination under the colonial system exacerbated social tensions and fostered a sense of inferiority among Africans. Additionally, the cultural devastation, including the suppression of African cultural practices and imposition of European norms, contributed to a loss of self-confidence and identity crisis among Africans. While acknowledging some positive impacts, such as increased peace and stability post-conquest, the text emphasizes the overall negative effects on traditional societies and political structures, aligning with the claim of long-term instability. In contrast, The African Times does not explicitly address the claim, as the provided excerpts focus on a summary from the Times and observations on Lord Mayo's work, without discussing the socio-political disruptions and long-term instability associated with colonial rule. This omission is noteworthy, as it contrasts with the broader historical narrative that often highlights these disruptions as significant consequences of colonialism in Africa.

# Colonial rule in Africa imposed foreign political systems that undermined traditional governance structures and social hierarchies.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that colonial rule in Africa imposed foreign political systems that undermined traditional governance structures and social hierarchies. The textbook provides substantial support for the claim, detailing how colonial powers like the French, British, and Belgians manipulated or abolished traditional chieftaincies, often appointing individuals without legitimate claims to leadership roles, thereby diminishing the authority and respect of traditional rulers. It highlights the imposition of European-planned taxes and the use of chiefs as administrative agents, which distorted traditional roles and weakened indigenous political institutions. The introduction of European bureaucratic structures and fixed colonial boundaries disrupted pre-existing political and social systems, leading to a loss of sovereignty and the fragmentation of ethnic and cultural groups. Additionally, the textbook notes the social impact of colonialism, including the depression of African status and the imposition of racial hierarchies, further eroding traditional social structures. In contrast, the excerpts from The African Times news articles do not directly address the claim, focusing instead on personal observations from a journal and discussions of African products, which may pertain to economic or cultural aspects rather than political systems or governance structures. The absence of explicit references to colonial political impositions or the impact on traditional African governance in these articles highlights a difference from the claim, suggesting a focus on other dimensions of African life or interactions with Europe, such as trade or cultural exchanges, rather than the political transformations associated with colonialism.

# European colonizers imposed political systems that undermined traditional African governance and social structures.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting insights regarding the claim that European colonizers imposed political systems that undermined traditional African governance and social structures. The textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim, detailing how colonial powers weakened indigenous systems by deposing or exiling rulers, abolishing traditional monarchies, and appointing chiefs without legitimate claims, thereby diminishing the authority and respect of traditional rulers. It highlights the disruption caused by the imposition of European bureaucratic structures, as exemplified by British and French colonial policies, and the introduction of taxes, forced labor, and new legal codes that altered the socio-political landscape. This eroded the authority of traditional leaders and fostered a mentality among Africans that government property belonged to the colonizers. Additionally, the cultural impact of colonialism, which led to the denigration of African culture and the imposition of European cultural norms, further undermined traditional social structures. In contrast, the excerpts from The African Times news articles, dated September 1880 and April 1, 1886, do not contain specific information related to the claim. This absence of relevant content suggests that the articles, at least in the provided sections, do not address or discuss the impact of European colonization on African political and social systems. This lack of information might be noteworthy to an expert historian, as it could indicate either a gap in the coverage of such topics by the African Times during this period or a focus on other issues.

# The introduction of European education systems in Africa disrupted indigenous knowledge and cultural practices, contributing to a loss of cultural identity.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present a nuanced view of the claim that the introduction of European education systems in Africa disrupted indigenous knowledge and cultural practices, contributing to a loss of cultural identity. The textbook provides detailed support for this claim, highlighting how colonialism imposed the notion of "peoples without culture" on Africans, leading to the condemnation of African art, music, dance, and history. The colonial education system, driven by Christian missions and colonial governments, aimed to create a workforce for the colonial bureaucracy and propagate European cultural values, often at the expense of indigenous practices. This system emphasized liberal and clerical training over technical and industrial education, fostering disdain for manual labor and traditional occupations, and alienating educated Africans from their cultural roots. The policy of cultural assimilation led to a withdrawal from authentic African creative sources by the new elite, exemplified by Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo's struggle with his colonial psyche. However, the textbook also notes that the impact of colonialism on culture was not profound or permanent, as many indigenous practices survived or blended with European influences, particularly in rural areas, indicating resilience and adaptability in African cultures. In contrast, the excerpts from The African Times news articles, dated from 1866 to 1881, do not contain explicit information related to the claim, suggesting either a gap in the historical record or a focus on other issues during that period. This absence of coverage in the articles is noteworthy and highlights the complexity of understanding the historical impact of European education on African societies.

# The introduction of European education systems during colonial rule disrupted traditional African educational practices and cultural transmission.

The General History of Africa textbook provides a detailed examination of how the introduction of European education systems during colonial rule disrupted traditional African educational practices and cultural transmission. It highlights that colonial education was primarily designed to produce Africans who would be more productive for the colonial system, rather than to promote education for its own sake or for the benefit of Africans. The curricula, modeled on those of the metropolitan countries, were often irrelevant to the continent's needs, leading to the neglect of African cultural values and practices. This is exemplified by Sir Gordon Guggisberg's acknowledgment that education had taught Africans to become Europeans instead of remaining African. Additionally, missionary schools, closely linked to evangelization, frequently disregarded African cultural practices, contributing to the alienation of educated Africans from their traditional roots. However, the text also notes that some African societies managed to integrate new educational forms with traditional practices, indicating a complex interaction rather than a complete disruption. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide information related to this claim, suggesting that the articles may not focus on historical educational practices or the effects of colonialism on cultural transmission. This absence of content is noteworthy, as it indicates that the articles either do not address the topic or approach it from a different angle, potentially focusing on other aspects of African history or contemporary issues. Together, these observations underscore the significant impact of colonial education systems on traditional African practices, while also highlighting the varied focus of different sources on this historical issue.

# The introduction of European education and religion during colonization altered African cultural and spiritual practices.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the introduction of European education and religion during colonization altered African cultural and spiritual practices. The textbook provides detailed support for the claim, highlighting how missionaries condemned traditional African practices and sought to replace them with European cultural norms, thereby exerting a disintegrating effect on African culture. It emphasizes the close association between Christianity and education, with schools serving as a primary means of spreading Christian beliefs and influencing African societies. The introduction of a money economy and new crops by mission stations further indicates cultural shifts, while the division of African societies into converts and non-converts led to religious pluralism and social tensions. Despite these changes, the text notes the resilience and adaptation of African cultures, with some traditional practices surviving or blending with European influences, suggesting that the cultural impact of colonialism was not profound or permanent. In contrast, the extracts from The African Times news articles do not provide explicit information related to the claim, focusing instead on a journal from the West Coast of Africa in September 1880 and an abstract of an annual report from 1881, without specific details about European education or religious influences on African cultures. This absence of information is noteworthy, as it may indicate a gap in the coverage of these topics in the African Times or a different focus in the articles from that period. Together, these sources illustrate both the transformative and resilient aspects of African cultural and spiritual practices during colonization, while also highlighting potential gaps in contemporary reporting on these issues.

# The partitioning of Africa by European powers disregarded ethnic and cultural boundaries, leading to long-term political instability and ongoing ethnic conflicts.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the partitioning of Africa by European powers disregarded ethnic and cultural boundaries, leading to long-term political instability and ongoing ethnic conflicts. The textbook provides substantial support for this claim, highlighting how colonial powers created arbitrary boundaries that often cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states, and kingdoms, causing social disruption and displacement. It cites examples such as the Bakongo, Ewe, Somali, and Senufo peoples being divided across multiple countries, resulting in artificial states that have faced chronic border disputes and difficulties in nation-building due to diverse cultures and languages within their borders. The text further discusses how these colonial boundaries became the international boundaries of independent African states, making significant changes difficult without major upheaval, thus aligning with the claim of ongoing ethnic conflicts and political instability. In contrast, the extracts from The African Times news articles do not directly address the claim, focusing instead on specific events or reports related to the West Coast of Africa and Lagos, possibly involving local incidents or annual reports from 1881. There is no explicit mention of the broader geopolitical actions of European powers or their effects on ethnic and cultural divisions within Africa. This absence of information on the partitioning and its consequences suggests that the articles may focus more on localized issues rather than the broader colonial context, a notable difference that an expert historian might find significant.

# The hospitality and generosity of local African leaders played a crucial role in supporting European travelers during their expeditions.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the hospitality and generosity of local African leaders played a crucial role in supporting European travelers during their expeditions. The textbook highlights how missionaries often received a warm welcome from African rulers, who saw potential benefits in missionary activities, such as access to European education and technical skills. This indicates a level of hospitality and openness, while also suggesting that the interactions were driven by strategic motivations, as African leaders sought to gain access to European education and technology. Furthermore, the text describes how European explorers, missionaries, and traders operated within pre-existing African transportation and communication systems, reflecting cooperation and support from local communities. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts of the extensive assistance offered by leaders like King Masaba, who facilitated travelers' journeys by arranging for the free carriage of their loads, and providing horses, provisions, and other necessities. This generosity, quantified in monetary terms, underscores the substantial value of the support received. Travelers were entertained and provided for by various local leaders and communities in towns such as Ilorin, Ogbomosho, Iwo, Ibadan, and Abeokuta, with specific mentions of the provisions and hospitality extended to them. The absence of tolls further highlights the supportive environment created by these leaders. The articles also note the travelers' gratitude towards the Queen and their inability to make adequate returns, suggesting a recognition of the one-sided nature of this generosity. Together, these sources illustrate the crucial role of African leaders' hospitality and cooperation, while also providing context for the motivations behind such interactions.

# The presence of religious figures among the passengers indicates the role of missionary work in the cultural and social exchanges between Africa and Europe.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim regarding the role of missionary work in cultural and social exchanges between Africa and Europe, albeit with some differences in emphasis. The General History of Africa highlights the significant influence of missionaries in Africa, noting their pioneering role in establishing mission stations and schools, which facilitated the spread of Christianity and Western education. These mission stations often became centers of cultural exchange, introducing new ideas and practices to African societies. The text underscores the bidirectional flow of cultural and social influences through the presence of European missionaries in Africa and African students in Europe, as well as the involvement of African evangelists and catechists in spreading Christianity. However, it does not explicitly mention religious figures as passengers between Africa and Europe. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide concrete evidence of religious figures among the passengers, listing multiple clergymen such as Rev. Mr. Halligey, Rev. Mr. Daniati, and Rev. Mr. Dupont traveling from Sierra Leone, and others like Rev. J. E. Cole and Rev. C. H. Goodman traveling to Sierra Leone and the Congo. These details suggest that religious figures were indeed part of the passenger lists, supporting the notion of missionary work as a component of interactions between the continents. However, the articles do not explicitly state the purpose of their travel, requiring inference regarding the extent and nature of their missionary activities. Together, these sources illustrate the role of missionary work in cultural and social exchanges, with the textbook providing context and the articles offering specific examples of religious figures as passengers.

# King Bala Demba of the Bagas sought to establish peaceful and mutually beneficial relations with European powers.

The examination of sources regarding King Bala Demba of the Bagas and his interactions with European powers reveals differing perspectives. The "General History of Africa" textbook does not mention King Bala Demba or any specific actions he may have taken to establish peaceful and mutually beneficial relations with European powers. This absence suggests that either his actions were not deemed significant enough for inclusion or that the textbook focuses on other regions and leaders, thus leaving the claim unsupported or unrefuted by this source. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide details that support the claim, highlighting a letter from King Bala Demba to the German Emperor. In this letter, King Bala Demba explicitly expresses a desire for friendship and mutual recognition, assuring the German Emperor of the peaceful coexistence and protection of Europeans in his country. He also invites Europeans to engage in trade, indicating a willingness to open the Dubreka River to European commerce, thereby demonstrating an intention to foster economic relations. The letter's tone and content align with the claim of seeking peaceful and mutually beneficial relations, emphasizing protection, trade opportunities, and the safety of Europeans in his territory. Thus, while the textbook remains silent on the matter, The African Times provides evidence consistent with King Bala Demba's diplomatic overtures towards European powers.

# The execution of King Darko Yaw by his own people suggests internal conflicts and power struggles within African kingdoms during the 19th century.

The claim that the execution of King Darko Yaw by his own people suggests internal conflicts and power struggles within African kingdoms during the 19th century is supported by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit in different ways. The textbook does not specifically mention King Darko Yaw or his execution, but it does discuss various instances of internal conflicts and power struggles within African kingdoms during the 19th century, such as political instability in the Voltaic regions, succession wars among the Wolof aristocracy, and political maneuvering in Buganda. These examples illustrate the broader theme of internal conflicts and power struggles, aligning with the claim's general context. In contrast, The African Times provides a specific instance of King Darko Yaw of Aquamboe being executed by his own people, describing him as "bloodthirsty and traitorous," which suggests significant discontent and internal strife within his kingdom. However, the articles lack further context or details about the broader political dynamics or specific events leading to his execution, limiting the ability to draw comprehensive conclusions about similar conflicts in other African kingdoms during the same period. The absence of information about King Darko Yaw in the textbook and the lack of broader context in the news articles highlight the challenges in fully understanding the nature and extent of internal conflicts and power struggles across African kingdoms in the 19th century.

# The Ashantee King Quacoe Duah attempted to manipulate regional alliances through bribery and promises of military support.

The claim that the Ashantee King Quacoe Duah attempted to manipulate regional alliances through bribery and promises of military support is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence or details supporting this claim. Instead, it focuses on the broader political and military strategies of the Asante, such as their control over non-Akan states, economic motivations, and interactions with European powers, highlighting the use of tribute systems, military campaigns, and diplomatic missions without mentioning any specific actions by King Quacoe Duah involving bribery or military promises. In contrast, The African Times articles offer substantial support for the claim, detailing how Quacoe Duah sent messengers to Darko Yaw with gifts, including a gold ammunition pouch and 200 ounces of gold dust, to entice him to leave his alliance with other chiefs and join the Ashantee. Furthermore, Quacoe Duah promised military support to escort Darko Yaw and his followers to safety and to subdue opposing chiefs, directly corroborating the claim's assertions. This contrast highlights a notable difference in the coverage of King Quacoe Duah's actions between the two sources.

# The chiefs' decision to consult a fetish priest underscores the importance of spiritual guidance in political decision-making in African cultures.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the importance of spiritual guidance in political decision-making within African cultures, aligning with the claim about chiefs consulting a fetish priest. The textbook provides a broad perspective on the intimate relationship between rulers and the supernatural, as seen in the Shona and Lunda states, where kings were believed to possess sacred qualities and were sanctified by spirit mediums and cult priests. This highlights the role of spiritual guidance in ensuring the well-being of subjects and the fertility of the land. Additionally, the political organization of Liptako involved rituals and sacrifices to supernatural forces during the selection of a new amir, further emphasizing the integration of spiritual practices in political processes. The text also notes the role of religious ideas in resistance movements, where spiritual leaders and symbols were crucial in legitimizing rulers and defending sovereignty. However, it does not specifically mention chiefs consulting fetish priests. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a specific instance where chiefs consulted a fetish priest during a critical moment of political intrigue. The priest's advice to perform rites over the heads of the Ashantee chiefs, which were in the King's possession, was pivotal in revealing the King's guilt and led to his execution. This reliance on spiritual guidance in the articles highlights its significance in political decisions, though it does not claim this was a common practice across all African cultures. Together, these sources support the broader notion of spiritual guidance being integral to political decision-making in African cultures, even if they differ in the specifics of consulting fetish priests.

# Rumors of financial grants to certain parties suggest possible corruption or favoritism within the colonial administration.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim of rumors regarding financial grants suggesting possible corruption or favoritism within the colonial administration. The General History of Africa does not directly address these rumors but offers a broader context of colonial economic and political practices that could indirectly relate to such claims. It highlights the preferential treatment of settlers, economic exploitation, and manipulation of traditional rulers, which could imply favoritism, as well as the use of taxation and financial control mechanisms, such as those seen in Liberia and other colonies, that might facilitate favoritism or corruption. However, there is no explicit mention of financial grants or direct evidence of corruption in the form of financial favoritism within the colonial administration in the provided excerpts. In contrast, The African Times articles lend some support to the claim by mentioning rumors of financial grants to certain parties recommended to the Colonial-office, raising suspicions about fund allocation. While the articles express hope that these rumors are unfounded, they indicate a readiness to discuss the issue further if confirmed, suggesting potential financial mismanagement or favoritism. Despite lacking concrete evidence or specific details about the parties involved, the articles highlight public dissatisfaction with fund allocation, emphasizing the need for investment in public infrastructure and services over other expenditures, such as the Cape Coast Volunteers. This context suggests a climate of financial mismanagement and public discontent, aligning with the claim but not definitively confirming corruption. Together, these sources paint a picture of a colonial administration potentially susceptible to favoritism and mismanagement, though lacking direct evidence of corruption through financial grants.

# The persistence of traditional customs and beliefs despite colonial and missionary influences.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the persistence of traditional customs and beliefs in Africa despite colonial and missionary influences. The textbook provides substantial evidence that the impact of colonialism on African culture was relatively superficial, primarily affecting urban and coastal areas while leaving rural traditions largely intact. African dance, art, music, and religious systems continued to thrive, often incorporating new elements rather than replacing the old. Indigenous religious practices frequently served as a form of resistance against colonial rule, and the emergence of indigenous Christian churches blending traditional beliefs with Christianity illustrates the adaptability and resilience of African cultural practices. This persistence is further evidenced by syncretism in the Americas, where African religious forms were integrated with local and European elements. Complementing these insights, The African Times articles highlight specific instances of traditional practices enduring amidst colonial and missionary efforts. The use of Fetish priests by the Commandant of Badagry to identify alleged thieves, despite the presence of British colonial justice systems, and the jury's protest against such customs, underscore the tension between colonial legal frameworks and indigenous beliefs. The continued practice of consulting Fetish priests and the persistence of the custom of murdering twins in Old Calabar, despite missionary efforts to abolish it, illustrate the deep-rooted nature of these beliefs. Additionally, the use of "Epe," a traditional curse, by members of Ake Church, leading to a tragic incident, exemplifies the ongoing adherence to indigenous customs. Together, these observations demonstrate the enduring nature of traditional African customs and beliefs in the face of external pressures.

# The influence of colonial powers on local alliances and interactions.

The influence of colonial powers on local alliances and interactions in Africa is well-documented in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights how colonial rule disrupted pre-existing political and social structures, severing traditional markets and interactions among communities like the Efik of Nigeria and the Yoruba with their neighbors. The imposition of fixed colonial boundaries often divided closely related peoples, altering traditional alliances. Colonial powers manipulated indigenous governance systems, weakening traditional rulers and altering their roles, which affected local alliances. The preference for traditional rulers as instruments of control further complicated local interactions, as these rulers were often seen as collaborators with colonial powers. New political structures and bureaucracies introduced by colonialism distorted and weakened African institutions, impacting local alliances. The emergence of new elites educated in Western ways created tensions with traditional rulers, affecting local power dynamics and alliances. Similarly, The African Times articles illustrate the colonial influence on local alliances, such as Captain Lees' role in convening a "palaver" to persuade the Awoonahs to sign a peace treaty with the Accras and Addahs, and the Ashantee messenger's assurance of peace with the English. The British Government's involvement in Dahomey's affairs, including the imposition of an indemnity and blockade, demonstrates the direct impact on local governance and trade. European traders' persuasion of the King of Dahomey to negotiate and provide oil for fine payment further reflects the economic influence of colonial entities. Together, these sources provide ample evidence of the significant impact colonial powers had on local alliances and interactions in Africa.

# The resistance to foreign influence and mistrust of European intentions by African leaders.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the resistance to foreign influence and mistrust of European intentions by African leaders. The textbook details the vehement opposition of leaders like Prempeh I of Asante and Wobogo, the King of the Mossi, who rejected European offers of protection, and Mwanga of Buganda, who employed diplomatic maneuvers to resist British control. It highlights strategies such as confrontation and alliance, aimed at defending sovereignty, and notes the suspicion of European missionaries and the subversive nature of trade that undermined African autonomy. The narrative emphasizes that African leaders were slow to unite against European threats due to internal rivalries, underscoring widespread resistance and mistrust during the colonial period. Similarly, The African Times articles reflect this sentiment, with the refusal of chiefs to meet with the Commodore, citing their "fetish" as a reason, interpreted as skepticism rooted in past experiences. The presence of armed natives around Mr. Consul Hopkins further illustrates a defensive stance against foreign intrusion. However, the articles also highlight internal cultural practices and the lack of action by educated natives against these practices, suggesting a focus on internal societal issues. Together, these sources underscore a complex landscape of resistance and mistrust towards European intentions, while also acknowledging internal dynamics within African societies.

# The role of Christian missions in the cultural and social transformation of West African communities during the colonial period.

The role of Christian missions in the cultural and social transformation of West African communities during the colonial period is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the close association between Christianity and education, noting that missionaries established numerous schools, which became a primary means of introducing Christianity to Africans. This educational initiative not only facilitated religious conversion but also contributed to the spread of Western education, literacy, and technical skills, creating a Westernized educated African elite. Missionaries also promoted agriculture, trade, and the introduction of a money economy, transforming the social and economic landscape. They established model farms, technical schools, and translated Christian texts into African languages, bridging cultural gaps and facilitating the spread of Christianity. However, the text also notes the negative attitude of missionaries towards African religion and culture, aiming to replace traditional beliefs with Christian doctrines, which had a disintegrating effect on African culture. The emergence of indigenous Christian churches that incorporated African beliefs and practices into Christian life indicates a complex interaction between missionary efforts and local cultural adaptation. The African Times articles provide additional evidence of Christian missions' involvement, such as the laying of the foundation stone for a new Wesleyan Chapel in Pram Pram, presided over by Rev. F. France, indicating the active presence and influence of Christian missions in the area. The involvement of community members like E. E. Gouch, Esq., and the collection made afterward suggest community engagement and support for the mission's activities. While the articles do not explicitly discuss the broader social transformation, they highlight the role of education and religious truth in preparing individuals for new opportunities, aligning with the idea of cultural transformation through Christian missions. Overall, both sources emphasize the transformative impact of Christian missions while acknowledging the cultural tensions they introduced.

# The struggle between traditional beliefs and imposed colonial authority.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive account of the struggle between traditional beliefs and imposed colonial authority. The textbook highlights how European colonial rule and missionary activities aimed to modify or eradicate African traditional religions and cultural practices, which were deeply embedded in African society. This imposition led to resistance, with Africans either maintaining their traditional beliefs or blending them with Christianity. Specific instances of resistance, such as the Mumbo cult and the Majï Majï movement, used religious and spiritual means to oppose colonial rule. The text also discusses the missionaries' condemnation of traditional practices and the colonial administrations' efforts to suppress certain religious customs, fueling African opposition and leading to the formation of independent churches and schools. Similarly, The African Times articles vividly depict this struggle, with a letter signed by "A Native" criticizing the "disgraceful and barbarous" Fetish customs in Ussher Town, highlighting the tension between indigenous practices and colonial governance. The writer urges the colonial government to abolish these customs, advocating for a unified, civilized rule over the colony, as opposed to the dual authority of traditional Fetish practices and colonial law. The call for the appointment of a registrar and the destruction of Fetish houses underscores the desire to replace traditional systems with colonial structures, while the suggestion to post a policeman who does not believe in Fetish practices to monitor the Fetish priest indicates an attempt to impose colonial authority over indigenous beliefs. Together, these sources illustrate the conflict and efforts to suppress traditional customs in favor of colonial governance, supporting the claim of a struggle between traditional beliefs and imposed colonial authority.

# The colonial perspective that views indigenous beliefs as inferior to Western civilization.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the colonial perspective viewed indigenous beliefs as inferior to Western civilization. The textbook highlights how European colonialists, driven by racism and cultural chauvinism, condemned African cultural expressions such as music, art, dance, and religion, often branding them as primitive or non-existent. This perspective was further enforced by missionaries and colonial administrators who imposed Western names, religious practices, and dress codes on Africans, illustrating the perceived superiority of Western civilization. Mission-educated Africans, influenced by colonial ideologies, often viewed traditional African cultures as inferior and sought to replace them with Western values. The colonial administration's paternalistic approach, involving indirect rule and the use of indigenous institutions in subordinate roles, also reflects a belief in the superiority of Western governance structures. Similarly, The African Times articles criticize indigenous customs, describing them as "disgraceful," "barbarous," and "ungodly," and urge the colonial government to abolish them, suggesting the destruction of Fetish houses and the appointment of a registrar to oversee deaths. This language indicates a clear bias against indigenous customs, portraying them as inferior to the "civilized" government. The articles express disappointment in Governor Dumaresq's decision to allow the re-establishment of Fetish customs, seen as a barrier to "Gospel progress," further aligning with the colonial view that Western religious and cultural practices are superior. Together, these sources reflect a consistent colonial mindset that sought to suppress and replace indigenous beliefs with Western norms.

# The strategic and contested nature of regions during the colonial period.

The strategic and contested nature of regions during the colonial period is well-documented in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the division of African territories and resources among European powers, emphasizing the strategic importance of African labor, diamonds, and gold. It discusses the imposition of arbitrary boundaries that divided ethnic groups and states, leading to social disruption and border disputes, underscoring the contested nature of these regions. The text also elaborates on the different models of resistance and alliances formed by African societies in response to European encroachment, indicating the strategic considerations involved in these interactions. Additionally, the colonial powers' exploitation of African political systems and resources, as well as the economic motivations behind colonial policies, align with the claim of strategic contestation. However, the text focuses more on the impact on African societies and their responses rather than framing these dynamics as a strategic contest between European powers. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide vivid examples of strategic interests and conflicts, such as the historical significance of Akrumasi point and the fort Elise Cartago, where the gold stored led to conflict with natives. The Ashanti War and the bombardment by an English gunboat further underscore the contested nature of the region. The articles also describe geopolitical tensions, such as the arrest and release of M. Hamel, a Dutch agent, by French authorities, and economic competition reflected in the dissatisfaction in Gaboon over heavy duties and differential tariffs against English goods. The unrest in Cameroons following the German annexation and conflicts involving British traders and natives further exemplify the contested nature of these regions. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the strategic and contested dynamics during the colonial period, highlighting both European strategic interests and African resistance and adaptation.

# The economic motivations behind colonial infrastructure projects.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that colonial infrastructure projects were primarily driven by economic motivations. The textbook highlights that colonial powers, such as the British, recognized the economic potential of their colonies and constructed infrastructure like roads and railways to connect mineral-rich areas and cash crop production zones to ports. This integration of African economies into the global market was primarily for the export of raw materials, serving the interests of the colonizers rather than promoting overall economic development or inter-African connectivity. The collaboration between private capital and colonial administrations ensured that infrastructure supported resource extraction and export, often at the expense of local populations. The African Times articles further support this claim by emphasizing the economic motivations behind infrastructure projects, such as the need for roads to facilitate gold mining in the Gold Coast and the construction of a railway from Loango to Brazzaville by the French government, driven by the region's wealth. However, the articles also note that not all infrastructure projects were solely economically motivated, as some, like those related to governance and control, were not directly tied to economic gain. This highlights that while economic motivations were significant, they were not the sole drivers of all colonial infrastructure projects.

# The annexation of African territories by Great Britain was justified as a means to suppress the slave trade and promote civilization.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the annexation of African territories by Great Britain was justified as a means to suppress the slave trade and promote civilization. The textbook highlights Britain's efforts to abolish the slave trade through naval squadrons and treaties with local chiefs, which increased British influence and often eroded local rulers' power, leading to the establishment of British judicial systems. It also notes the role of missionaries in spreading Western influence and the creation of a Creole society in Sierra Leone. However, it points out that these actions were driven by economic interests, such as securing trade routes and markets for British goods, and that the abolitionist ideology was not African in origin, with suppression often enforced through military means. Similarly, The African Times articles support the claim by arguing that the annexation of territories like Lagos was necessary to eradicate the slave trade and advance civilization through education and Christian principles. They justify British presence on the West African coast as essential for annihilating the slave trade and promoting civilization. However, the articles critique the British Government for insufficient support of education, relying too heavily on missionary societies, and call for more active government involvement. Together, these sources suggest that while the suppression of the slave trade and promotion of civilization were used as justifications for British annexation, they were deeply intertwined with economic and strategic interests, revealing a complex interplay of motives behind British actions in Africa.

# The British colonial efforts in Africa were portrayed as bringing Christianity and civilization to regions perceived as being in "dark and heathen ignorance."

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both support the claim that British colonial efforts in Africa were portrayed as bringing Christianity and civilization to regions perceived as being in "dark and heathen ignorance." The textbook details how missionary Christianity significantly influenced African responses to colonial conquest, with missionaries often viewing African cultures as inferior and associating colonialism with Christianity and "civilization." They categorized Africans as "benighted people" and "noble savages," assuming the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through the introduction of Christianity, education, capitalism, and industrialization. Missionaries, armed with the conviction of possessing the only truth, condemned traditional African practices and sought to replace them with European cultural norms, emphasizing the spread of Christianity and Western education, often supported by colonial administrations. However, the text also acknowledges the resilience of African cultures and the selective adaptation of new beliefs, suggesting that the impact of colonialism was not as profound or permanent in the cultural field as the claim might imply. Similarly, The African Times articles echo this portrayal, with Mr. E. H. K. Karskoth-Hugessen, M.P., highlighting British settlements' transition from slave trade hubs to centers for spreading the "blessings of Christianity and civilization." He underscores the role of missionaries and civilizing traders in overcoming native ignorance and prejudice, aligning with the civilizing mission narrative. However, the articles also reveal Britain's economic and strategic interests in maintaining these colonies, suggesting a dual motive of moral duty and commercial benefit. This nuance adds complexity to the portrayal of British colonial efforts, indicating that while the narrative of bringing civilization was prominent, it was intertwined with economic and political objectives.

# The construction of railways and steamship lines was seen as a means to civilize and economically exploit regions like Western Africa.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view that supports the claim that the construction of railways and steamship lines was seen as a means to civilize and economically exploit regions like Western Africa. The textbook highlights that infrastructure, including railways, roads, and telegraph lines, was primarily constructed to facilitate the export of cash crops and minerals, underscoring the economic exploitation aspect. Railways were strategically built to connect interior sources of raw materials directly to the coast, emphasizing their role in the colonial economic system. The infrastructure also facilitated the movement of goods and people, which could be interpreted as a civilizing mission by reducing parochialism and regionalism. The mention of shipping lines dominated by European companies further supports the economic exploitation claim. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the transformative power of railways in "uncivilized" countries, suggesting they could increase trade, dissolve race prejudices, and reduce fanaticism, aligning with the civilizing mission narrative. The articles also note that no philanthropic effort would invest in such infrastructure without expecting a return on investment, highlighting the economic motivations. They acknowledge the challenges posed by the climate and native populations, suggesting that full European colonization was impractical, with the focus instead on developing resources for British trade. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that supports the claim, highlighting both the economic motivations and the perceived civilizing mission behind the construction of railways and steamship lines in Western Africa during the colonial period.

# The British government prioritized its own interests in Africa, potentially at the expense of the native populations.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the British government prioritized its own interests in Africa, potentially at the expense of the native populations. The General History of Africa highlights several instances where British policies, such as the introduction of Imperial Preference and the biased banking system, were designed to benefit Britain rather than the African dependencies. These policies included higher tariffs on non-British goods, a quota system on Japanese textiles, and infrastructure developments in Sudan that primarily served British economic goals. The textbook also notes the use of indirect rule and the exploitation of African rivalries to maintain control, as well as the reluctance to alienate land in British West Africa due to economic rather than protective reasons. These examples collectively suggest that the British government often placed its own interests above those of the native populations. In contrast, The African Times articles acknowledge the prioritization of British interests but also express a hope for mutual benefit, indicating an intention or at least a stated desire for positive outcomes for both the natives and British enterprises. While the articles do not explicitly state that the native populations were disadvantaged, they reflect a complex view that includes both the prioritization of British interests and an aspiration for mutual benefit. Together, these sources illustrate a scenario where British interests were clearly prioritized, yet there was also an expressed hope for positive outcomes for the native populations.

# The British strategy in Africa involved negotiating territorial claims with other European powers, such as Portugal, while balancing international law and colonial interests.

The British strategy in Africa, as observed from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, involved negotiating territorial claims with other European powers, such as Portugal, while balancing international law and colonial interests. The General History of Africa textbook highlights several treaties, including the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, which recognized Portugal's influence in Angola and Mozambique while delimiting the British sphere in Central Africa, and the Anglo-German Treaty of 1885, illustrating Britain's strategy of negotiating spheres of influence with Germany. These treaties, along with Britain's role in the Berlin Conference, underscore their involvement in regulating the Scramble for Africa and limiting the supply of arms, suggesting an implicit balancing of international law and colonial interests. Meanwhile, The African Times articles provide further context by describing ongoing negotiations with Portugal over regions like Delagoa Bay and the Zambesi, with the British Government, led by Lord Salisbury, depicted as cautious in respecting international law while protecting colonial interests and the activities of British companies, such as the South African Company. The articles emphasize the complexity of these negotiations, reflecting Britain's diplomatic efforts to manage its colonial ambitions alongside its relationships with other European powers. Together, these sources support the claim by detailing Britain's negotiation of territorial claims and their involvement in international agreements, illustrating a strategic balancing act between national interests and international norms.

# The British viewed the annexation of territories as a humanitarian effort to eradicate the slave trade and human sacrifices.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a multifaceted view of the British annexation of territories, particularly in relation to the claim that it was a humanitarian effort to eradicate the slave trade and human sacrifices. The General History of Africa acknowledges the role of British humanitarianism and the abolitionist movement, highlighting efforts by British naval officers and consuls to suppress the slave trade and establish legitimate trade through treaties and interventions. This supports the claim that British actions were partly motivated by humanitarian concerns. However, the textbook also emphasizes the economic and political motivations behind these actions, such as the desire to establish favorable trade conditions and exert political influence, suggesting that humanitarian efforts were not the sole or primary motivation. The use of British naval power and gunboat diplomacy, along with the involvement of British traders and the establishment of Courts of Equity, further illustrate the economic interests intertwined with abolitionist efforts. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly support the claim by emphasizing that the annexation of Porto Novo and the surrounding Slave Coast was not driven by territorial ambition or economic gain, as there was "nothing to covet" in these regions. Instead, the articles argue that the annexation was necessary to perform a "work of humanity," specifically to eradicate the foreign slave trade and human sacrifices. They highlight the British Government's reluctance to expand its dominion unless it served the interests of civilization and humanity, suggesting that such annexations were seen as steps in the "onward march of civilization." The articles express a belief that extending British rule would suppress the "gross iniquities of Dahomey" and bring about positive change for local populations. Together, these sources present a complex picture where humanitarian intentions are acknowledged but are interwoven with significant economic and political motivations, challenging the notion that annexation was solely a humanitarian effort.

# The development of Africa's resources and infrastructure was seen as a way to transform the continent into a profitable and healthier environment for British settlers and businesses.

The development of Africa's resources and infrastructure was perceived as a means to transform the continent into a profitable and healthier environment for British settlers and businesses, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the construction of infrastructure such as motor roads, railways, and telecommunication systems, which facilitated the movement of goods, cash crops, and people, integrating African economies into the global market. This development, driven by European capital and often reliant on coerced African labor, primarily benefited European interests, with profits largely expatriated to Europe. The influx of capital and technical personnel from Britain, Europe, and the United States, particularly in Southern Africa, promoted the mining industry and infrastructure development. The British colonial policy of 'native paramountcy' and the use of indigenous personnel in administration further suggest an intention to create a stable environment for economic exploitation. However, this development often led to exploitative economic practices and monocrop economies, leaving African states vulnerable to international trade conditions. The African Times articles complement this by emphasizing the commercial potential of Africa, as highlighted by Mr. H. H. Johnston, who noted the export of valuable resources like rubber, indigo, gums, and cotton, and the presence of precious metals and stones. Johnston's vision of systematic cultivation and settled governance aligns with the idea of economic transformation. He also mentions transforming the "oil rivers" from a swamp into a healthier residential and commercial district, supporting the notion of creating a more habitable environment for settlers. The articles further discuss the potential for Africa to employ British youth and the importance of training individuals for work in Africa, underscoring the focus on integrating British settlers into the continent's development. While the articles do not delve deeply into the health aspect or specific infrastructure projects, they align with the claim by emphasizing economic opportunities and the potential for British involvement in Africa's development. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the motivations and impacts of colonial development in Africa, highlighting both the economic ambitions and the mixed consequences for the continent.

# The existence of slavery in Central Africa during this period indicates that the abolition of slavery was not uniformly enforced across the continent.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the abolition of slavery was not uniformly enforced across the continent, particularly in Central Africa. The General History of Africa provides detailed evidence that, despite the formal abolition of slavery in regions like Angola in 1878, slave labor continued to be integral to economic activities such as cotton, coffee, and sugar-cane production. It also highlights the persistence of domestic slavery and the trans-Saharan slave trade, which remained largely unaffected by Western suppression efforts. The text underscores that the abolitionist movement primarily targeted the Atlantic slave trade, leaving internal and regional slave trades within Africa less impacted, as evidenced by continued slave trade activities in areas like Dahomey until the late 19th century. These insights illustrate the uneven enforcement of abolition across Africa, particularly in Central Africa. In contrast, The African Times articles mention "Slavery in Central Africa" on page 6, indicating that the issue was a topic of interest and concern, yet they lack specific details or context about the nature or extent of slavery in the region or the enforcement of abolition laws. This absence of detailed information highlights a gap in the documentation or reporting of the enforcement of abolition in Central Africa during this period, leaving the claim partially unsupported by the content provided in the articles. Together, these sources reveal a complex picture of the persistence of slavery in Central Africa, despite abolition efforts.

# The skepticism and eventual acceptance of Kilimanjaro's existence highlight the challenges faced by early explorers in gaining recognition for their discoveries.

The skepticism and eventual acceptance of Kilimanjaro's existence highlight the challenges faced by early explorers in gaining recognition for their discoveries, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa notes that Johann Rebmann, a German missionary, was the first European to see Mount Kilimanjaro in 1856, yet his discovery did not immediately capture public attention. It was only when David Livingstone's campaigns against the Arab slave trade gained traction that the broader public began to take notice of East African exploration, suggesting that early explorers like Rebmann faced initial indifference. While the textbook does not explicitly mention skepticism about Kilimanjaro itself, it provides context for the challenges of gaining recognition. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly detail the incredulity faced by Rebmann and Dr. Krapff in scientific circles when they reported a snowy peak in Central Africa. It was only after Von der Decken and New's expedition reached the edge of the eternal snow that professional geographers began to accept Kilimanjaro's existence. This shift from skepticism to acceptance underscores the difficulties explorers faced in validating their findings. Additionally, the articles mention how old chronicles were revisited to argue that Kilimanjaro was already known, illustrating a tendency to downplay new discoveries by linking them to historical accounts. Together, these sources underscore the resistance and challenges early explorers encountered in gaining recognition for their discoveries.

# The leadership of local chiefs played a crucial role in maintaining order and protecting foreigners during times of crisis in African coastal communities.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the role of local chiefs in maintaining order and protecting foreigners during times of crisis in African coastal communities. The General History of Africa highlights the dual role of chiefs within colonial administrative structures, where they often served as intermediaries between colonial powers and local populations, as seen in systems of indirect rule like in Northern Nigeria. However, it also notes instances where chiefs were manipulated by colonial powers, losing their traditional authority, as in the Belgian Congo and French West Africa, and sometimes even leading resistance against colonial forces, such as Mapondera's leadership against Southern Rhodesian and Portuguese forces. This suggests a focus on local interests rather than protecting foreigners, and the text does not specifically address the role of chiefs in coastal communities during crises. In contrast, The African Times provides specific evidence supporting the claim, highlighting the actions of Chief Amagarsbi of Quittah, who played a crucial role in preventing violence against foreigners during a chaotic situation involving the plundering of an abandoned ship. Amagarsbi is praised for his just conduct and protection of strangers, illustrating his effectiveness in crisis management. However, the articles also mention the ineffectiveness of a government agent, "Blavo," in maintaining order, underscoring the variability in leadership effectiveness. Together, these sources illustrate the complex and varied roles of local chiefs, with some, like Amagarsbi, effectively maintaining order and protecting foreigners, while others were constrained or co-opted by colonial powers.

# The construction of roads in Africa by European companies often involved cooperation with local chiefs and communities, but also led to conflicts and violence.

The construction of roads in Africa by European companies often involved a complex interplay of cooperation and conflict with local chiefs and communities, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the use of forced labor for infrastructure projects, such as railways during French colonization in West Africa, where local chiefs were coerced into designating individuals for labor, suggesting a form of forced cooperation. This coercive dynamic often led to resistance and violence, exemplified by the thousands killed in Senegal opposing railway construction. Although the textbook does not specifically address road construction, the parallels with railway projects imply similar dynamics could have occurred. The African Times articles provide further insights, describing cooperation between European project leaders, like Mr. Stewart, and local chiefs, such as those from Chiwinda's village and the Rombushe River area, in road construction efforts from Lake Nyassa to Lake Tanganyika. This cooperation included the involvement of Christianized natives and volunteering chiefs. However, the articles also report conflicts, including attacks on road parties and retaliatory violence, such as the destruction of huts and banana groves. These accounts collectively support the claim that while there was cooperation in road construction, it was often coercive and accompanied by significant conflict and violence.

# Certain traditional customs in Africa, similar to those in other parts of the world, have origins that are obscured by time but are deeply ingrained in the cultural practices of the people.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that certain traditional customs in Africa, akin to those in other parts of the world, have origins obscured by time but are deeply ingrained in cultural practices. The textbook highlights the resilience and persistence of African cultural practices, such as the mbira music of the Shona people, which is deeply embedded in social and religious life and considered a gift from an ancestral spirit, suggesting an origin that is not precisely documented but integral to cultural identity. It also discusses the pervasive nature of traditional African religion, intertwined with cultural practices and reflecting a worldview that includes a hierarchy of spirits and a transcendent yet immanent God, indicating long-standing traditions essential to the cultural fabric. Furthermore, the syncretism of African and European religious practices, such as the blending of Catholic and African elements in the Americas, suggests a deep-rooted cultural adaptability and continuity. Similarly, The African Times articles mention customs occurring annually around harvest time, akin to the Lord Mayor's show in London and Lenten festivities in Paris, indicating a shared global phenomenon of seasonal traditions. These customs, though their origins are veiled in the "misty obscurity of ages," are hallowed by tradition in the minds of the people. The articles also note the evolution of these customs, with more barbarous practices replaced by the blank firing of muskets, showing adaptation over time while maintaining the traditional essence. However, the articles do not provide specific details about the African customs' origins, which could be an interesting point of difference for historians studying the depth of these traditions compared to those in other parts of the world. Together, these observations illustrate how African customs, like those globally, have ancient origins deeply ingrained in cultural practices.

# The presence of European individuals in various African regions suggests a significant European influence and possibly control during the period.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the presence of European individuals in various African regions suggests significant European influence and possibly control during the period. The General History of Africa provides substantial evidence of this influence, detailing the increase in European settlers in regions such as Kenya, Southern Rhodesia, and Algeria, where they occupied fertile lands and controlled trade, indicating strong European influence. The establishment of a colonial administrative grid and the implementation of 'native policy' through indigenous personnel further suggest European control. The role of missionaries and traders in paving the way for colonialism, along with the military and logistical superiority of European powers, underscores their control over African territories, despite limited direct political control before the late 19th century. In contrast, The African Times articles list numerous individuals with European-sounding names in various African regions, such as St. Paul de Loanda, Congo, and Lagos, which could suggest significant European influence. Titles like "Governor" and "Captain" imply roles of authority and control, supporting the notion of European involvement in governance and maritime activities. However, the articles lack explicit information on the nature and extent of European dominance or the local response, differing from the textbook's detailed account of power dynamics. Together, these sources illustrate a significant European presence and its implications for control in Africa during the period, albeit with varying levels of detail and emphasis on the nature of influence.

# The list of names and monetary amounts suggests a historical record of financial transactions or contributions, possibly indicating economic interactions or social hierarchies in Africa during a specific period.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide contrasting yet complementary insights into the claim regarding historical records of financial transactions or contributions in Africa. The General History of Africa does not offer specific details about names or monetary amounts that would suggest such records. Instead, it focuses on broader themes like social and political changes, Africa's integration into the world economy, and the economic implications of slavery, emphasizing macroeconomic and systemic changes rather than individual economic interactions. In contrast, The African Times articles present a list of names with monetary amounts, aligning with the claim by suggesting these could represent historical financial transactions or contributions. The use of specific currency values, such as "5s." (shillings) and "1l." (pounds), indicates a formalized economic system, while the repetition of names with varying amounts hints at social hierarchies or roles within a community. Titles like "Rev." and "Dr." alongside names further imply social stratification. The presence of European-sounding names alongside African ones suggests a colonial context, relevant to historians studying economic and social dynamics in Africa during a specific period. However, the articles do not explicitly clarify the purpose of these transactions, leaving their exact nature open to interpretation. Together, these sources highlight the complexity of economic interactions and social hierarchies in Africa, with the textbook providing a macroeconomic perspective and the articles offering potential microeconomic evidence.

# The mention of multiple European names in African locations implies a network of trade or colonial administration.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the mention of multiple European names in African locations implies a network of trade or colonial administration. The General History of Africa provides substantial evidence by detailing the presence of Portuguese, Dutch, French, and English trading posts and colonial activities across Africa, particularly along the Atlantic coast and in Central Africa. It highlights the establishment of trading centers and administrative bases, such as the Portuguese-African network in Central Africa and British influence in West Africa, illustrating how European colonizers integrated African regions into global trade networks by following and transforming pre-existing trade routes. The text also notes the role of European traders, missionaries, and explorers in penetrating the African interior, often collaborating with local African systems, suggesting that European involvement was an extension of indigenous systems. In contrast, The African Times articles list European names associated with African locations like St. Paul de Loanda, Congo, Gaboon, Lagos, Accra, and Sierra Leone, which historically were involved in European colonial activities and trade networks. The mention of titles such as "Governor" and "Consul" implies administrative roles, aligning with the claim of a colonial or trade network. However, the articles do not explicitly mention trade activities or colonial administration, leaving the nature of these individuals' presence open to interpretation. This absence of direct references is a notable difference, indicating that while the presence of European names might suggest such networks, the articles themselves do not provide explicit evidence of these activities. Together, these sources illustrate the complex interplay of European and African systems, with European names in African locations serving as markers of historical trade and colonial networks.

# The listing of arrivals from different regions indicates a network of communication and transportation that connected various parts of Africa with each other and with Europe.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of a network of communication and transportation connecting various parts of Africa with each other and with Europe. The General History of Africa describes the movement of traders between coastal ports and the interior, highlighting flexible and interlocking networks that existed locally and with European traders. It notes the commercial unification of Africa in the nineteenth century through transcontinental routes linking Central, East, and North Africa, as well as the trans-Saharan and caravan routes connecting Tripoli with other regions, underscoring the connectivity between Africa and Europe. Although the textbook does not explicitly list arrivals from different regions, it provides substantial evidence of a well-established network. Complementing this, The African Times articles offer a detailed listing of arrivals from diverse regions, such as Fernando Po, Old Calabar, Bonny, Little Popo, Cape Coast Castle, Sierra Leone, and Madeira, facilitated by steamers like the Benguela, Benin, Monrovia, Volta, Biafra, Congo, and Loanda. This illustrates a robust maritime network that enabled movement and interaction, supported by the presence of professionals like captains, consuls, and engineers, indicating an exchange of expertise and information. While the articles do not explicitly mention connections to Europe, the variety of locations and regularity of arrivals imply a broader network likely extending beyond Africa, potentially including European connections. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the intricate communication and transportation networks that linked Africa internally and with Europe.

# The renaming of geographical features in Africa by colonizers represents a broader pattern of cultural erasure.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles together provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the renaming of geographical features in Africa by colonizers represents a broader pattern of cultural erasure. While the textbook does not explicitly address the renaming of geographical features, it offers a broader context of cultural erasure and imposition by colonial powers, highlighting the condemnation of African cultural practices, the imposition of European names and norms, and the alienation of educated Africans from their cultural roots. This broader narrative aligns with the claim, suggesting that the renaming of geographical features is part of this pattern, despite its absence in the text. In contrast, The African Times provides a specific example of this phenomenon, detailing how a lake was renamed "Lake Victoria" instead of its indigenous name "Nyanza," reflecting the imposition of colonial power and the marginalization of local identities. However, the articles do not delve into the broader implications or provide additional context about other instances of cultural erasure, limiting their scope to a single example. This difference highlights the need for further exploration of the motivations behind such renaming and its impact on local communities, which would interest expert historians seeking a comprehensive understanding of cultural erasure in Africa.

# The hills in West Africa are believed to have formed through subaerial denudation, with quartz reefs often serving as their structural backbone.

The claim that the hills in West Africa are believed to have formed through subaerial denudation, with quartz reefs often serving as their structural backbone, is supported by observations from The African Times but not explicitly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook primarily focuses on the geographical, cultural, and historical aspects of various African regions, mentioning features like the Atacora and Kukuru hills but not delving into the geological processes or compositions of these hills. This absence of geological detail contrasts with the detailed explanation provided by The African Times articles, which describe the region's landscape as consisting of flat swampy plains with chains of hills that increase in elevation inland. The articles support the claim by explaining that these hills formed through subaerial denudation, where harder landscape portions resisted erosion, and highlight the role of quartz reefs as the structural backbone of many hills. Additionally, the articles note the steepness of the northern slopes due to the southward dipping of the enclosed quartz reef, offering further geological context. Thus, while the textbook lacks specific geological insights, The African Times provides a detailed account consistent with the claim about the formation of West African hills.

# The exploration of Kilimanjaro highlights the rapid progress in the exploration of Central Africa during the late 19th century.

The exploration of Kilimanjaro, as discussed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, presents differing perspectives on its significance in the context of Central African exploration during the late 19th century. According to the General History of Africa, the initial European sighting of Kilimanjaro by J. Rebmann occurred in 1856, predating the late 19th century and not directly linked to the broader exploration of Central Africa during that later period. The textbook emphasizes the activities of missionaries and traders, focusing on trade routes and the influence of European and Arab traders, rather than highlighting Kilimanjaro's exploration as a marker of progress. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the achievements of explorers like Dr. Hans Meyer, who reached significant heights on Kilimanjaro, and the scientific contributions of earlier explorers such as Thornton, Von der Decken, Thomson, and Johnston. These articles portray the exploration as evidence of rapid progress, noting the shift from skepticism to recognition of Kilimanjaro's snowy peak as a major geographical discovery. However, they also acknowledge a tendency to downplay new discoveries by referencing historical accounts, suggesting a blend of new achievements with historical continuity. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view of Kilimanjaro's exploration, highlighting both its role in the narrative of exploration progress and the complexities of historical interpretation.

# The exploration of the Cameroons Mountain highlighted the challenges faced by explorers, such as extreme cold and difficult terrain.

The exploration of the Cameroons Mountain, as highlighted by The African Times, underscores the significant challenges faced by explorers, including extreme cold and difficult terrain. The news articles detail the intense cold during the final ascent, with temperatures dropping to 33 degrees and travelers' waterproof coats covered in hoar frost, aligning with the claim of extreme cold. The difficult terrain is further emphasized by the seven-hour duration required to cover the last five miles, compounded by loose boulders and rolling rocks. Additionally, Miss Kingsley's exploration involved crossing mud swamps and enduring heavy rains without a tent, illustrating the challenging conditions. The peak's height of 13,700 feet and the ten-day duration for the ascent and return further underscore the difficulty of the terrain. In contrast, the General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information on the exploration of the Cameroons Mountain or the associated challenges. Instead, it focuses on various historical events, missionary activities, colonial encounters, and resistance movements across different parts of Africa, without delving into the exploration challenges specific to the Cameroons Mountain. This absence of information in the textbook highlights a notable difference from the detailed accounts provided by The African Times, which vividly capture the arduous conditions faced by explorers in this region.

# The strategic importance of controlling trade routes and ports in colonial Africa.

The strategic importance of controlling trade routes and ports in colonial Africa is underscored by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights how European colonizers capitalized on existing trade routes established by Arab, Swahili, and Indian merchants in East Africa, emphasizing their significance for economic activities. The construction of railways by the British and Germans to connect coastal areas with the hinterland further illustrates the importance of controlling these routes for facilitating trade and resource extraction. In West Africa, the Asante's struggle to control European trading posts on the coast underscores the strategic value of these locations for maintaining trade channels. The transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade also highlights the critical role of ports in economic exchanges. European powers sought to control inland trade routes to access interior markets directly, bypassing coastal middlemen, thereby expanding their economic influence. Complementing these insights, The African Times articles describe the British naval presence off the coast of Whydah, using military force to enforce economic demands, such as the fine imposed on the King of Dahomey. The threat of a blockade and the presence of British war-vessels underscore the significance of controlling access to ports, crucial for trade and the movement of goods, like the 200 puncheons of oil demanded as indemnity. The logistical challenges, such as communication difficulties due to heavy surf, further illustrate the strategic considerations involved in maintaining control over these trade routes. Together, these sources demonstrate the lengths to which colonial powers went to secure and control trade routes and ports, highlighting their economic and strategic importance during this period.

# The aggressive and unilateral actions of European powers in African territories.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim of aggressive and unilateral actions by European powers in African territories. The textbook highlights the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, convened by Bismarck, as a pivotal event where European powers, without serious consideration of African interests or participation, laid down rules for the partition of Africa. This led to the doctrines of spheres of influence and effective occupation, facilitating the unilateral annexation and control of African territories by European nations. The text describes how European powers systematically conquered and occupied African lands through treaties and military invasions, often exploiting local rivalries and lack of unity among African states. The aggressive nature of these actions is underscored by the use of military force and the imposition of colonial rule, disregarding the sovereignty and rights of African peoples. Additionally, the manipulation of treaties and monopolization of arms to maintain control illustrate the unilateral and forceful approach of European imperialism in Africa. Similarly, The African Times articles provide specific examples of such aggression, such as Dr. Nachtigal's replacement of the British flag with the German ensign in the Beh territory, exemplifying unilateral annexation. Another instance is the German man-of-war's forceful entry into Old Calabar, a British protectorate, and the arrest of King Eyo without prior consultation with British representatives. These incidents highlight the high-handed approach of Germany and reflect the broader pattern of European powers exerting control over African territories through forceful and independent actions. Both sources align with the claim by detailing the aggressive and unilateral strategies employed by European powers during the Scramble for Africa, with no information provided that refutes this narrative.

# The tensions and conflicts between European powers over African territories during the colonial period.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view of the tensions and conflicts between European powers over African territories during the colonial period. The General History of Africa highlights the Anglo-French rivalry in the 1860s, leading to the Anglo-French convention of 1863 and subsequent conflicts in the 1880s with Germany's entry into the colonial race. The Berlin Conference of 1884, convened by Bismarck, is noted as a pivotal event where European powers formally partitioned Africa, underscoring the underlying tensions. Despite these rivalries, European powers managed to resolve colonial issues without resorting to war, displaying a spirit of solidarity that prevented African rulers from exploiting their divisions. Strategic maneuvers, such as the British occupation of Egypt in 1882, provoked international reactions and further colonial annexations by Germany. The African Times articles add to this narrative by highlighting the suspicion and rivalry between French and English authorities, with the French suspecting English merchants of engaging in the slave trade. Additionally, a direct conflict between Portuguese and British interests is described, where Portuguese forces crossed into British-protected territory, removed the British flag, and replaced it with the Portuguese flag, illustrating the aggressive territorial disputes. Together, these sources underscore the competitive and conflict-ridden nature of European interactions over African territories during the colonial period, aligning with the claim of tensions between European powers.

# The presence of European ships and their cargoes indicates a strong European interest in African resources.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore a strong European interest in African resources, as evidenced by the presence of European ships and their cargoes. The textbook details the rapid expansion of European trade in Africa, driven by the demand for resources such as palm oil, groundnuts, ivory, and cloves, which were often transported by European ships. It highlights the aggressive policies of European powers for overseas expansion, their strategic and economic interests, and the role of European traders, missionaries, and explorers in penetrating the African interior to access these resources. The efforts to control trade routes and secure commercial privileges, along with the reliance on African mercenaries and levies, further indicate a strong interest in exploiting African resources. However, it also notes that local and regional trade dynamics were more dependent on African communities' internal systems than on European influence, suggesting a nuanced interaction between European interests and African agency. Complementing this, The African Times articles report the arrival of the African Royal Mail steamship Ethiope at Liverpool with a cargo including gold dust, palm oil, ivory, gum, and beeswax, and the brigantine Catherine laden with palm oil from the West Coast of Africa, highlighting significant European engagement in the extraction and transportation of African resources. While these articles align with the claim of European interest, they lack a comprehensive analysis of the broader economic or political motivations and the impact of such trade on African societies, a notable difference that limits the understanding of the full extent and implications of European involvement in Africa during this period. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of European interest in African resources, while also highlighting the complexities and nuances of the historical context.

# The severe working conditions and mistreatment faced by sailors in the region are highlighted by the refusal of the crew to re-embark on the Thomas Bazley and the lack of a clear motive for the mutiny.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim regarding the severe working conditions and mistreatment faced by sailors in the region. The textbook primarily focuses on the harsh conditions and exploitation faced by African laborers under colonial rule, such as forced labor, low wages, and poor working conditions, but it does not specifically address maritime labor issues or incidents like the refusal of the crew to re-embark on the Thomas Bazley or the lack of a clear motive for the mutiny. This absence highlights a gap in the textbook's coverage of maritime labor struggles. In contrast, The African Times articles offer more direct insights into maritime issues. The article on the Thomas Bazley supports the claim by detailing the crew's refusal to re-embark due to Stott's brutality, underscoring the mistreatment and poor working conditions that prompted their decision. However, the article on the Mary Richmond complicates the claim by not providing a clear motive for the mutiny, leaving the connection between the mutiny and working conditions ambiguous. While the first article aligns with the claim by illustrating mistreatment, the second article lacks specific details to directly associate the mutiny with poor working conditions, highlighting a notable difference in the coverage of maritime labor issues.

# Maritime voyages from the West Coast of Africa to Europe were perilous and could result in severe hardships, including illness and death among the crew.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information directly related to the claim that maritime voyages from the West Coast of Africa to Europe were perilous and could result in severe hardships, including illness and death among the crew. While it discusses high mortality rates among African laborers due to disease and poor conditions, this is in the context of labor camps rather than maritime voyages. The text also addresses the transportation of slaves across the Atlantic with associated high mortality rates, but this pertains to the transatlantic slave trade rather than voyages to Europe. Additionally, it mentions African sailors in European merchant services without detailing the conditions or hardships of these voyages. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide several details supporting the claim. Captain Hannan's account of the Florence Pope's voyage describes crew members dying from African fever, severe weather conditions leading to the vessel's abandonment, and deaths from exposure after abandoning the ship. Similarly, the barque Ottercope's encounter with the brigantine Catherine highlights the perilous nature of such voyages, with the Catherine's captain and mate dead, the crew sick, and the vessel short of essential supplies after 82 days at sea. These accounts illustrate significant risks and hardships faced during maritime voyages from the West Coast of Africa to Europe, aligning with the claim.

# The British administration in Cape Coast was ineffective in preventing local resistance and uprisings against their rule.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the ineffectiveness of the British administration in Cape Coast in preventing local resistance and uprisings against their rule. The General History of Africa highlights several instances of resistance, such as the Anglo-Xhosa war of 1850-3, which stemmed from British attempts to undermine Xhosa independence, leading to significant grievances and resistance. The annexation of Xhosa territories and the imposition of white magistrates further fueled local discontent. Additionally, the Asante's military engagements with the British, including attacks and occupations of southern and coastal states, necessitated a decisive British campaign to regain control. Economic resistance also manifested in the form of cocoa hold-ups in the Gold Coast, where local producers withheld their produce to demand better prices, challenging the colonial economic structure. Complementing these historical accounts, The African Times details a specific instance where around two thousand Cape Coast men openly defied British authority by joining the allied army of the Fantees, an act conducted publicly and without effective deterrence from the British. Mr. Ussher's private admission of his inability to prevent such public displays of defiance further illustrates the administration's limited power. The destruction of property, including the burning of a house, as a reactionary measure by the British, underscores their inability to prevent initial acts of resistance. Together, these accounts from both sources vividly illustrate the challenges faced by the British in maintaining control and preventing uprisings, affirming their ineffectiveness in Cape Coast.

# Portuguese adventurers, along with Arabs from Zanzibar and Mombasa, monopolized the ivory trade in East Africa, hindering the development of free trade in the region.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer contrasting perspectives on the claim that Portuguese adventurers and Arabs from Zanzibar and Mombasa monopolized the ivory trade in East Africa, hindering the development of free trade in the region. The General History of Africa presents a nuanced view, highlighting the involvement of a diverse array of participants, including Arabs, Swahili, Indian merchants, and African traders such as the Yao, Bisa, and Chikunda, rather than attributing a monopoly to Portuguese adventurers and Arabs. It emphasizes the significant role of Indian merchants in conducting the ivory trade through Bombay and notes the presence of American traders in Zanzibar, suggesting a complex network of trade integrated into the broader international capitalist economy. In contrast, The African Times supports the claim by detailing how Portuguese adventurers, in collaboration with Arabs from Zanzibar and Mombasa, controlled the ivory trade, effectively locking up East Africa from legitimate dealers and the beneficial effects of free trade. The articles focus on the immense supplies of ivory from inland regions and do not provide information that refutes the claim or offers a different perspective, nor do they mention the involvement of other groups or regions, such as the River Gambia or Western African tribes, in the ivory trade. This juxtaposition of sources highlights differing interpretations of the dynamics of the ivory trade in East Africa.

# The Imperial Government's involvement in African defense included providing armaments, while local colonial governments were responsible for supplying sites, materials, and labor.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the claim regarding the Imperial Government's involvement in African defense. The General History of Africa highlights the strategic use of arms and ammunition by European powers in Africa, emphasizing the monopolization of weapons as a critical factor in the balance of power. It references international agreements like the Brussels Act, which regulated the supply of arms to African rulers, indicating a level of imperial involvement in armament control. However, it does not explicitly state that the Imperial Government directly provided armaments to African defense efforts. Instead, it describes how African societies acquired weapons through international trade and diplomacy, often playing European powers against each other. The text also discusses the role of colonial governments in utilizing local resources, such as labor and materials, for military purposes, aligning with the claim that local colonial governments were responsible for supplying sites, materials, and labor. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically mention that the Imperial Government provided armaments for the defense of the Cape of Good Hope, while the Cape Government supplied the sites, materials, and labor for construction, supporting the claim of a division of responsibilities. However, the articles do not clarify whether this arrangement was consistent across other African regions, focusing instead on a specific instance. Together, these sources suggest a complex interplay between imperial and local colonial roles in African defense, with the textbook providing broader context and the articles offering specific examples.

# The fluctuation in prices for African goods like palm oil and ground nuts suggests the volatility and competitive nature of the colonial trade system.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the volatility and competitive nature of the colonial trade system for African goods such as palm oil and groundnuts. The General History of Africa highlights the fluctuating prominence of natural rubber in West Africa during the 1880s and its decline following a price crisis in 1912-13, illustrating the instability in the market for African commodities. It also details how the production of palm oil and groundnuts was heavily influenced by international demand and market conditions, with significant imports by France from Senegal and The Gambia. The competitive nature of the trade is further exemplified by European traders moving between ports in search of favorable terms and the informal division of economic interests among Western nations. The impact of price fluctuations on local economies is evident, as seen in the economic distress in Bailundu, Angola, following a drop in rubber prices. Complementing these insights, The African Times articles report on the fluctuating prices of palm oil and groundnuts, with palm oil prices showing an advance of 5s. for River Oils and irregular advances for Lagos, followed by a considerable decline, with Grand Bassam at £24 and Lagos at £29 to £28 10s. per ton. Ground nuts from Sierra Leone are sold at £9 per ton, while fine Bathurst is priced at £15 per ton, indicating a significant price range. The articles also note the weak demand and price decline for palm kernels, further supporting the notion of market volatility. Together, these details from both sources vividly illustrate the competitive and unstable market environment of the colonial trade system, where African producers were often at the mercy of international market forces and price fluctuations.

# The strategic location and colonial interest in Fernando Po:

The strategic location and colonial interest in Fernando Po are well-documented in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the island's proximity to the Cameroon coast and the eastern Niger delta, emphasizing its strategic importance for monitoring trade and political activities. British agents, such as John Beecroft, settled there, and the British even attempted to purchase the island from Spain to bolster their suppression efforts in the Bight of Biafra. The presence of British Baptist Mission Society missions further indicates a colonial interest in spreading influence through religious and cultural means. Additionally, Fernando Po's role in forced labor shipments from Liberia to Spanish planters underscores its economic significance in colonial trade networks. The African Times adds that the Admiralty maintained a coal depot for Her Majesty's ships, highlighting the island's strategic value for naval operations as a refueling station. The Germans also showed interest in constructing a coaling establishment and attempted to purchase the island, given its proximity to German possessions on the African coast, only about forty miles away. However, Spanish pride prevented the sale, indicating resistance to changing colonial control despite the strategic interest. Together, these observations illustrate Fernando Po's strategic location and the colonial interest it attracted from European powers like Britain and Germany.

---

# The Spanish colonial administration in Fernando Po was marked by oppressive governance and neglect:

The claim that the Spanish colonial administration in Fernando Po was marked by oppressive governance and neglect is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with varying levels of detail. The General History of Africa does not provide specific details about the Spanish administration's governance structures or policies in Fernando Po, but it does highlight the forced shipment of indigenous Liberians to the island to labor for Spanish planters. This practice, which raised international concern and threatened Liberia's sovereignty, suggests a form of exploitation and oppressive labor practices, aligning with the claim of oppressive governance. However, the textbook lacks comprehensive information on broader aspects of Spanish colonial practices, limiting its ability to fully confirm or refute the claim of neglect. In contrast, The African Times articles offer a more detailed account, describing the Spanish government's disregard for the liberties and well-being of the island's inhabitants. The articles highlight the imposition of arbitrary edicts by the Governor, such as restrictions on public meetings and property seizures without due process, alongside acts of violence and abuse of power. This left the population feeling vulnerable to irresponsible officials. Additionally, the articles depict a scene of neglect, with Fernando Po described as deteriorating despite its agricultural potential, and St. Isabel characterized by neglected infrastructure and a lack of economic activity, serving primarily as a convict settlement. These observations from The African Times strongly support the claim of oppressive governance and neglect by the Spanish colonial administration in Fernando Po.

---

# The Spanish rule on Fernando Po suppressed local aspirations and contrasted with previous British governance:

The claim that Spanish rule on Fernando Po suppressed local aspirations and contrasted with previous British governance is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa notes that in 1858, the Spanish governor declared Catholicism the official religion, marginalizing the British Baptists at Clarence and indicating a suppression of religious diversity and local aspirations. This contrasts with the earlier British presence, which allowed for the establishment of Baptist missions, schools, and workshops, reflecting a more inclusive approach that engaged with local communities and supported educational and religious activities. The African Times further corroborates this claim by highlighting the expulsion of Primitive Methodist missionaries by the Spanish governor, described as an act of oppressive religious bigotry, contrasting with the freedom of worship under British rule. The articles also depict the island's decline under Spanish governance, noting its retrogression despite its potential for productivity. The portrayal of the local population, descendants of liberated slaves, as being made docile and obedient under Spanish rule, supports the notion of suppression, with their "bumptious ideas" supposedly fostered by English governance being driven out. Additionally, the use of Fernando Po as a convict settlement for Cuban insurrectionists underlines the repressive nature of Spanish administration. Together, these observations from both sources align with the claim of suppression and highlight the stark contrast between Spanish and British governance on the island.

# Africa has the potential to become a major supplier of cotton.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that Africa has the potential to become a major supplier of cotton. The General History of Africa highlights the early 20th-century British recognition of Sudan's agricultural potential, particularly for cotton cultivation, and the successful experimental cultivation in Sudan's Djazïra plain, which led to the development of an ambitious irrigation plan and the establishment of the Sudan Plantation Syndicate. This initiative, despite delays due to World War I, eventually succeeded and stimulated related activities such as transportation and ginning factories, indicating a robust infrastructure for cotton production. Cotton became a significant cash crop in regions like Sudan and Uganda by the mid-20th century. However, the text also notes challenges such as the lack of diversification in the agricultural economy and the absence of technological advancements. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the presence of productive soil, a laboring population, and abundant cotton plants in regions like Soudan and the Niger, as highlighted by Dr. Baikie. He stresses the need for stimulus, capital, and machinery to realize this potential. The successful agricultural efforts by Mr. M. B. Horton in Bendoo, Sherboro, where over 100 acres have been cultivated with cotton and other crops, further demonstrate the region's potential. The thriving Egyptian and Sea Island cotton varieties in the Sherboro climate, coupled with optimism about shifting cotton production to Africa due to the decline of cotton and slavery in the Southern United States, underscore the continent's potential. Both sources agree that with the right investments and conditions, Africa could significantly contribute to the global cotton supply, although challenges remain to be addressed.

---

# The Sherboro region is suitable for cotton cultivation and has the potential to develop a robust cotton industry.

The claim that the Sherboro region is suitable for cotton cultivation and has the potential to develop a robust cotton industry is supported by observations from The African Times, though not addressed in the "General History of Africa" textbook. The textbook primarily discusses agricultural and economic developments in other African regions, such as Sudan, Egypt, Southern Rhodesia, and the Gold Coast, with a focus on British efforts to develop cotton industries there, but it notably lacks any mention of the Sherboro region. This absence suggests that the textbook does not provide evidence to support or refute the claim regarding Sherboro's suitability for cotton cultivation. In contrast, The African Times articles provide several details supporting the claim, highlighting the presence of a considerable quantity of cotton produced near the navigable waters of Sherboro, available at a moderate price, indicating the region's suitability for cotton cultivation. The articles describe Mr. M. B. Horton's successful farming operations at Bendoo, Sherboro, where he has cultivated over 100 acres, including cotton, and harvested significant quantities of clean cotton. The thriving of Egyptian and Sea Island cotton varieties in the region further supports its suitability. Additionally, the articles emphasize the favorable climate for cotton cultivation and the region's proximity to England, which could facilitate trade. However, they also note the need for adequate capital and good direction of efforts, indicating that while the potential exists, certain conditions must be met to fully realize a robust cotton industry. Overall, The African Times provides historical context and evidence of the region's potential, aligning with the claim, while the textbook's lack of information on Sherboro remains a notable gap.

# The potential for cotton as a cash crop in Africa was recognized, but its success depended on the involvement and investment of foreign merchants and industries.

The potential for cotton as a cash crop in Africa was widely recognized, but its success was heavily dependent on the involvement and investment of foreign merchants and industries, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the Egyptian administration's recognition of cotton's importance for revenue generation and debt repayment, particularly during the American Civil War, which spurred cotton production in Egypt. British fiscal reforms and investments in infrastructure further promoted cotton exports, underscoring the crucial role of foreign investment. The British search for alternative cotton sources to reduce reliance on the United States further emphasizes the involvement of foreign industries. However, the textbook also notes that market conditions, such as falling prices, could impact success, indicating that foreign involvement was necessary but not solely sufficient. Similarly, The African Times articles detail the need for machinery and market access, with hopes pinned on Manchester merchants to trade merchandise for raw materials, highlighting reliance on foreign investment. The involvement of local traders like Ama Abokko was contingent on market openings, while French manufacturers' exploration of cotton cultivation in Senegal depended on European demand and government support. Both sources illustrate the recognized potential of cotton in Africa and the critical role of foreign involvement in its success.

# The trade in palm oil served as a significant economic substitute for the slave trade on the West Coast of Africa, particularly south of the River Gambia.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the trade in palm oil served as a significant economic substitute for the slave trade on the West Coast of Africa, particularly south of the River Gambia. The textbook details the transition from the slave trade to palm oil as a dominant factor in the export economy of Dahomey, driven by changing economic conditions and external pressures such as abolitionist movements and European demand for palm oil. It notes that while the region had always exported palm oil in small quantities, the 19th century saw a significant increase, indicating a shift in economic focus. This transition required more manpower, leading to the use of war captives as labor for the palm oil industry rather than as commodities for export, a trend mirrored in the Mono-Niger region and on the Gold Coast, where palm oil became the leading export by 1840. The textbook acknowledges that the slave and palm oil trades co-existed for a time, suggesting a gradual transition. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight palm oil as the great staple of Western Africa and a major substitute for the slave trade, despite challenges such as difficult access to the interior and local customs. The articles emphasize the palm oil tree's value to native Africans, providing resources like oil, wine, vinegar, thatch, fibre, and fuel, underscoring its economic importance. However, they lack specific quantitative data or comparisons to the slave trade's economic scale. Together, these sources illustrate the significant role of palm oil trade in replacing the slave trade, while acknowledging the complexity and gradual nature of this economic transition.

---

# The economic success of the palm oil trade in the oil rivers region of Africa was achieved without significant government intervention, suggesting that local trade could thrive independently of colonial administration.

The economic success of the palm oil trade in the oil rivers region of Africa, as discussed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, presents a nuanced picture of local trade dynamics. The General History of Africa highlights the significant economic shift from the slave trade to the palm oil trade in West Africa, particularly in the Niger delta, emphasizing local economic adaptation and success. However, it also underscores the role of European influence and demand, with European trading firms like Victor Régis persuading local rulers such as King Gezo of Dahomey to intensify palm oil trade, indicating that external factors played a crucial role in this economic transformation. The African Times articles support the claim of minimal government intervention, noting that the region's natural resources and river access allowed Europeans to demonstrate the value of palm oil, leading locals to focus on its production. Yet, the articles also mention occasional government intervention by the Commodore to maintain order, suggesting some level of oversight was necessary. Together, these sources suggest that while the palm oil trade thrived with limited colonial administration, it was not entirely independent of external influences or occasional government involvement, reflecting a complex interplay of local and external forces.

# The fluctuation in prices and demand for African commodities may reflect the impact of European market conditions on African economies during the colonial era.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the fluctuation in prices and demand for African commodities during the colonial era was significantly influenced by European market conditions. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of monocrop economies in African colonies, which made them highly sensitive to international trade conditions. This sensitivity is exemplified by the impact of the Great Depression of 1929-33 on African colonial economies, exposing their vulnerabilities. The textbook also discusses the decline of the rubber industry in East and Central Africa following an international price crisis in 1912-13, and the unequal exchange between African producers and European markets, where Africans received low remuneration for exports while paying high prices for imports. This unequal exchange was shaped by the asymmetry in political power and the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. Meanwhile, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts of the variability in prices and demand for commodities such as palm oil, cotton, sugar, and coffee, highlighting their sensitivity to supply and demand dynamics likely influenced by European market conditions. For instance, the palm oil market is described as firm due to reduced stock, with prices varying based on location and time, while the cotton market experiences periods of depression and recovery. The articles also note the impact of limited supply on the coffee market, suggesting that European demand and supply constraints directly affect commodity prices. However, the articles focus more on market specifics rather than the broader economic or political context, which is an interesting difference from the textbook's broader analysis. Together, these sources illustrate how European market conditions significantly impacted African economies during the colonial period, reflecting fluctuations in prices and demand for African commodities.

# The mention of African goods alongside those from other regions like Brazil and India indicates Africa's integration into a broader global trade network during this period.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of Africa's integration into a broader global trade network during the period in question. The General History of Africa highlights Africa's trade connections with regions like Brazil, emphasizing the exchange of goods such as cigars, tobacco, rum, local fabrics, cola nuts, and palm oil, which signifies Africa's participation in transatlantic trade. It also discusses the role of African products like ivory, wax, copal, oil, and coffee in the global market, illustrating the continent's economic ties with the wider world. The text underscores the involvement of African merchants in international trade and the influence of European manufactured goods on African markets, reflecting Africa's incorporation into the capitalist world-economy. However, it also points out the unequal nature of these trade relationships and the technological limitations that hindered Africa's competitiveness with industrialized economies. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide evidence of African goods such as coffee, cocoa, gum, and palm oil being traded alongside products from Brazil, India, and Jamaica, indicating Africa's active participation in international markets. The mention of specific African locations like Lagos and Bonny in the context of palm oil sales further underscores this involvement. While the articles do not explore the broader implications of this trade integration, they align with the claim by illustrating Africa's role in a global trade network. Together, these sources provide a nuanced understanding of Africa's integration into global commerce, highlighting both its active participation and the complexities of these trade relationships.

# The Ashanti War of 1874 was perceived as a pivotal event that could lead to significant geopolitical changes in West Africa.

The Ashanti War of 1874 is widely perceived as a pivotal event with significant geopolitical implications in West Africa, as detailed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook describes the war as a decisive defeat for the Asante, leading to the disintegration of the Asante empire and the recognition of independence for its vassal states. This defeat weakened Asante's military power, prompting further fragmentation and civil unrest within the empire. The British capitalized on this by instigating member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, further destabilizing the region. The Treaty of Fomena, which followed the war, forced Asante to renounce its rights on the Gold Coast, marking a shift in the balance of power. The textbook also highlights the broader context of European imperialism during this period, noting the strategic importance of arms monopolization and the role of international agreements in shaping colonial ambitions. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the belief that the war marked the effective destruction of Ashanti as a power, leading to the disintegration of its influence over tributary states like Juabin, Becqueh, and Mampong. The expectation was that these regions would seek direct alliances and trade with Great Britain, thereby bypassing Ashanti's control. The articles also highlight the strategic importance of opening up trade routes and access to the interior, including the unexplored Kong Mountains, which were believed to be rich in gold. This aligns with the claim by suggesting that the war could catalyze broader economic and political shifts in the region. Additionally, the articles reflect a broader narrative of colonial ambition, with the British press and authorities advocating for increased influence and control in West Africa, further supporting the notion of the war as a transformative event. Together, these sources illustrate how the Ashanti War of 1874 contributed to significant geopolitical changes, including the weakening of Asante's influence and the expansion of British colonial control in West Africa.

# The British colonial administration in West Africa faced criticism for its oppressive and violent methods of maintaining control.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the British colonial administration in West Africa faced criticism for its oppressive and violent methods of maintaining control. The textbook highlights several instances, such as the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898 in Sierra Leone, which arose in response to British-imposed taxes and oppressive measures, leading to violent confrontations. It also details the British use of military force in regions like Asante and the Niger Delta, and the punitive expedition against Benin, illustrating the violent methods employed to maintain control. Furthermore, the exploitation of African workers through forced labor is noted as a significant aspect of the colonial economy that drew criticism, with resistance movements and ideological protests indicating widespread dissatisfaction with British rule. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles report on brutal punishment methods, such as the death of a man by flogging and shot drill, as highlighted by the West African Herald, which underscores the oppressive nature of the colonial administration. The articles also reflect a critical stance towards the authorities, describing a "grave evil" and calling for intervention from Downing Street and advocates for truth, freedom, and justice, further emphasizing the dissatisfaction and criticism of the colonial administration's actions. Together, these sources reinforce the narrative of criticism against the British colonial administration's oppressive and violent methods in West Africa.

# The African Times played a significant role in advocating for the emancipation of Africans in the late 19th century.

The claim that The African Times played a significant role in advocating for the emancipation of Africans in the late 19th century is supported by observations from The African Times articles but not explicitly corroborated by the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook does not provide specific information linking The African Times to emancipation advocacy during that period, instead focusing on the role of newspapers in disseminating anti-colonial and anti-imperialist propaganda during the inter-war period, which is later than the late 19th century. It highlights contributions from individuals and movements in the intellectual revolution and pan-Africanism but does not attribute a specific role to The African Times. In contrast, The African Times articles suggest that the publication was perceived by some, such as A. Beimpabeya, as a catalyst for emancipation, with its editor's "wonderful pen" credited for contributing to this cause. The publication's mission to document and stimulate West African progress towards Christian civilization, intellectual and material development, and social power aligns with broader emancipation goals. However, the articles also critique figures like Charles Bannerman for using editorial influence for personal gain, indicating complexities and deviations from the mission. Overall, while The African Times appears to have been involved in advocating for African progress, the evidence from the textbook and articles presents a nuanced picture of its role in late 19th-century emancipation efforts.

# The British colonial rule on the Gold Coast was seen as failing to protect the rights and welfare of its subjects, contrary to the promises of British law and governance.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that British colonial rule on the Gold Coast was perceived as failing to protect the rights and welfare of its subjects, contrary to the promises of British law and governance. The General History of Africa highlights several aspects of this failure, such as the inadequate and uneven distribution of educational facilities, which were designed to serve the colonial system rather than benefit the local population, indicating a neglect of their welfare. Additionally, the colonial administration's economic policies, including monopolistic control over the cocoa trade and suppression of collective actions by African producers, further demonstrate a disregard for the economic rights and welfare of the inhabitants. The resistance to British land control, exemplified by the formation of the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society, underscores the failure to respect local rights. Moreover, the exclusion of African elites from meaningful governance participation contradicts British principles of representation and rights. The African Times articles echo these concerns, highlighting abuses of power by colonial officials, such as a judge claiming authority above the law and an administrator failing to protect against such abuses, suggesting a lack of accountability and protection. Calls for a Court of Inquiry and skepticism about the fairness of reports on colonial conduct reflect a broader distrust in the administration's transparency and integrity. While the articles also attempt to refute specific allegations, indicating differing perspectives, the overall perception aligns with the claim that British colonial governance failed to uphold the rights and welfare of its subjects.

# The involvement of high-ranking officials in addressing local administrative issues indicates the importance of colonial governance in maintaining order and efficiency.

The involvement of high-ranking officials in addressing local administrative issues underscores the importance of colonial governance in maintaining order and efficiency, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the pivotal role of European colonial administrators, such as governors or resident-generals, who wielded sovereign-like powers and directed both European subordinates and African authorities within a centralized and often authoritarian system. This structure, particularly evident in French, Portuguese, and Belgian colonies, emphasized the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis and the use of consultative councils and commercial interests to assist these officials. However, it also notes the limitations of such a system, with its paternalistic nature and restricted political power for Africans. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide concrete examples of high-ranking officials' involvement in local matters, such as the Postmaster-General in England and the Governor of the Gambia, Colonel D'Arcy, addressing postal service issues, and Secretary-Lieutenant-General Peel and the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief investigating an alleged assault in Bathurst, Gambia. These instances highlight the significance of communication, order, and grievance redressal in colonial administration. The communication between F. Fitzgerald, the proprietor and editor of the African Times, and high-ranking officials further illustrates the channels through which colonial governance sought to manage local issues. Together, these sources illustrate the active role of colonial authorities in managing local administrative matters to uphold order and efficiency, while also acknowledging the inherent challenges and limitations of the colonial system.

# The presence of inadequately educated officers in key administrative roles in the Gambia is a concern for the effective governance of the colony.

The General History of Africa textbook does not specifically address the issue of inadequately educated officers in key administrative roles in the Gambia, focusing instead on broader aspects of colonial administration, such as the manipulation of traditional rulers, intermediary structures, and the economic and political challenges faced by colonies. It highlights issues like the riots in Sierra Leone and economic hardships in West Africa but does not directly mention the educational qualifications of officers in the Gambia or their impact on governance. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide detailed support for the claim, highlighting concerns about inadequately educated officers in the Gambia. One article points out that the Gambia courts are staffed by merchants and clerks lacking the qualifications to serve as magistrates and commissioners, posing a significant obstacle to justice. It also criticizes the high expenditure on the Secretary's department, noting that many officers are "mere boys" without a complete African schooling, rather than Europeans with a sound English education. Another article, while focused on Sierra Leone, echoes the theme of inadequately qualified individuals in administrative positions, criticizing the rapid promotion of those with limited qualifications. Together, these articles underscore the inadequacy of education and qualifications among officers in administrative roles in the Gambia, highlighting it as a barrier to effective governance, a concern not directly addressed in the General History of Africa.

---

# The use of flogging and shot drill as punishment in West Africa under colonial rule was brutal and inhumane.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that punishment under colonial rule in West Africa was brutal and inhumane. The General History of Africa textbook provides a broad overview of the harsh punitive measures employed during this period, such as judicial floggings, forced labor, imprisonment, mutilation, and punitive expeditions, including the burning of villages. These examples illustrate the brutal nature of colonial punishment practices, although the textbook does not specifically mention the use of "flogging and shot drill." In contrast, The African Times articles provide explicit details about these specific methods, highlighting the "dreadful and disgusting facts" reported by the West African Herald, including the death of a man due to flogging and shot drill. This underscores the severity and inhumanity of such punishments. Additionally, the articles express strong concern about the broader context of grave injustices and call for intervention, reinforcing the perception of these practices as unacceptable and brutal. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of the inhumane treatment under colonial rule in West Africa, aligning with the claim despite the textbook's omission of certain specific methods like the shot drill.

# The withdrawal of British authority from M'Carthy's Island was seen as potentially detrimental to peace, trade, and civilization in the Gambia.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim regarding the withdrawal of British authority from M'Carthy's Island and its potential impact on peace, trade, and civilization in the Gambia. The textbook does not directly address this specific claim, as it lacks mention of M'Carthy's Island and its significance in the context of British withdrawal, focusing instead on broader aspects of British colonial influence and withdrawal in different regions of Africa, such as Sierra Leone and the Orange River Sovereignty. This absence of information suggests a gap in the textbook's coverage of British colonial activities in West Africa, which an expert historian might find noteworthy. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by expressing concerns that the proposed abandonment of M'Carthy's Island would be "fatal to peace, trade, progress, and civilisation in the Gambia." The articles emphasize the perceived necessity of British authority as a stabilizing force, particularly in addressing complaints from educated African traders about abuses and the influence of subordinates and merchants. However, they do not provide specific details about the actual withdrawal process or its immediate consequences, focusing instead on the broader implications and the need for continued British oversight to ensure progress and prepare the natives for self-government. This lack of specific information about the withdrawal itself is a notable difference from the claim.

# The involvement of English missionaries and politicians indicates a belief in a moral obligation to assist Africa beyond the abolition of slavery.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that English missionaries and politicians believed in a moral obligation to assist Africa beyond the abolition of slavery. The textbook highlights the role of missionaries in promoting European intervention in Africa, not only to end the slave trade but also to stimulate economic opportunities and spread Western education and culture. Missionaries were seen as agents of colonialism, consciously paving the way for European powers, and they often encouraged intervention as a morally justified undertaking. Their involvement in establishing missions and schools, as well as efforts to modernize African societies, indicates a belief in a broader moral mission. The text also acknowledges the influence of abolitionist ideology, rooted in moral philosophy and humanitarianism, suggesting that British involvement was driven by a combination of moral, economic, and political motivations. Similarly, The African Times articles describe a meeting of the Central African Mission, where resolutions emphasized the need for England to provide "loving care and Christian teaching" following the abolition of slavery, indicating a belief in ongoing moral duty. The endorsement of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa by prominent figures further underscores the commitment to philanthropic and Christian efforts. Additionally, the call for government intervention in the slave trade and the amelioration of conditions for enslaved children reflects a broader humanitarian concern. Together, these sources illustrate a perceived moral obligation to assist Africa beyond merely ending slavery, consistent with the claim.

# The colonial administration on the West Coast of Africa was criticized for its inability to address or rectify injustices within its legal system.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view that supports the claim that the colonial administration on the West Coast of Africa was criticized for its inability to address or rectify injustices within its legal system. The textbook highlights the formation of various clubs and associations by educated Africans, such as the Aborigines Rights Protection Society (ARPS) in the Gold Coast, which actively protested against colonial abuses and legal injustices. The ARPS's actions, including sending delegations to London to oppose specific colonial bills, underscore the dissatisfaction with the colonial legal system. The text also notes that the colonial system weakened indigenous governance structures, with officials often acting as dictators, exacerbating legal injustices. The manipulation of traditional rulers to enforce unpopular measures like forced labor and direct taxes led to revolts, reflecting widespread discontent. Furthermore, the exclusion of Africans from decision-making processes contributed to a mentality of detachment from government responsibilities, indicating a lack of trust in the colonial legal system. Complementing these insights, The African Times articles detail specific instances of legal injustices, such as a magistrate allegedly ordering the forcible shaving of a woman's head, described as an "outrage" and highlighting the absence of a fair trial system. The articles criticize the lack of satisfactory conclusions from colonial authorities and question the fairness of a legal system without trial by jury for civil cases. Additionally, public discourse and scrutiny of legal proceedings, as seen in the defense of Mr. McCarthy's conduct in a murder trial, further reflect dissatisfaction with the colonial legal framework. Together, these sources illustrate a critical stance towards the colonial administration's handling of legal matters, consistent with the claim.

# Missionaries in Africa were seen as effective agents of civilization and education, often more so than local magistrates or government officials.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that missionaries in Africa were perceived as effective agents of civilization and education, often more so than local magistrates or government officials. The General History of Africa highlights the significant role missionaries played in establishing educational institutions, such as elementary schools, training colleges, and secondary schools, which were crucial in spreading literacy and Western education across various African regions. These efforts were instrumental in promoting agriculture, technical skills, and trade, contributing to raising living standards and introducing new ideas associated with 'civilization.' Missionaries were also pivotal in creating an educated African elite involved in professions like teaching, journalism, and law, thereby shaping the social and political landscape of colonial Africa. Although the colonial administrations supported these educational efforts through grants, suggesting a collaborative process, the missionaries' impact often surpassed that of local magistrates or government officials. Similarly, The African Times articles reinforce this notion by highlighting that missionaries were seen as efficient agents for civilizing and educating, as evidenced by Colonel Thayre's assertion that a missionary and his wife were more valuable to the administration than multiple magistrates. The articles suggest that closer collaboration between governments and missionaries could enhance development efforts, as demonstrated by the positive perception of Major Jones's interest in missionary work. However, inefficiencies arose from a lack of coordination, such as the failure to maintain roads built by missionaries, indicating that their contributions could be maximized with better governmental support. Together, these sources underscore the missionaries' substantial influence in education and civilization, often surpassing that of local officials.

# Missionaries in Africa were often criticized for their perceived lack of contribution to local communities and for living in relative comfort compared to the people they served.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that missionaries in Africa were often criticized for their perceived lack of contribution to local communities and for living in relative comfort. The textbook suggests that missionaries played a significant role in shaping African societies, often acting as agents of colonialism and introducing new cultural and religious practices that weakened local societies. They established mission stations that sometimes functioned as small independent states, which could be perceived as living in relative comfort compared to local communities. While the text highlights their role in education, conversion, and the introduction of new technologies, it does not explicitly state that missionaries were criticized for living in comfort or lacking contribution. In contrast, The African Times articles provide more direct evidence of such criticisms. Mr. Harris criticizes missionaries for not working, wearing formal attire, living in "the high house," and eating "expensive dinners," suggesting a perception of comfort and insufficient contribution. However, a missionary's response challenges this view, implying that their lifestyle does not detract from their hard work. Additionally, the articles mention criticism of missionaries for "intermeddling with other people's affairs," which, while not directly related to the claim of comfort, highlights another dimension of the criticism they faced. Together, these sources illustrate a complex picture where missionaries were both criticized and defended, with criticisms sometimes aligning with the claim and other times focusing on different aspects of their presence in Africa.

# The role of missionaries in Africa was complex, with some being criticized for their ineffectiveness while others were praised for their dedication and positive impact.

The role of missionaries in Africa was complex, as highlighted by both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a nuanced view, acknowledging both the positive and negative aspects of missionary activities. Missionaries are credited with creating an educated African class, contributing to modernization through education and new technologies, spreading Christianity, and engaging in humanitarian efforts like fighting the Arab slave trade. However, they are also criticized for complicity in colonial expansion, cultural imperialism, and weakening African societies, making them more susceptible to colonial rule. Some missionaries focused more on conversion than on the well-being of the converted, while others lobbied for the protection of African communities, reflecting their dual role as agents of Western influence and reformers. Similarly, The African Times articles echo this complexity by criticizing some missionaries as "curious persons" or "awful duffers" who were ineffective, while praising others as devout and dedicated, such as Revs. Johnson, Beale, and Bishops Vidal from Sierra Leone and Lagos, for their positive impact. These observations collectively illustrate the diverse perceptions of missionaries, with some being criticized for ineffectiveness and others praised for their dedication and positive contributions, underscoring the multifaceted nature of their presence in Africa.

# The financial support for missionary activities in Lagos, Porto Novo, and the Popo country remained strong despite economic challenges.

The claim that financial support for missionary activities in Lagos, Porto Novo, and the Popo country remained strong despite economic challenges is addressed differently by the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not directly discuss the financial support for missionary activities in these regions or the economic challenges they faced. It focuses on various aspects of missionary work, such as the establishment of schools and churches and the influence of religious groups, but lacks explicit information about financial backing or economic conditions affecting these missions. This absence of direct evidence in the textbook suggests that the claim may not be substantiated by its content, which an expert historian might find significant when evaluating the claim's validity. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim, noting that despite a commercial depression caused by the threatened war in the interior of the Yoruba country, financial contributions, including annual subscriptions, class, and ticket-money, exceeded those of the previous year. The articles emphasize the gratitude expressed by his Excellency for the continued support and generosity of contributors, corroborating the claim of sustained financial backing for missionary activities in the region despite economic difficulties.

# The lenient punishment of European offenders in Africa contributed to ongoing exploitation and bitterness among the African population.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the lenient punishment of European offenders in Africa contributed to ongoing exploitation and bitterness among the African population. The General History of Africa highlights how colonial states maintained a monopoly over legal violence, often replacing employer-ordered whippings with judicial floggings, which were more prevalent than in Europe. This indicates a leniency towards European offenders, as the state sanctioned violence against Africans rather than punishing European employers for abuse. The text also describes the arbitrary actions of European overseers, brutal recruitment methods for forced labor, and preferential treatment for white immigrants, all contributing to exploitation and resentment among Africans. Although the textbook does not explicitly state that lenient punishment was a direct cause of ongoing exploitation, it illustrates a system where European offenders faced minimal consequences, perpetuating a sense of injustice and bitterness. Complementing this, The African Times articles detail a specific case involving Mr. Shanklin, a European found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to two years of penal servitude, yet released after only three weeks. This lenient enforcement disappointed the African community, who had hoped for a change in the treatment of European traders and merchants on the Niger. The articles emphasize the disparity in punishment between Europeans and Africans, aligning with the claim that such leniency fostered ongoing exploitation and bitterness. Additionally, the articles mention broader social tensions, such as dissensions between religious groups, further illustrating the complex social dynamics in the region. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of how lenient punishment of European offenders contributed to sustained exploitation and resentment among the African population.

# The conduct of some missionaries in Africa undermined the moral authority and credibility of the Church in local communities.

The observations from both the *General History of Africa* textbook and *The African Times* news articles provide compelling evidence that the conduct of some missionaries in Africa undermined the moral authority and credibility of the Church in local communities. The textbook highlights how missionaries often condemned traditional African practices, such as female initiation and other cultural rites, leading to tension and resistance. Their imposition of European cultural norms and denouncement of African religions as 'pagan' contributed to a perception of Christianity as a disintegrating force on African culture, resulting in opposition, including the establishment of independent schools and churches, and even violent protests. The missionaries' facilitation of colonialism and association with racial discrimination further eroded their moral authority, as their actions were seen as an affront to African identity and autonomy. Meanwhile, *The African Times* articles detail a specific incident involving a schoolmaster from the Church Missionary Society guilty of indecency, which sparked public indignation and raised concerns about the moral conduct of clergy. This incident underscored the importance of moral integrity among missionaries, as the community's perception of the Church's credibility was jeopardized. The call for the disconnection of the offending individual and acknowledgment of clergymen who lost sight of their sacred calling further illustrate how such actions led to a broader loss of trust and credibility in the Church's mission. Together, these sources underscore how the actions of certain missionaries significantly undermined the Church's moral authority in Africa.

# The expectation of resistance or difficulties from Africans in implementing changes.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced understanding of the expectation of resistance or difficulties from Africans in implementing changes. The General History of Africa offers substantial evidence supporting the claim, highlighting that many African leaders and authorities, such as Prempeh I of Asante and Wobogo, the Moro Naba, opposed colonial changes, rejecting European offers of protection and assistance. The Nandi in Kenya exemplify prolonged military resistance against British imperialism, demonstrating strong societal cohesion that enabled them to resist for over seven years. The text discusses various forms of resistance, including military confrontation, diplomatic efforts, and passive resistance, refuting colonial apologists' claims that African resistance was irrational or driven by superstition. Instead, it asserts that resistance was often powered by rational ideologies, critiquing the colonial historiographical view that Africans welcomed colonial rule. In contrast, The African Times articles acknowledge the anticipation of challenges, specifically mentioning difficulties arising from Africans themselves, suggesting an expectation of resistance or complications. However, they also highlight the potential for cooperation and the benefits of involving educated Africans in commerce and settlements, emphasizing the need for just and equitable treatment to secure cooperation. This presents a complex dynamic where both challenges and opportunities for collaboration exist, indicating that while resistance was anticipated, successful collaboration could be achieved under certain conditions. Together, these sources illustrate a multifaceted expectation of resistance, tempered by the possibility of cooperation if proper incentives and assurances were provided.

# The harsh climate in Africa significantly hindered missionary efforts, leading to numerous fatalities among missionaries.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the claim that the harsh climate in Africa significantly hindered missionary efforts, leading to numerous fatalities among missionaries. The textbook does not directly address this claim, instead focusing on socio-political and economic challenges faced by missionaries, such as the massacre of missionaries in Ujiji, rivalry between religious groups, the impact of the slave trade, European colonial interests, and interactions with local African societies. It notably lacks mention of climate-induced fatalities, suggesting that this aspect may not be a central theme in the historical narrative presented in this source. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing specific instances where the harsh climate led to missionary fatalities. They cite the death of Dr. Black at Livingstonia, Lake Nyassa, and the severe hardships faced by over forty missionaries in St. Paul de Loanda, South-west Africa, who suffered from fever shortly after arrival due to their unfamiliarity with local conditions. These articles emphasize the missionaries' lack of preparation and resources, which exacerbated their vulnerability to the climate, aligning with the claim by illustrating how the challenging environment contributed to their struggles and fatalities. However, the articles focus on particular instances rather than providing a comprehensive view of the climate's broader impact on missionary efforts across Africa.

# The involvement of European missionaries in Africa often led to significant cultural and religious changes in local communities.

The involvement of European missionaries in Africa often led to significant cultural and religious changes in local communities, as evidenced by both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights how missionaries established numerous schools, intertwining education with religious conversion, which facilitated the introduction of Christianity and European cultural practices, such as Western clothing and architecture. This led to the emergence of an educated African elite and contributed to the weakening of traditional African religious beliefs and social structures, as missionaries condemned practices like polygamy and ancestor worship. Additionally, missionaries promoted a money economy and introduced new crops, impacting both economic and cultural aspects of African societies. However, the textbook also notes that the impact of colonialism and missionary activities was not uniformly profound across Africa, with many traditional practices persisting, especially in rural areas, and mentions the syncretic blending of African and Christian religious practices. The African Times articles provide further support by detailing the arrival of missionaries from the Baptist Missionary Society in Fernando Po in 1841, who established mission stations, schools, churches, and used printing presses for translations, indicating efforts to spread Christianity and Western education. The presence of a missionary iron schooner underscores the organized nature of these missions, despite challenges such as death, discord, and the harsh African environment. While the articles do not explicitly discuss cultural and religious changes, the infrastructure and activities established by the missionaries imply such transformations. Together, these sources illustrate the transformative influence of European missionaries on African societies, while acknowledging the resilience and adaptation of local cultures.

# The presence of missionaries in Africa indicates a long-term commitment to religious and cultural exchange.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of a long-term commitment to religious and cultural exchange by missionaries in Africa. The textbook highlights the efforts of both black and white missionaries in establishing Christianity across various regions, such as the work of black American missionaries in the Congo and Nyasaland, and the establishment of missions by European denominations like the Presbyterian Church and the Basel Mission. These missions extended beyond evangelization to include education, agriculture, and the introduction of new technologies, indicating a broader cultural exchange. The involvement of Afro-Americans in missionary work and the establishment of indigenous Christian churches underscore a sustained commitment to religious exchange. However, the text also notes resistance to missionary efforts, with traditional African religions maintaining a strong presence and sometimes integrating with Christian practices, suggesting a complex and multifaceted cultural exchange. Additionally, the role of missionaries in facilitating colonial expansion complicates the narrative, intertwining religious and cultural exchange with political and economic interests. Meanwhile, The African Times articles provide evidence of the enduring presence of missionaries, with some serving between seventeen to thirty-five years, and the involvement of eight women for up to twenty-five years, demonstrating sustained commitment despite challenging conditions. The formation of an association in memory of Rev. John Alfred Robinson, who died while working for the Church Missionary Society in 1891, further indicates dedication to continuing his work, particularly in promoting the study of the Hausa language, reflecting an interest in cultural exchange and understanding. Together, these sources illustrate both the longevity of missionary presence and their engagement in cultural activities, such as language study, which are essential components of cultural exchange, while also highlighting the nuanced and sometimes contentious nature of these exchanges.

# The appointment of African clergymen in missionary roles in Africa could be more effective than European clergymen due to their resilience to the local climate and cultural familiarity.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that African clergymen could be more effective in missionary roles in Africa than their European counterparts due to their resilience to the local climate and cultural familiarity. The textbook highlights the advocacy of figures like James Johnson for the evangelization of Africa by Africans, emphasizing the need for an independent African Church staffed entirely by Africans. Johnson argued that European missionaries might not align with African racial ambitions and idiosyncrasies, potentially hindering the full development of Africans. This underscores the cultural familiarity and potential effectiveness of African clergymen, as demonstrated by successful black missionaries like Reverend William H. Sheppard, who attracted converts through cultural connections and understanding. However, the textbook does not explicitly address the resilience of African clergymen to the local climate. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific examples, such as Rev. Henry Johnson, an African clergyman of Yoruba descent, proposed for missionary work in Lagos. The articles emphasize that European clergymen often suffer from illness due to the climate, hindering their effectiveness, whereas African clergymen like Mr. Johnson are likely more acclimated to the environment and culturally connected to the local population. Additionally, the importance of language acquisition and cultural understanding in missionary work is highlighted, further supporting the idea that local clergymen could be more effective. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view that supports the claim, particularly in terms of cultural familiarity and, as noted by The African Times, climate resilience.

# The introduction and use of iron structures by European companies played a significant role in the establishment and expansion of colonial infrastructure in Africa.

The claim that the introduction and use of iron structures by European companies played a significant role in the establishment and expansion of colonial infrastructure in Africa is addressed differently by the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook primarily discusses the development of infrastructure such as railways, roads, and telegraph lines, focusing on their construction, ownership, and the economic and political impacts, but it does not specifically mention the use of iron structures. This absence suggests a gap in the specific detail of iron structures within the broader context of colonial infrastructure development, as the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim directly. In contrast, The African Times articles provide several details supporting the claim, highlighting the activities of Francis Morton & Company, a European firm known for designing and constructing iron roofs, buildings, and shedding. The articles emphasize the company's extensive experience and reputation, noting that renowned explorer H. M. Stanley utilized iron buildings by F. M. & Co. for his town of "Vivi," which he praised in his work "The Congo, and the Founding of its Free State." This suggests that iron structures were integral to colonial settlements. The articles also point out the advantages of these iron structures for export, such as their economy, ease of erection and removal, strength, low maintenance, and fireproof nature, making them appealing for colonial projects. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the broader impact of these structures on colonial expansion, leaving some aspects of the claim unaddressed. Overall, while the textbook lacks specific information on iron structures, The African Times provides evidence supporting their significant role, particularly through the example of H. M. Stanley's use of iron buildings in Africa.

# The construction of iron buildings facilitated the rapid establishment of colonial trading posts and administrative centers in Africa.

The claim that the construction of iron buildings facilitated the rapid establishment of colonial trading posts and administrative centers in Africa is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence supporting this claim, focusing instead on the development of infrastructure such as railways, roads, and telegraph lines, which were crucial for colonial administration and economic exploitation. It emphasizes urbanization, trade networks, and the establishment of new towns and administrative centers, but does not specifically mention iron buildings as a contributing factor. In contrast, The African Times articles offer substantial support for the claim, highlighting the work of Francis Morton and Company, Limited, which specialized in designing and constructing iron roofs and buildings for easy foreign erection. These structures, known for their durability, strength, and fireproof nature, were economical, quickly erected or removed, and required minimal maintenance, making them ideal for colonial settings. The articles cite the explorer H. M. Stanley's use of these iron buildings in his town of "Vivi," illustrating their role in establishing colonial infrastructure, particularly trading posts. However, the articles do not explicitly mention administrative centers, focusing more on trading stores and general construction advantages. This absence of direct reference to administrative centers is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, while the textbook does not address the role of iron buildings, The African Times provides evidence supporting their significance in the context of trading posts.

# The promotion of iron structures as fireproof and durable suggests a European perception of Africa as a challenging environment requiring robust solutions.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that the promotion of iron structures as fireproof and durable reflects a European perception of Africa as a challenging environment requiring robust solutions. The General History of Africa does not explicitly discuss iron structures in this context, focusing instead on the military, political, and economic dynamics between European powers and African societies during the colonial period. It highlights European technological and logistical advantages, such as advanced weaponry and infrastructure, without specifically mentioning iron structures or their necessity due to Africa's environment. The text emphasizes European strategic and military superiority, the impact of the industrial revolution, and African resistance and adaptation strategies, thus not addressing this particular aspect of European architectural or engineering strategies in Africa. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the promotion of iron structures as fireproof and durable, aligning with a European perception of Africa as a challenging environment. The articles highlight the strength, durability, and fireproof nature of iron buildings by F. M. & Co., noting their suitability for export to Africa and the satisfaction of explorer H. M. Stanley with these structures for his town of "Vivi." However, the articles do not explicitly state that these features are designed to address African environmental challenges, focusing instead on the general advantages of iron structures, such as economical construction and ease of erection and removal, without directly linking these benefits to the African context. This absence of explicit connection to Africa's environment is an interesting divergence from the claim.

# The economic and logistical advantages of iron buildings may have contributed to the European perception of Africa as a land of opportunity for resource exploitation and settlement.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer distinct perspectives on the claim that the economic and logistical advantages of iron buildings may have contributed to the European perception of Africa as a land of opportunity for resource exploitation and settlement. The General History of Africa does not explicitly address the role of iron buildings in shaping European perceptions. Instead, it focuses on the discovery and exploitation of mineral resources, the influx of European capital and technical personnel, and the development of infrastructure like railways and roads in response to mining activities. It underscores the monopolization of African resources by European powers and the exclusion of Africans from benefiting from their own mineral wealth, without specifically linking these developments to iron buildings. In contrast, The African Times articles highlight the practical benefits of F. M. & Co.'s iron buildings, noting their economical nature, quick erection and removal, strength, durability, and fireproof qualities, which made them advantageous for export and use in foreign territories, including Africa. The articles mention explorer H. M. Stanley's use of these structures in his town of "Vivi," suggesting their role in facilitating European activities in Africa. However, they do not explicitly discuss the broader implications of these advantages in terms of resource exploitation or settlement, nor do they directly address the European perception of Africa. Thus, while the articles provide evidence of the practical benefits of iron buildings, neither source directly links these benefits to the European perception of Africa as a land of opportunity, highlighting a notable difference in focus between the two.

# The advertisement for galvanized corrugated iron roofs and buildings indicates the importance of durable and quickly assembled infrastructure in colonial Africa, reflecting the needs of European settlers and explorers.

The claim that the advertisement for galvanized corrugated iron roofs and buildings indicates the importance of durable and quickly assembled infrastructure in colonial Africa is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. While the General History of Africa does not explicitly mention galvanized corrugated iron roofs and buildings, it emphasizes the significance of infrastructure development in colonial Africa, particularly in the context of railways, roads, and other facilities essential for the economic activities of European settlers and explorers. The need for durable and quickly assembled infrastructure is implied through discussions of the rapid construction of transport networks and the establishment of administrative and commercial facilities, driven by the economic interests of colonizers, such as resource extraction and trade facilitation. This aligns with the claim's focus on the needs of European settlers and explorers for durable structures. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly highlight the advertisement for galvanized corrugated iron roofs and buildings, underscoring their importance by emphasizing their economical nature, ease of erection and removal, strength, and fireproof qualities, which were crucial for the challenging environments faced by settlers and explorers. The reference to Mr. H. M. Stanley, a renowned explorer, and his satisfaction with the iron buildings constructed by Francis Morton & Co. for his town of Vivi, further underscores the relevance of such infrastructure. However, the articles focus more on the technical and practical benefits of the iron structures, without explicitly addressing the broader context of European colonial activities or the specific needs of settlers, suggesting a more commercial and technical perspective rather than a political or social one.

# The health challenges faced by European officials in Africa during the colonial period highlight the difficulties of colonial administration due to harsh climate and demanding conditions.

The health challenges faced by European officials in Africa during the colonial period underscore the difficulties of colonial administration due to harsh climates and demanding conditions, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides detailed evidence of these challenges, noting the high mortality rates among Europeans due to indigenous diseases, with European soldiers in British West African forces experiencing death rates nine times higher than their African counterparts. This reflects the broader difficulties of colonial administration in such environments. Additionally, the text points out that Europe was not well-prepared medically for its African ventures, with life expectancy in Britain being less than 40 years at the start of the nineteenth century and slow progress in addressing tropical diseases like malaria and yellow fever until the late nineteenth century. The establishment of tropical medical schools in Europe and Africa further illustrates the significant health challenges faced by colonial administrations. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide a specific example of Deputy Surgeon-General E. M. Sinclair, who had to return to England due to health issues worsened by the demanding duties and climate in South Africa. This example aligns with the claim by illustrating the adverse effects of the harsh climate on European officials, although the articles lack additional examples or broader context, suggesting that the health challenges of European officials were not a primary focus of news coverage at the time. Together, these sources highlight the significant impact of the African environment on European colonial officials and the complexities it introduced to colonial administration.

# The severe drought in the Cape Colony had a devastating impact on agriculture, leading to significant financial losses for farmers.

The claim that a severe drought in the Cape Colony had a devastating impact on agriculture, leading to significant financial losses for farmers, is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles provide detailed accounts of how the ongoing drought severely affected agriculture, causing substantial losses for farmers. They describe entire districts as parched and lacking grass and water, which exacerbated distress among laborers and led to alarming destitution levels. The articles emphasize the reliance of South African colonists on rainfall for crops and livestock, noting that the scarcity of rain often resulted in crop failures and the death of sheep in large numbers. This situation forced the colony to import significant quantities of cereals and other foodstuffs, highlighting a failure in local agricultural production and underscoring the financial losses by necessitating the importation of goods like butter, cheese, and salted meats that should have been produced locally. In contrast, the General History of Africa does not mention a severe drought in the Cape Colony but instead focuses on other challenges faced by farmers, such as economic difficulties of the 1820 settlers, labor shortages, and the impact of the Mfecane on labor availability. It also notes floods in 1822 that destroyed crops, but not a drought, with a greater emphasis on socio-economic and labor issues rather than climatic events. This absence of information about a severe drought in the textbook highlights a notable difference between the claim and its content.

# The presence of the Tsetse fly was a significant concern for agricultural development in Africa during the 19th century.

The presence of the tsetse fly was a significant concern for agricultural development in Africa during the 19th century, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details how the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals across most of tropical Africa, which were essential for moving goods and facilitating agricultural activities. This limitation necessitated human porterage, significantly impacting labor dynamics and agricultural productivity. Additionally, the association of the tsetse fly with sleeping sickness, affecting both humans and animals, further complicated agricultural development. In Southern Africa, its presence in sweetveld areas impacted pasturage and livestock rearing. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the critical role of the tsetse fly in agricultural planning, as illustrated by Charles Locher's letter emphasizing the need to identify the fly before establishing a model farm on the Gold Coast. The request to have fly samples examined to determine the presence of the tsetse fly underscores its influence on decision-making regarding farm locations. Both sources align in illustrating how the tsetse fly posed significant challenges to agricultural practices and development in various regions of Africa during the 19th century.

# High mortality rates on Coolie emigrant ships highlight the dangerous and often deadly conditions faced by laborers during their voyages.

The claim regarding high mortality rates on Coolie emigrant ships, highlighting the dangerous and often deadly conditions faced by laborers during their voyages, is supported by observations from The African Times but not specifically addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times provides detailed accounts, such as the tragic journey of the ship Fusileer, which was wrecked at Port Natal while traveling from Calcutta to Demerara. Out of 568 passengers, 169 died from fever, 77 were sick with fever upon landing, and 20 drowned, leaving only 302 in good health. These statistics underscore the perilous conditions and high mortality rates associated with such voyages, reinforcing the claim about the dangers faced by Coolie laborers. In contrast, the General History of Africa focuses on the mortality rates and harsh conditions experienced by African laborers during colonial times, particularly those working on railways, plantations, and in mines, due to diseases, malnutrition, and poor working conditions. However, it does not mention Coolie emigrant ships or the specific conditions faced by laborers during their voyages, indicating a gap in the textbook's coverage of labor migration and associated risks, which could be of interest to historians studying labor movements across different regions and groups.

# The presence of numerous old gold workings in the Hartley Hills area indicates a long history of mining activity, suggesting the region's historical economic importance.

The claim regarding the historical economic importance of the Hartley Hills area due to its long history of mining activity is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences in focus and detail. The General History of Africa does not specifically mention the Hartley Hills or provide direct evidence of old gold workings there. However, it discusses historical mining activities in regions like Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where gold was mined and worked by the local population for generations before the colonial era. This context aligns with the claim of historical economic importance due to mining, highlighting the significance of gold mining in areas such as the Gold Coast and Southern Rhodesia. The absence of specific mention of Hartley Hills suggests that the claim may pertain to a more localized or less documented aspect of African mining history. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details that directly support the claim, mentioning numerous old workings in the Hartley Hills and considerable activity by prospectors, indicating the region's economic significance. The articles also reference Sir John Swinburne's engineer reporting payable gold in the area twenty years ago, further supporting the notion of historical economic importance. However, they lack specific historical timelines or detailed accounts of the mining activities, which is a notable difference from the claim. Together, these sources offer a complementary perspective, with the textbook providing broader historical context and the articles offering localized evidence, albeit with limited historical detail.

# The destruction caused by grasshoppers in the American Midwest highlights the vulnerability of agricultural societies to insect plagues, a challenge also faced by African communities throughout history.

The claim that the destruction caused by grasshoppers in the American Midwest highlights the vulnerability of agricultural societies to insect plagues is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences in focus. The General History of Africa does not explicitly mention grasshoppers or insect plagues as challenges faced by African communities, which contrasts with the detailed accounts of such events in the American Midwest. However, the textbook does discuss various ecological and epidemiological challenges, such as droughts, famines, and diseases like smallpox, cholera, and sleeping sickness, which similarly underscore the vulnerability of agricultural societies to natural calamities. Additionally, the impact of the slave trade and wars on population stability further exacerbated these difficulties. Meanwhile, The African Times articles vividly describe the extensive destruction caused by grasshoppers in the Midwest, particularly in Kansas and Missouri, where crops like wheat, oats, corn, and small fruits were annihilated, and growing trees were damaged. This aligns with the claim regarding the vulnerability of agricultural societies to insect plagues. However, the articles do not mention African communities or draw direct comparisons to their experiences with insect plagues, highlighting a gap in the narrative that could enrich the understanding of global agricultural challenges. Overall, while both sources illustrate the vulnerability of agricultural societies to environmental pressures, the specific challenge of insect plagues in African contexts remains underexplored.

# The differential impact of diseases on African and European populations is highlighted by reports of smallpox affecting natives in Accra while Europeans remained healthy.

The claim that smallpox affected natives in Accra while Europeans remained healthy is addressed differently in the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information about smallpox affecting natives in Accra while Europeans remained healthy. Instead, it discusses the broader impact of diseases like smallpox and cholera on African populations, emphasizing their vulnerability due to a lack of natural immunity and the devastating effects of epidemics. The textbook also notes high mortality rates among European colonizers due to indigenous diseases, indicating that Europeans were not immune to health challenges in Africa. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by reporting that in Accra, smallpox was destroying the native population while Europeans remained healthy, aligning with the assertion of a differential impact. The articles also mention smallpox affecting the colored population at Fernando Po without noting any impact on Europeans, further suggesting a differential impact, although they lack specific information on European health in Fernando Po during the outbreak. Together, these sources present a nuanced view, with the textbook highlighting general disease impacts on both populations, while the news articles provide specific instances supporting the claim of differential disease impact in certain regions.

# The maritime routes off the coast of Sierra Leone require improved safety measures due to repeated losses of steamships on Carpenter's Rock and the absence of a lighthouse posing significant risks.

The claim that the maritime routes off the coast of Sierra Leone require improved safety measures due to repeated losses of steamships on Carpenter's Rock and the absence of a lighthouse posing significant risks is supported by observations from The African Times but not addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles provide specific details that corroborate the claim, highlighting the repeated loss of steamships, such as the Monrovia, on Carpenter's Rock and emphasizing the absence of a lighthouse as a significant risk factor. The articles suggest delaying departures from Sierra Leone by twelve hours to ensure safer passage during daylight, underscoring the need for improved safety measures. In contrast, the General History of Africa textbook does not contain specific information related to these maritime safety issues. It focuses instead on broader themes such as infrastructure development, colonial trade impacts, and socio-political dynamics, without mentioning Carpenter's Rock or navigational hazards. This absence of detail in the textbook suggests a gap in addressing certain navigational challenges significant to Sierra Leone's maritime history, highlighting a difference between the claim and the textbook's content.

# The significant role of maritime trade between Britain and Africa during the 19th century is underscored by the activities of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the construction and deployment of multiple steamships for the West African route.

The significant role of maritime trade between Britain and Africa during the 19th century is well-documented through observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines, such as the British African Company and the African Steam-Ship Company, which replaced slave ships and facilitated trade between Brazil and West Africa, particularly Lagos. By 1900, British shipping, dominated by the Elder Dempster Line and Co Ltd, controlled the West African maritime field, underscoring the importance of this trade route. However, the textbook does not specifically mention the British and African Steam Navigation Company. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on this company's activities, detailing the deployment of multiple steamships like the Bonny, Roquelle, and Congo for the West African route. These articles highlight the company's commitment to establishing a robust maritime connection, with the Bonny's challenging voyage and the Roquelle's swift journey from Glasgow to Liverpool exemplifying the resilience of these operations. The construction of these steamships by Messrs. Randolph, Elder, and Co. of Glasgow, and the anticipation of the Congo's upcoming voyage, reflect ongoing investment in maritime infrastructure. While the articles emphasize the strategic importance of maritime trade, they do not delve into the broader economic impact or specific nature of the trade, which the claim implies. Together, these sources corroborate the claim about the significance of maritime trade and the use of steamships, while each provides unique insights into the operations and companies involved.

# The arbitration decision in the Delagoa Bay case reflects a broader bias against British territorial claims in international disputes.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about the Delagoa Bay arbitration case or any broader bias against British territorial claims in international disputes. Instead, it focuses on various territorial disputes and treaties involving British interests in Africa, such as the annexation of Griqualand West, the Anglo-German delimitation treaty, and the Berlin Conference's impact on African partitioning. These examples illustrate British involvement in territorial negotiations and conflicts but do not directly address the Delagoa Bay case or suggest a pattern of bias against British claims. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim of a broader bias against British territorial claims in international disputes. The articles express skepticism about the impartiality of foreign arbitrators, suggesting that it is almost impossible for them to rule in favor of Great Britain due to a "bitter feeling" against Britain's extensive global possessions. This sentiment aligns with the claim of a bias in arbitration decisions. Additionally, the articles criticize the decision to refer the Delagoa Bay dispute to arbitration, implying that such processes often result in unfavorable outcomes for Britain. The articles also mention that the decision was made on technical grounds, which could be interpreted as a way to sidestep Britain's claims. However, the articles do not provide concrete evidence of bias in this specific case, focusing instead on the broader context of international arbitration involving British interests. This lack of specific evidence in the Delagoa Bay case itself is a notable difference from the claim, which suggests a direct bias in this particular decision.

# The British Government's decision to refer the Delagoa Bay dispute to arbitration was criticized as unnecessary and potentially harmful to the interests of its South African colonies.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about the Delagoa Bay dispute or the British Government's decision to refer it to arbitration, focusing instead on the broader context of British imperialism in Southern Africa, such as territorial disputes and efforts to establish a federation. This absence of information suggests that the textbook does not address this particular aspect of British colonial policy, leaving the claim about the criticism of the arbitration decision unsupported by its details. In contrast, The African Times news articles offer several details supporting the claim that the British Government's decision was criticized as unnecessary and potentially harmful to its South African colonies. The articles express regret over the decision, viewing it as a needless risk that jeopardized future interests of the colonies. They argue that Portugal had no valid claim to the territory, making the arbitration an unnecessary courting of injustice, and warn that it could lead to future conflict or unjust exaction. The articles emphasize that the British Government should have prioritized the future expansion of the South African colonies and note that Portugal was not prepared to utilize the territory effectively, indicating no immediate material interests were at risk. This aligns with the claim that the arbitration was unnecessary and potentially detrimental to British colonial interests in the region.

# The British believed they had a right to control the Congo due to their contributions to its exploration and development.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that the British believed they had a right to control the Congo due to their contributions to its exploration and development. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence supporting this claim, focusing instead on British involvement in Africa through treaties, protectorates, and colonial administration, without specifically mentioning British claims to the Congo based on exploration or development. The text highlights King Leopold of Belgium's role in the Congo, the establishment of the Congo Free State, and the involvement of other European powers, while noting British interests in strategic locations like Egypt and the Suez Canal. In contrast, The African Times articles offer several details supporting the claim, emphasizing that it was an Englishman, Livingstone, who discovered the Congo River, and that Anglo-American and international funds, including English investments, were crucial in exploring and publicizing the river. The articles also highlight the significant role of English goods and products in winning the affection of the Congo nation and argue against Portuguese control, suggesting a British moral obligation to protect the region from Portuguese exploitation. They express a strong sentiment that the British should maintain influence over the Congo to ensure its development and protect their trade interests, reinforcing the belief in their right to control the region. These differing accounts illustrate a notable divergence between the textbook content and the perspective presented in the news articles.

# The British government consistently opposed Portugal's claim to the Congo, supporting the idea of free trade and commerce in the region.

The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information directly related to the British government's stance on Portugal's claim to the Congo or its support for free trade and commerce in the region. While it discusses various aspects of European colonialism in Africa, including the manipulation of trade and debt by European powers and Britain's global hegemony in enforcing free trade principles, it notably lacks coverage of the British opposition to Portugal's claims in the Congo. In contrast, The African Times news article provides detailed support for the claim that the British government consistently opposed Portugal's claim to the Congo, advocating for free trade and commerce in the region. It highlights Mr. Jacob Bright, M.P.'s assertion that the British government had denied Portugal's right to the Congo territory for fifty years, regardless of the political party in power, due to Portugal's lack of connection with the region. The article emphasizes that the Congo was open to commerce by various European nations, which would have been stifled under Portuguese control, and criticizes Portugal's colonial practices for hindering trade. Additionally, it notes that the British government made treaties with local chiefs, opposing any Portuguese jurisdiction that might disrupt these agreements. Thus, while the textbook omits this specific aspect of colonial history, The African Times article illustrates the British government's long-standing influence in keeping the Congo region open for international trade, opposing Portuguese annexation efforts.

# The International Association aimed to establish a powerful and independent state in the Congo, potentially a confederation of free native states, to protect against external threats and promote commerce.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim regarding the International Association's aims in the Congo. The textbook does not provide direct information about the Association's intention to establish a powerful and independent state or a confederation of free native states in the Congo. Instead, it focuses on the initial peaceful submission and subsequent resistance of Central African societies to colonial rule, the manipulation of African economies by European powers under the guise of free trade, and the rise of African nationalism and anti-colonial movements. The text emphasizes colonial exploitation and resistance dynamics, without mentioning any protective or commercial objectives by the International Association. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing Mr. H. M. Stanley's mission as the chief agent of the International Association, which involved establishing stations along the River Congo and extending the Association's influence. The articles describe the goal of organizing these districts into a powerful and independent state, potentially a confederation of free native states, to protect against marauders, filibusters, and slave-hunters, and to promote commerce. They also highlight concerns about Portuguese rule threatening the Association's settlements and commercial interests, underscoring the need for an independent state. Thus, while the textbook emphasizes resistance and exploitation, the news articles align with the claim of establishing a state for protection and commercial benefits.

# The International Association's efforts to improve communication and commerce in the Congo Basin highlight the economic motivations behind European involvement in Africa.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the economic motivations behind European involvement in the Congo Basin, particularly through the efforts of the International Association. The General History of Africa highlights the role of European commercial firms in expanding trade and connecting Africa with Western markets, emphasizing the establishment of trading posts and mission stations to control trade routes and resources. It also discusses King Leopold's establishment of his personal empire in the Congo, driven by a desire to control resources and trade, following the Brussels conference initially intended for peaceful cooperation and commerce development. However, the textbook also notes strategic interests and the abolition of the slave trade as additional motivations. Similarly, The African Times articles underscore the economic interests by detailing the Association's significant financial investment, nearly half a million sterling, to secure equal rights and freedom of commerce for merchants, and the construction of a railway to facilitate trade. The articles also mention the Berlin Conference's decision to grant the Association free access to the sea, ensuring viable trade routes. Yet, they frame these efforts within a philanthropic context, suggesting a dual narrative of economic and civilizational aims. Together, these sources support the claim of economic motivations while presenting a more complex picture that includes strategic, humanitarian, and civilizational factors.

# The Portuguese were actively seeking to expand their colonial influence in the Congo region before the Berlin Conference concluded.

The claim that the Portuguese were actively seeking to expand their colonial influence in the Congo region before the Berlin Conference concluded is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some nuances. The General History of Africa textbook provides a broader context of Portuguese colonial ambitions in Africa, noting their proactive stance following a late invitation to the Brussels conference in 1876, which led to territorial annexations in Mozambique by 1880. However, it does not provide direct evidence of Portuguese activities specifically targeting the Congo region before the Berlin Conference, instead highlighting King Leopold of Belgium's initiatives that resulted in the creation of the Congo Free State. In contrast, The African Times articles offer more direct support for the claim, detailing Portuguese efforts in the weeks leading up to the Berlin Conference's conclusion. These efforts included securing treaties with native chiefs at Loango, Landana, and Banana, potentially securing the coastline between Rudofstadt and Banana, and deploying Portuguese men-of-war along the coast and up the Congo River. The articles also mention British protests against these actions, underscoring the contentious nature of Portuguese activities. Together, these sources suggest that while the Portuguese were broadly active in expanding their colonial reach in Africa, specific efforts in the Congo region are more explicitly documented in The African Times than in the General History of Africa textbook.

# The introduction of steamships marked a significant advancement in maritime technology, facilitating more efficient trade and communication between Britain and the West Coast of Africa.

The introduction of steamships marked a significant advancement in maritime technology, facilitating more efficient trade and communication between Britain and the West Coast of Africa, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines, such as the British African Company and the African Steam-Ship Company, which replaced slave ships and facilitated legitimate trade between ports like Bahía de Todos os Santos and Lagos. This shift towards more efficient trade routes was supported by the use of steamships, with the Elder Dempster Line and Co Ltd dominating shipping in British West Africa by 1900, underscoring the importance of maritime technology in enhancing trade efficiency. However, the textbook does not explicitly state that steamships were a significant technological advancement or directly link them to improved communication. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim by detailing the launch and voyages of steamships like the Bonny, Roquelle, and Congo, part of the British and African Steam Navigation Company. These steamships, designed for trade between Glasgow, Liverpool, and key West African ports, demonstrated resilience in adverse conditions and facilitated regular, structured services. The regular scheduling of steamship departures from Liverpool and their expanded reach to ports along the West Coast of Africa, including Madeira and the Canary Islands, further illustrate the enhanced efficiency and connectivity enabled by steamship technology. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of how steamships transformed maritime trade and communication between Britain and Africa.

# The presence of regular steamship routes between Britain and Africa in the 19th century facilitated increased communication and trade between the two regions.

The presence of regular steamship routes between Britain and Africa in the 19th century played a significant role in facilitating increased communication and trade between the two regions, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of regular mixed cargo and passenger lines, such as the British African Company and the African Steam-Ship Company, which replaced slave ships and facilitated trade between Brazil and the west coast of Africa. This shift towards more structured maritime routes likely included connections between Britain and Africa, contributing to the expansion of European trade in Africa, which relied on pre-existing local and regional trade patterns. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention steamship routes between Britain and Africa. In contrast, The African Times provides specific details about the Royal Mail Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, both of which operated regular steamship services between Liverpool and various ports on the West Coast of Africa. The Royal Mail Steamship Company had a bi-monthly mail dispatch schedule, with a noted exception in August, while the British and African Steam Navigation Company dispatched steamers on the 6th and 18th of each month, adjusting if these dates fell on a Monday. These structured routes facilitated the shipping of goods such as African gold ornaments, ice, and machinery for Africa or India, underscoring the active trade enabled by these steamship connections. Together, these sources support the claim of increased communication and trade between Britain and Africa, highlighting the role of regular steamship routes in this development.

# The introduction of organized European gold mining companies in West Africa marked a significant shift in the region's economic landscape, potentially accelerating its economic progress.

The introduction of organized European gold mining companies in West Africa marked a significant shift in the region's economic landscape, with both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles providing insights into its impact. The General History of Africa highlights that during the colonial period, the mining industry, particularly gold mining, experienced substantial growth, with the Gold Coast (now Ghana) seeing minerals, mostly gold, contributing over 40% of the total value of domestic exports between 1905 and 1909. This indicates a shift in the economic landscape, aligning with the claim that organized European mining activities accelerated economic progress. However, the textbook also notes that the benefits were not equitably distributed, as profits were largely repatriated to Europe, and African participation in the industry was limited due to legislative measures favoring imperialist interests. In contrast, The African Times emphasizes the potential economic benefits of organized gold mining, noting its contribution to steamship freight and passenger accommodation and predicting that it would attract further investment, leading to infrastructure development such as railways and expanded trade opportunities. While the article suggests that gold mining could be a catalyst for broader economic development, it does not address potential negative impacts or challenges, which could be a point of difference for historians examining the full scope of economic changes in West Africa during this period. Together, these observations suggest that while organized European gold mining marked a significant economic shift, the extent to which it accelerated economic progress for the local population remains debatable.

# The lack of proper transportation infrastructure, such as railways, significantly hindered the economic potential of regions like the Gold Coast and Lagos.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the impact of transportation infrastructure on the economic potential of regions like the Gold Coast and Lagos. The General History of Africa highlights that colonial transportation infrastructure, such as railways and roads, was primarily designed to facilitate resource extraction and connect production areas to the global market, rather than to promote overall economic development or inter-African connectivity. This supports the claim that inadequate transportation infrastructure hindered economic potential. However, the textbook also notes that the arrival of railways in regions like Lagos significantly accelerated the expansion of industries, such as the groundnut industry, and that the Gold Coast's cocoa belt was well-served by railways, suggesting that some regions did benefit from transportation infrastructure. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the absence of adequate roads and the reliance on native porters for transporting goods, which was costly and inefficient, with the cost of transporting a ton of produce over forty to fifty miles estimated at £10, compared to £1 with railways. This inefficiency limited the distance heavier produce could be conveyed and resulted in significant waste. The articles also highlight the need for railways to improve trade and economic development, noting that while steamship companies provided sufficient ocean facilities, river and inland transportation were lacking. Furthermore, they mention that other colonial powers, such as France, Belgium, and Portugal, were already constructing railways in their territories, putting British West African colonies at a competitive disadvantage. Together, these sources provide a nuanced perspective that acknowledges both the limitations and benefits of colonial transportation infrastructure, while underscoring the significant hindrances posed by inadequate infrastructure in certain regions.

# The development of infrastructure, such as railways, was considered a sign of advancing civilization in British colonies.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles both address the claim that the development of infrastructure, such as railways, was considered a sign of advancing civilization in British colonies, albeit from slightly different perspectives. The "General History of Africa" highlights the extensive construction of railways and roads in various British colonies, such as South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, Nigeria, and Egypt, primarily to facilitate the extraction and export of resources like minerals and cash crops. This infrastructure development was often portrayed as a positive impact of colonial rule, contributing to economic growth and modernization. However, the text emphasizes that these developments primarily served the interests of the colonial powers rather than the local populations, with infrastructure often inadequate for the needs of the colonized people and focused on promoting British economic interests. It also notes that infrastructure facilitated the movement of goods and people, reducing parochialism and supporting urban growth, but the primary motivation was economic exploitation rather than the advancement of civilization for the benefit of the colonized regions. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by highlighting the belief that infrastructure, such as the railway from Bushua to Tacquah, was seen as beneficial for economic progress and civilization on the Gold Coast. The articles reflect opinions, such as those of Mr. C. M'Arthur, emphasizing the necessity of railways in West African colonies to prevent isolation from their natural hinterland and to protect British trade interests. Both sources underscore the perception that railways were crucial for economic development and civilization, aligning with the claim, but the textbook provides a more nuanced perspective, indicating that the primary motivation was economic exploitation rather than genuine advancement for the colonized regions.

# The construction of railways in West Africa was seen as crucial for expanding British trade and countering French influence in the region.

The construction of railways in West Africa was seen as crucial for expanding British trade, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, though they emphasize different aspects of the claim. The General History of Africa underscores the strategic importance of railways in facilitating the evacuation of exports, aligning with British interests in enhancing trade routes from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. This focus on economic expansion and the development of export sectors, such as the groundnut industry in Nigeria, supports the notion that railways were vital for trade growth. However, the textbook does not explicitly link railway construction to countering French influence, instead noting the rivalry between Britain and France in trade and political control in areas like Lagos and Porto Novo without directly connecting it to railways. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim by detailing how railways were seen as essential for counteracting French efforts to divert trade to their ports. Mr. Hutton from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce emphasized the need for new markets and the extension of old ones, arguing that railways would attract trade to the cheapest routes and prevent France or Germany from capturing key markets. Mr. M'Arthur from Liverpool highlighted the high cost of transport due to inadequate infrastructure, which restricted trade to the coast and left the interior undeveloped, suggesting that railways could significantly boost trade, such as rubber exports. Together, these sources illustrate the dual role of railways in expanding British trade and, as per The African Times, countering French influence in the region.

# The actions of white traders and European officials were seen as corrupting and demoralizing to African natives.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the actions of white traders and European officials were seen as corrupting and demoralizing to African natives. The textbook details how European traders manipulated African rulers into debt, undermining their autonomy and leading to economic exploitation. The imposition of colonial rule brought about forced labor, land alienation, and the suppression of traditional beliefs, which demoralized African societies. Racial discrimination and the imposition of European cultural norms further humiliated Africans, fostering a sense of inferiority. The exploitative colonial economy forced Africans to produce goods they did not consume and consume goods they did not produce, leading to economic dependency and social inequality. Additionally, the cultural devastation caused by the slave trade and colonialism disrupted African social and artistic patterns. Similarly, The African Times articles describe the negative influence of white traders, particularly those pursuing ostrich feathers, whose disgraceful conduct was morally corrupting to the natives. The traders exploited the lack of law to engage in swindling and falsehood, ruining both soul and body. A letter from Samuel Blackall acknowledges the demoralizing effect of the "reign of terror" on the population, suggesting that European actions provoked civil unrest and legal disputes. John Carr's letter further describes West African traders as brutal and degraded, with a lasting negative influence on the natives. Together, these observations illustrate how European actions systematically undermined African economic, social, and cultural structures, reinforcing the perception of corruption and demoralization among African natives.

# The legal and administrative systems in colonial Africa often failed to hold Europeans accountable for their actions.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the legal and administrative systems in colonial Africa often failed to hold Europeans accountable for their actions. The General History of Africa highlights the paternalistic and authoritarian nature of colonial administration, which was designed to maintain European dominance and control over African populations. This system was characterized by racial discrimination and a lack of political power for Africans, as evidenced by the electoral systems in Algeria and South Africa, where Africans had little to no representation. The imposition of European bureaucratic structures often distorted and weakened African institutions, further entrenching European control. Additionally, the exploitation and manipulation of African resources and labor, with Europeans occupying fertile lands and monopolizing trade, often to the detriment of African communities, suggest a legal and administrative framework that prioritized European interests and overlooked exploitative actions. The African Times articles provide specific instances that illustrate this lack of accountability, such as the case of Pritchard, who was accused of causing a crew member's death through ill-treatment but was discharged due to insufficient evidence. Similarly, the case of John William Shankling, a European captain charged with the murder or manslaughter of a crew member, highlights the uncertainty and potential leniency in legal proceedings, as the article does not provide a resolution to the case. The behavior of Samuel Rigby Staniforth, who greeted the accused warmly in court, further implies a lack of seriousness in addressing the charges. While the articles mention that legal proceedings were initiated, indicating some attempt to address these issues, the overall pattern reflects a system where Europeans were not fully held accountable, aligning with the claim.

# European commercial enterprises and trading companies in Africa were often exploitative and faced criticism.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view that supports the claim that European commercial enterprises and trading companies in Africa were often exploitative and faced criticism. The General History of Africa highlights the exploitative tendencies of European firms, noting their appropriation of surplus generated by peasant production through unequal exchange, paying little for produce while charging high prices for imported goods. This practice mirrors the experiences of Latin American peasants, indicating a broader pattern of exploitation. The text also discusses how European traders undermined African economies by manipulating debt and trade agreements to their advantage, weakening African rulers' control over their economies. Criticism of European enterprises is evident in the scandalous forced labor practices in King Leopold's Congo Free State, which necessitated reforms to appease liberal opinion in Europe. Furthermore, European firms transitioned from wholesale to retail, cutting out African middlemen and limiting African access to capital and loans, further impeding African economic development. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight allegations of gross brutality by the subordinate officers of the steamship Norway towards colored persons, suggesting a pattern of mistreatment and abuse by European companies. The articles criticize the West African steamers for their inhuman treatment of Kroomen and the lack of decent accommodation for second-class passengers, indicating a disregard for African welfare. Additionally, the high-handed and cruel treatment by the French Company trading up the River Niger further illustrates exploitative practices. The call for a mixed Consular Court to address these issues reflects the criticism and demand for accountability faced by these companies. Together, these observations depict European enterprises as engaging in exploitative behavior and receiving significant criticism for their actions in Africa.

# The presence and actions of European traders and officials contributed to moral decline and safety issues in African regions.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that the presence and actions of European traders and officials contributed to moral decline and safety issues in African regions. The General History of Africa highlights how European settlers occupied fertile lands, displacing Africans and monopolizing trade, which led to economic and social tensions. The introduction of European-planned taxes and commercialization of land disrupted traditional African institutions, causing widespread poverty. The imposition of European cultural norms and the denigration of African culture further contributed to a sense of inferiority among Africans. European intervention exacerbated instability, with punitive expeditions and revolts leading to significant loss of life and disruption of subsistence farming. The intensified slave trade due to European demand also led to social upheavals and increased hostility among African communities. Similarly, The African Times articles describe the negative impact of "half European influence," characterized by recklessness and tyranny, leading to moral degradation and decreased safety of life and property. European agents undermined the traditional Egbo system, crucial for maintaining order and protecting the weak and poor, while missionaries withheld knowledge and education, further contributing to societal decline. The articles also depict past West African traders as brutal and degraded, with their actions having a lasting negative influence on the natives. Together, these sources illustrate how European actions undermined African societies' moral and social fabric, leading to safety issues and a decline in traditional values.

# The ivory trade was a significant economic activity in West Africa, involving regions such as Gaboon, Ambriz, Cameroon, and Angola.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the significance of the ivory trade in West Africa. The textbook does not provide direct evidence to support the claim that the ivory trade was a significant economic activity in West Africa, specifically in regions such as Gaboon, Ambriz, Cameroon, and Angola. It primarily focuses on the ivory trade in Central and East Africa, highlighting its importance in regions like Central Africa and its connection to the Swahili network and the Great Lakes region. Angola is mentioned in the context of the Portuguese-African trade network and the slave trade, rather than ivory. This absence of information on the specified West African regions suggests a discrepancy between the claim and the textbook's content. In contrast, The African Times news articles offer substantial evidence supporting the claim, detailing various sales and prices of ivory from West African regions, including Gaboon, Ambriz, Cameroon, and Angola. The articles describe the quality and pricing of ivory, indicating a well-established trade with a focus on market value. The mention of competitive sales and price fluctuations further underscores the economic significance of the ivory trade in these regions, providing detailed insights into its dynamics and supporting its importance in West Africa.

# The classification and pricing of ivory suggest a complex market system that valued certain qualities over others, indicating a developed understanding of the product's worth.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting levels of detail regarding the classification and pricing of ivory, which relate to the claim about a complex market system valuing certain qualities over others. The textbook highlights the significant role of ivory in trade, particularly in East-Central Africa, and its increased demand in markets such as Britain, the USA, and Asia. However, it does not provide specific details on how ivory was classified or priced based on its qualities, nor does it discuss a developed understanding of the product's worth through specific market mechanisms. Instead, it focuses on the expansion of trade networks and the economic impact of the ivory trade, indicating a gap in the discussion of the market system's complexity. In contrast, The African Times news articles offer detailed classifications and pricing of ivory, supporting the claim of a complex market system. The articles categorize ivory based on weight, condition (e.g., sound, cracked, diseased), and specific characteristics (e.g., fine grain, small hollows, not tapery), with prices varying significantly depending on these factors. This nuanced understanding is further illustrated by the differentiation between various types of ivory, such as teeth, scrivelloes, and billiard ball pieces, demonstrating a sophisticated market system that recognizes and values different qualities of ivory. Together, these sources highlight a disparity in the level of detail provided about the intricacies of ivory market valuation, with the news articles offering a more comprehensive view of the market's complexity.

# The quality and condition of ivory, such as being sound, cracked, or diseased, played a crucial role in determining its market value.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing levels of detail regarding the role of ivory quality and condition in determining its market value. The General History of Africa notes that East African ivory was preferred for its superior quality, being softer and more suitable for luxury goods, which implies that quality influenced its desirability. However, the textbook does not provide specific information on how conditions such as being sound, cracked, or diseased affected market value, highlighting a gap in detailed analysis of these factors. In contrast, The African Times offers comprehensive insights that support the claim, detailing how the condition of ivory—categorized as "sound," "cracked," "diseased," "stale," and "defective"—directly impacted its market value. The articles consistently show that sound and fine ivory commanded higher prices, while cracked, diseased, or stale ivory was sold at lower rates, a pattern observed across various regions like West Coast Africa, Gaboon, Ambriz, and Angola. This consistent valuation approach based on quality and condition, with detailed price ranges for specific conditions, underscores the crucial role these factors played in determining market value, aligning with the claim.

# The scarcity of ivory stocks in public warehouses during this period indicates a potential over-exploitation of elephant populations in Africa.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced perspective on the claim regarding the potential over-exploitation of elephant populations in Africa due to the ivory trade. The General History of Africa highlights the increased demand for East African ivory in the industrialized West, driven by its superior quality for luxury goods, which led to a substantial rise in ivory exports. African merchants, such as the Yao, Bisa, and Chikunda, expanded their commercial empires to meet this demand, indicating a significant increase in ivory extraction. The text also notes the reliance on captives as ivory porters, suggesting an intensified effort to extract ivory, and discusses the economic dislocation and ecological destruction resulting from the slave and ivory trades, implying unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, including elephants. However, it does not explicitly mention the scarcity of ivory stocks in public warehouses, leaving this aspect of the claim partially unsupported. In contrast, The African Times articles directly address the scarcity of ivory stocks in public warehouses, causing anxiety among manufacturers due to rising prices. This scarcity could indicate over-exploitation, as it suggests a decrease in ivory availability, possibly due to reduced elephant populations. The articles also highlight the high demand for ivory, with regular sales in major cities and significant distribution to countries like Germany, France, the United States, and the UK. Despite this, the articles do not explicitly mention the impact on elephant populations or conservation concerns, which diverges from the claim. Together, these sources support the notion of over-exploitation but differ in their focus on specific evidence related to ivory stock levels and elephant population impacts.

# The trade in African commodities such as ivory and palm oil was robust and competitive, indicating their significant economic value in global markets.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the trade in African commodities such as ivory and palm oil was robust and competitive, underscoring their significant economic value in global markets. The textbook details the expansion of trade in these commodities during the nineteenth century, with African merchants actively engaging to meet the demands of new markets in Britain, the USA, and traditional Asian clients. It highlights the increase in ivory exports and the rise of palm oil as a leading export product following the abolition of the slave trade, emphasizing their economic importance. The substantial growth in the value of goods passing through Angolan ports and the increase in palm oil imports into Britain and France further illustrate the robust nature of these trades. However, the textbook also notes challenges faced by African producers, such as a lack of technological innovation and unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world, which limited their ability to fully capitalize on these opportunities. Complementing this, The African Times articles describe animated competition and price advancements for ivory, with large teeth maintaining high prices and medium sizes advancing by about £2, indicating strong demand and a competitive market. The palm oil market is similarly depicted as competitive, with slight price advances for soft river oils and specific price points in regions like Bonny, Old Calabar, and Lagos. Despite limited demand and sparing offerings, palm oil values generally showed an advance, further supporting its economic significance. Together, these sources highlight the significant role of ivory and palm oil in global markets while acknowledging the complexities and limitations faced by African societies in this trade.

# Africa's history is rich and complex, marked by a tapestry of diverse cultures, languages, and civilizations.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present a contrasting picture regarding the claim that Africa's history is rich and complex, marked by a tapestry of diverse cultures, languages, and civilizations. The "General History of Africa" provides substantial support for this claim by detailing four main culture areas—Aja, Yoruba, Borgu, and Edo—each with distinct sub-cultural traits, dialects, and historical backgrounds, illustrating the diversity within the region. It emphasizes linguistic and cultural divisions, such as the Aja-speaking peoples and the Borgu with their distinct languages and dialects, highlighting the complexity and richness of African cultures. The text also discusses historical interactions and migrations among these groups, contributing to a single discernible culture complex, underscoring the interconnectedness and dynamic nature of African civilizations. Furthermore, it addresses the impact of external forces, such as European colonialism and the slave trade, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of African cultures. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide any direct information related to Africa's rich and complex history. Instead, they focus on topics such as the Emancipation Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln, political elections in London, legal discussions, advertisements, and parliamentary bills, primarily centered around historical events and issues in the United States and the United Kingdom. This absence of content related to Africa's historical and cultural richness highlights a lack of representation of African perspectives and narratives in the selected articles.

# The ancient kingdoms of Egypt and Nubia were among the earliest centers of civilization in Africa.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveal a notable absence of discussion regarding the ancient kingdoms of Egypt and Nubia as early centers of civilization in Africa. The textbook primarily addresses various aspects of African history, such as the organization of African diaspora communities, resistance against European colonization, and economic transformations in the 19th century, without specifically focusing on the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Nubia. Similarly, The African Times articles concentrate on 19th-century events and issues, including legal matters involving British and French subjects, economic challenges in the cotton trade, and local community efforts, such as church building, without delving into the historical context of ancient Egypt and Nubia. This lack of information on these ancient African civilizations in both sources highlights their focus on more contemporary socio-economic and political issues rather than historical or archaeological discussions about early African civilizations.

# Africa was home to some of the world's earliest human civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveal a notable absence of discussion regarding Africa's role as the cradle of some of the world's earliest human civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians. The textbook primarily focuses on resistance against European colonization, economic transformations, and the colonial history of Africa from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, mentioning Egypt only in the context of resistance to European partition and economic changes, without delving into its ancient civilization or its significance as an early human civilization. Similarly, The African Times articles concentrate on historical events and developments in Europe, such as the disestablishment of the Irish Church, economic concerns following the 1866 crisis, the Franco-Prussian War, and the death of a French geographical society president, with no mention of African civilizations or historical contexts related to ancient Egypt or other early African societies. This lack of coverage on Africa's ancient historical achievements in both sources highlights a focus on more modern historical events and European contexts, rather than Africa's significant contributions to early human development.

# Africa's ancient civilizations, such as Egypt and Nubia, played a crucial role in the development of early human societies.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles reveal a lack of direct information supporting the claim that Africa's ancient civilizations, such as Egypt and Nubia, played a crucial role in the development of early human societies. The textbook primarily discusses the neolithic revolution's arrival in Africa via Egypt and subsequent agricultural developments, focusing more on cultural areas and the impact of European colonization, without specifically highlighting the contributions of ancient Egyptian or Nubian civilizations to early human societies. This absence of specific references suggests that the textbook may not emphasize their roles in this context, diverging from the claim. Similarly, The African Times articles do not provide any relevant information, as they focus on obituaries, a notice from the Société de Géographie de Marseille, and details of a financial meeting, none of which pertain to ancient African civilizations or their historical impact. This lack of relevant content in both sources underscores a significant gap in addressing the contributions of Egypt and Nubia to early human societal development, which would be of interest to an expert historian studying the claim.

# Africa's history is often misrepresented as static, but it has been dynamic with significant historical developments.

The General History of Africa textbook provides substantial evidence supporting the claim that Africa's history is often misrepresented as static, while in reality, it has been dynamic with significant historical developments. The text explicitly addresses the "myth" of a static Africa, highlighting the tendency to telescope significant changes into the nineteenth century and acknowledging the dynamic nature of African history. It emphasizes the continuity of changes from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century, driven not only by European influence but also by internal dynamics. The textbook discusses significant social, political, and economic transformations, such as Africa's integration into the world economy and the impact of new food sources, illustrating the continent's dynamic history. It critiques the Eurocentric perspective that often overlooks African initiatives and resistance, reinforcing the idea that Africa's history is rich with agency and change. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not directly address the claim regarding Africa's historical misrepresentation or its dynamic nature. The articles focus on unrelated topics, such as 19th-century English criminal court practices and the opulent lifestyle of the Sultan of Turkey, highlighting a notable absence of content related to African history. This discrepancy underscores the relevance of the textbook's observations in challenging the static portrayal of Africa and emphasizing its historical dynamism.

# The trans-Saharan trade routes facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures, contributing to the prosperity of West African kingdoms.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting insights regarding the claim that the trans-Saharan trade routes facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures, contributing to the prosperity of West African kingdoms. The textbook provides detailed support for the claim, highlighting the flourishing trade routes connecting regions such as Timbuktu, Tripoli, and Kano, which were instrumental in exchanging goods like slaves, gold, ivory, ostrich feathers, and textiles. It also notes the movement of luxury items from Europe and North Africa into West Africa, indicating a vibrant exchange of goods. The role of Saharan merchants and nomadic groups in organizing and financing trade suggests a cultural and economic interconnection between different regions, while the involvement of the Sanüsiyya order in maintaining peace and promoting trade along the Benghazi-Wadai route illustrates the exchange of ideas and the establishment of a common legal and social framework. However, the textbook also acknowledges the decline of these trade routes due to the rise of Atlantic shipping and railways. In contrast, The African Times news articles do not provide any information related to the trans-Saharan trade routes or their impact on West African kingdoms. Instead, they focus on political events, legal matters, advertisements, and legislative proposals in 19th-century Britain, with no mention of West African kingdoms, trade routes, or cultural exchanges. This absence of information highlights a significant difference, as the articles do not address the historical context or geographical region relevant to the claim. An expert historian would note this lack of connection between the content of the articles and the claim about the trans-Saharan trade routes and West African prosperity.
