Harford-Battersby, hon. secretary to the Native Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee, writes to the London papers: "A few days ago I returned from the West Coast of Africa, the primary object of my trip being to visit the Niger Mission as a representative of the Church Missionary Society. I was able, however, on my journey to and fro along the coast to make some special investigations with regard to the liquor traffic, and in view of the great urgency of this subject at the present time I venture to offer a few observations on this most important subject. The great difficulty at the present time is the unequal competition of the various political divisions into which West Africa is divided. The low duties, for instance, in force in the German possession of Togoland and that of French Dahomey render the protection of the frontier in each case exceedingly difficult, and at any time this unfortunate state of things may lead to international complications. For this reason I would urge in the strongest terms the necessity for immediate action to be taken to secure international agreement, if only that this undoubted cause of friction may be removed, and that there may be agreement between the Powers who have taken possession of tracts of land in Africa. It can hardly be wondered at that Natives of Africa regard the profession of benevolent intentions which have been put forward with much éclat at the Berlin and Brussels Conferences as, to say the least of it, verging on hypocrisy. . . . It has often been suggested that in appealing for action we are opposing the true interests of British trade. On the contrary, it is clear that in seeking for international agreement as to this matter we are really asking for justice to British trade, as it is well known that Great Britain leads the way in the amount of duty levied on alcohol in the British possessions in West Africa, and Mr. Alfred Jones, of Liverpool, who probably has as much interest in West African trade as any other living man, supported this view strongly at the annual meeting of the Native Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee at Grosvenor House in May last. . . . It is not true, I am thankful to say, that the whole of our West African dominions are utterly demoralised by the drink traffic. Happily the evidence which I have obtained points unmistakably to the fact that only a small part of the territories under our control has been much affected by the spirit trade, as the difficulties of transport render the carriage of spirits far into the interior a difficult matter; but we have evidence that the area is rapidly increasing. With the opening up of roads and the development of railways, and the greater security of travel, drink is finding its way where it had not penetrated before. Now it is in our power to prevent the evils which are too well known in this as in other countries as arising from spirits. In a few years\' time it will be too late if the matter is not dealt with immediately. I cannot close without referring to the splendid stand made by the Royal Niger Company, who, as is well known, have prohibited the import of spirits into the greater part of their territories. From personal experience I know that this is faithfully carried out; and, though some smuggling does occur, in spite of the competition of neighbouring possessions the greater part of Niger is practically free from the evil of the liquor traffic."', 'last_edit_date': '1897-12-01T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.1}

* The liquor traffic in West Africa during the colonial period was a source of international tension due to unequal duties imposed by different colonial powers.
* The Berlin and Brussels Conferences, which professed benevolent intentions towards Africa, were perceived by some as hypocritical, particularly in the context of the liquor trade.
* British colonial policy in West Africa imposed higher duties on alcohol compared to other colonial powers, which was argued to be in the interest of fair trade.
* The spread of alcohol in West Africa was limited by transportation challenges, but the development of infrastructure like roads and railways threatened to increase its reach.
* The Royal Niger Company took a proactive stance against the liquor trade by prohibiting the import of spirits into most of its territories, which was largely effective despite some smuggling.
* There was a belief that immediate action was necessary to prevent the spread of alcohol-related issues in West Africa, as the situation was expected to worsen with increased infrastructure development.
* The liquor trade was not uniformly demoralizing across all British West African territories, but there was concern about its potential to expand and cause harm.

Mr. Walker, American missionary at the Gaboon River, and published by the *American Missionary Herald*:—\n\n"THE CURSE OF INTEMPERANCE.—Alcohol is the burning curse of this country. And the traders, with one exception, are as remorseless as the grave. If they can gain a few pounds of ivory or india-rubber, they care not if the liquor they sell destroys every living being in Africa. There is perfect recklessness in those who come here; no thought for anything except for the greatest gain in the two or three years they are to remain. And how many of them, when counting the few days to their departure, and seeing home and all its joys so near, were cut down in a day! Death laid his hand on them, and visions of home became dark as Erebus. And there was no miracle and no special providence in this. It was only rendering to every man according to his deeds. And if rum has killed a fourth or a third of this people since we came here, it has killed quite as large a proportion of the traders who have sold the poison. Where the foot of the white man has never trod, the fiery stream of alcohol rolls and burns, causing waste and anguish and horrors greater than the middle passage ever witnessed. Some people wonder why the Coast tribes of Africa waste away and disappear. It is no wonder to one who has lived here with his eyes open, unless he himself has come within the maelstrom. The Coast is beleaguered with the hosts of Satan; and they are bold, persistent, untiring, unscrupulous, and unmerciful. If you wish to know some of the concomitants of the rum trade and rum-drinking, read Proverbs xxiii. 33. These are our real obstacles. Heathenism is bad, but unmixed it is not impregnable. Nine-tenths of the liquor exported from Liverpool comes to this Coast.

{'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In another column we have just briefly noticed the pamphlet dealing with the Liquor traffic of Africa which has been lately issued by the C.M.S. as the outcome of a Committee of Delegates of the British Missionary Societies appointed to consider this subject as it concerns the natives of Africa. This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. "The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling." Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: "It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers." We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: "In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand."

4. The gin trade in Africa is considered by some observers to be a greater evil than slavery, due to its pervasive and destructive impact on native societies.
5. The introduction of European trade, including alcohol, has been hypocritically presented as a civilizing mission, while in reality, it has exacerbated social issues and moral decline.
6. The demand for spirits among African communities has increased disproportionately compared to other goods, indicating a targeted exploitation of local vulnerabilities.
7. The liquor trade has been driven by relentless competition and economic pressures, such as the falling price of palm oil, which have further entrenched the trade in spirits.
8. The natural character of native Africans is portrayed as weak and susceptible to exploitation through the liquor trade, reflecting colonial attitudes and justifications for the trade.
9. The scale of the liquor trade in Africa, as evidenced by the vast quantities of spirits imported, highlights the extent of European involvement and responsibility in the issue.
10. The narrative of introducing European trade as a means of elevating African societies is contradicted by the destructive consequences of the liquor trade, revealing a moral and ethical failure on the part of European traders and colonizers.

{'document_title': 'The Liquor Traffic with Native Races', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir G. Taubman-Goldie, Deputy-Governor of the Royal Niger Company, has also drawn up a document on this subject. The title of the paper is "Alcohol and Civilization in Central Africa." In estimating the services done by this Company to civilization, the writer mentions two as undeniable—the substitution of a considerable degree of peace for incessant intertribal wars, and the gradual suppression of slavery. With regard to their dealings in the matter of alcoholic liquors, he points out that they were confronted with these facts: (1) That traffic in European spirits had been carried on within the territories for half a century; (2) that the natives had, long before any importation by white men, manufactured their own intoxicating liquors; and (3) that the European spirits were consumed principally by the chiefs and more powerful classes, who would have driven out of the country any house which refused to meet their requirements. If the Company had refused to supply alcohol, commerce and political influence would probably have fallen into the hands of petty traders, who would have flooded Africa with European spirits, and yet not have carried on the great work of civilization. The Company adopted a middle course, and endeavoured to restrict the sale of liquors as much as possible. In 1886, the import of liquors had decreased by more than one-half in two years. Heavy duties were imposed on imported spirits. Smuggling was checked, the payment of wages in spirits was forbidden, and importation was altogether forbidden in the Benue districts. In a letter to Lord Salisbury, dated May 3, 1887, the writer summed up the case as follows: "The Company would be equally willing to prohibit the importation of spirituous liquors into another third of its territories—namely, that lying on either side of the main Niger, above its confluence with the Benue, but for the fact that, owing to the very low duty on spirits levied in the British colony of Lagos, such a measure on the part of the Company would be rendered nugatory by the smuggling of spirits from Lagos into the province of Nupe through Illorin. The Council of the Company are aware of the difficulties attending the raising of the spirit duties at Lagos to the heavy rate levied on the Gold Coast and in the Niger territories—difficulties which arise from the adjacent French and German settlements levying no duties whatever upon spirits, which are chiefly exported from France and Germany. It may at first sight appear hopeless under these circumstances to approach their respective Governments with the view of inducing them to impose a tax on the import into Africa of spirituous liquors, but the Council think they might be convinced by the same arguments which have induced the Company—not merely from philanthropic, but from sound business motives—to discourage the importation of spirituous liquors; firstly, by means of heavy duties throughout the territories, and now by actual prohibition as regards one-third of those territories. I would venture to point out to your lordship that the evils of the spirit traffic have been exaggerated, and that all colonizing nations have an interest in extending and developing their general trade with West Africa, and that no business mainly based on the liquor traffic can be sound or permanent, or can lead to fresh requirements on the part of the natives, who are gradually becoming, through the trade in useful articles, more civilized, and leading more complex existences. While it is certain that the manufacturers of spirits in Germany and France would strain every nerve to induce their Governments to maintain the present system, the Council hope that public opinion in those countries would recognize the folly of sacrificing to the interests of a small clique the prospects of a large colonial development and of permanent and growing trade in useful articles. The Council feel that they may be liable to the accusation of stepping beyond their province in laying this matter before your Lordship, but hope that the great importance of the subject may be considered sufficient excuse. An arrangement with France and Germany such as is suggested above would admit of a uniform duty on spirits being levied from Senegal to the Cameroons, inclusive. Such uniform duty might be fixed at the highest rate, which would not make the inducements for smuggling so great as to defy preventive precautions. I submit, that with a uniform system extending over 2,500 miles of coast, a duty four times as high as that now levied in the Gold Coast Colony, and 20 times as high as that now levied at Lagos, might safely be imposed."', 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.099}

Found low level hypotheses:
The Royal Niger Company's involvement in the alcohol trade was a strategic decision to maintain political influence and control over commerce in Central Africa, suggesting that alcohol was a significant factor in colonial power dynamics.
The claim that African communities were producing their own intoxicating liquors before European contact challenges the narrative that alcohol was solely a colonial introduction, indicating a pre-existing cultural role for alcohol in African societies.
The consumption of European spirits primarily by chiefs and powerful classes implies that alcohol played a role in reinforcing social hierarchies and power structures within African societies during the colonial period.
The imposition of heavy duties and restrictions on the importation of spirits by the Royal Niger Company suggests that controlling the alcohol trade was seen as essential for sustainable economic development and the promotion of other forms of trade.
The competition between British, French, and German colonial interests in Africa, as reflected in their differing policies on spirit duties, highlights the role of alcohol in international colonial rivalries and economic strategies.
The Royal Niger Company's efforts to restrict alcohol imports were driven by both philanthropic and business motives, suggesting a complex interplay between moral considerations and economic interests in colonial policy-making.
The narrative that reducing alcohol consumption was part of the "civilizing" mission of colonial powers reflects the paternalistic attitudes of the time and raises questions about the true intentions and impacts of such policies on African societies.
The issue of smuggling due to varying duties on spirits across different colonies illustrates the challenges colonial administrations faced in enforcing trade policies and maintaining control over their territories.

In Sierra Leone the people drink rum and gin, and their condition is dreadful. In the other district they are clean, tidy, neat, and are superior physically, morally, and intellectually. Mr. Buckstone attributes this superiority to the fact that the people are practically prohibited from drinking by the very high license which exists.

Fox Bourne, Secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society, read a paper at the recent Conference of the Association for the Reform and Codification of the Law of Nations at Brussels, on "The Regulation of the Liquor Traffic in Africa." He said into British West Africa, including the four colonies of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, together with the Niger Coast Protectorate and the territory of the Royal Niger Company, a total of more than five million gallons of rum and gin was imported in 1893, and the supply appeared to be increasing at the rate of about half-a-million gallons a year. Of the quantities imported into the French, German, Portuguese, and other possessions from Senegambia in the north to Angola in the south, and including the great Congo district which, as regarded the regions near the sea coast, was supposed to be more drink-poisoned than any other—authentic particulars were not forthcoming, but it was safe to assume that the aggregate was at least thrice as great as the quantity for which Great Britain was directly responsible. An earnest appeal was now being made to her Majesty\'s Government by the Aborigines Protection Society, not only for the exercise of its good offices in endeavouring to obtain such co-operation of all the Powers concerned as was essential to an adequate reform, but also, without waiting till a complete and comprehensive International policy could be secured for the immediate enforcement of such remedial measures as Great Britain could independently enter upon. Even now the duties on imported spirits levied in British possessions were, on the whole, higher than those imposed elsewhere in West Africa, and gain—not loss—appeared to result therefrom. But the present duties, even the highest of them, were far too low, and what was asked for by the Society was that the duties should be at once raised to some extent, and that there should be a steady progressive increase from year to year, or at intervals of not more than two years, to enable traders to adapt themselves to the altered conditions, until a satisfactory standard was reached.

1. The importation of alcohol, specifically rum and gin, into British West Africa in the late 19th century was substantial and increasing, indicating a significant role of alcohol in the region's colonial economy.
2. The widespread availability and consumption of imported spirits in Africa during this period may have contributed to social and health issues, as suggested by the term "drink-poisoned" used to describe certain regions.
3. The Aborigines Protection Society's appeal to the British government for higher duties on imported spirits suggests that there was a recognized need for regulatory intervention to mitigate the negative impacts of alcohol in African colonies.
4. The economic interests of colonial powers, including Great Britain, may have conflicted with social welfare concerns, as evidenced by the debate over raising duties on imported spirits to reduce alcohol consumption.
5. The call for international cooperation among colonial powers to regulate the liquor trade in Africa implies that the issue of alcohol was not confined to British territories but was a broader concern across various European colonies.

In this declaration of the Government we see that this subject has not been lacking consideration from those in authority.

A very short time ago the Anti-Slavery Conference at Brussels came to an agreement respecting the prohibition of the liquor traffic in Central Africa, and immediately, acting upon that agreement, the Royal Niger Company prohibited the importation of spirituous liquors for sale or barter, into any place within the jurisdiction of the Company, north of the seventh parallel of latitude—that is to say, into about nineteen-twentieths of the vast regions over which the Company hold sway. In announcing this policy, the Company stated that they trusted that the day was not far distant when the same policy might be adopted over the remainder of the Company\'s territory, but they felt that until their military force was greatly strengthened, any such attempt would be attended by disastrous failure.\n\nAs a great deal of doubt has been openly expressed as to the effect of this prohibition upon trade in various parts of Africa, a representative of the _Oracle_ recently sought out the Rev.

The sketch of coastline is about the same length and the population, perhaps, thicker in the north than the south.\n\nNobody deplores drunkenness more than myself; but, as it is impossible to stop the "rum" traffic, the only way is to educate the natives not to emulate the drunkenness in the British Isles, and their Mohammedan religion (such as it is) has done a good deal in that direction.—Yours truly,', 'last_edit_date': '1889-11-04T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_11_1889#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.099}

Found low level hypotheses:
* The importation and consumption of alcohol in West Africa were influenced by European trade practices and pricing strategies.
* The perception of alcohol-related issues in West Africa was often compared to those in European cities, such as Liverpool, suggesting differing levels of societal impact.
* Prohibitive duties on alcohol did not necessarily correlate with reduced importation or consumption, as evidenced by the comparison between British and French territories.
* The role of religion, particularly Islam, played a significant part in moderating alcohol consumption among certain African communities.
* European colonial powers had differing policies on alcohol importation, which affected local consumption patterns and societal norms.
* The economic impact of alcohol trade in West Africa was significant enough to be a topic of discussion in European political arenas, such as the House of Lords.
* There was a belief that education could be a more effective tool than legislation in reducing alcohol consumption and its negative effects in African societies.

{'document_title': 'THE DRINK TRAFFIC ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In view of the statements which are constantly being made as to the extent of the importation and consumption of spirits in the countries on the West Coast of Africa, it is interesting to extract the figures relating to the importation of alcoholic liquors from the report on the Gold Coast colony which has just been presented to Parliament. In 1892 the importation of rum amounted to 1,029,114 gallons, of the value of £75,629; gin and geneva, 220,322 gallons, of the value of £18,185; whiskey, 5,054 gallons, valued at £2,244; brandy, 485 gallons, valued at £401; wines, 20,492 gallons, valued at £6,085; ale and porter, 19,665 gallons, valued at £2,256. Commenting on these figures, the Colonial Secretary, Mr. F. M. Hodson, points out that with an estimated population of 1,473,882 this gives an average consumption of nearly a gallon a head; but there is no doubt that a large quantity of the spirits imported into the colony finds its way into Ashanti and other interior countries not within the protectorate, and that three-quarters of a gallon per head more nearly approximates to accuracy. In the United Kingdom, with its population of 38,000,000, the annual consumption of spirits is roughly 39,000,000 gallons, and of beer 31,000,000 barrels, besides other strong drinks. It is clear, therefore, he says, that the consumption of alcoholic drinks on the Gold Coast compares very favourably with that of the United Kingdom. "Drunkenness on the Gold Coast is comparatively uncommon. East of the river Volta, where, on account of the low duties, rum can be purchased for 3d. a bottle, and where, therefore, if the importation of spirits into the midst of the natives has the demoralising influence so often contended for it, the effects would be at once visible, there is absolutely no increase of drunkenness apparent." "It would seem, therefore," the Colonial Secretary concludes, "that the West African native is not without a proper appreciation of the advantages of temperate habits."—*Times.*', 'last_edit_date': '1894-01-01T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1894#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.1}

Found low level hypotheses:
* The importation and consumption of alcohol in the Gold Coast during the late 19th century was significant, yet did not lead to widespread drunkenness, suggesting a cultural or social moderation in alcohol use among West Africans.
* The comparison of alcohol consumption between the Gold Coast and the United Kingdom indicates that the narrative of alcohol having a demoralizing influence on West African societies may be overstated or misrepresented.
* The distribution of imported spirits beyond the Gold Coast into regions like Ashanti suggests a broader network of trade and cultural exchange involving alcohol in West Africa.
* The low incidence of drunkenness despite the availability of cheap rum challenges the stereotype of African societies being easily corrupted by alcohol introduced by Europeans.
* The economic impact of alcohol importation on the Gold Coast's economy in the late 19th century could have been significant, potentially influencing local trade dynamics and colonial economic policies.
* The perception of temperance among West African natives by colonial officials might reflect a misunderstanding or oversimplification of local customs and social norms regarding alcohol consumption.
