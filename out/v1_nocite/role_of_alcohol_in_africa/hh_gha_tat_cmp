HH: The Royal Niger Company's efforts to restrict alcohol imports were driven by both philanthropic and business motives, suggesting a complex interplay between moral considerations and economic interests in colonial policy-making.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about the Royal Niger Company's efforts to restrict alcohol imports, nor does it explicitly discuss the company's motivations, whether philanthropic or business-oriented. However, the textbook does mention the significant role of alcohol in colonial trade, highlighting its economic impact, such as the substantial government revenue derived from spirits in the Niger Coast Protectorate. This suggests that economic interests were a major factor in colonial policy-making. The text also notes the negative health effects of alcohol, which could imply a potential moral consideration, but it does not directly link this to the Royal Niger Company's actions. Therefore, while the textbook provides context on the economic and health implications of alcohol trade in colonial Africa, it does not specifically address the Royal Niger Company's motivations or actions, indicating a gap in the information related to the claim.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the Royal Niger Company's efforts to restrict alcohol imports were driven by both philanthropic and business motives. Sir G. Taubman-Goldie, Deputy-Governor of the Royal Niger Company, explicitly mentions that the company adopted a middle course to restrict the sale of liquors, motivated not only by philanthropic reasons but also by sound business motives. The articles highlight the company's actions, such as imposing heavy duties on imported spirits, prohibiting importation in certain districts, and reducing the importation of spirits by 75% over four years. These efforts are framed as part of a broader strategy to promote civilization and suppress slavery, indicating a moral dimension. However, the articles also emphasize the economic rationale, noting that a business model based on the liquor trade is unsustainable and that the company aims to develop a more permanent and growing trade in useful articles. The articles suggest that the company's policy was influenced by the need to maintain political influence and prevent commerce from falling into the hands of petty traders. Thus, the articles align with the claim by illustrating the complex interplay between moral considerations and economic interests in the company's policy-making.


HH: The liquor trade in Africa was a form of economic exploitation that paralleled other forms of colonial exploitation, such as the extraction of ivory and rubber.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that the liquor trade in Africa was a form of economic exploitation similar to other colonial exploitations like the extraction of ivory and rubber. The text highlights that the liquor trade, particularly in strong alcoholic drinks, had a deleterious effect on health and was driven by immense profits for European producers, similar to the economic motivations behind the extraction of ivory and rubber. The trade in spirits was so extensive that it constituted a significant portion of government revenue in regions like the Niger Coast Protectorate, indicating its economic importance and exploitative nature. Additionally, the text mentions that the liquor trade was often conducted in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, paralleling the exploitative trade practices in ivory and rubber, where Africans received goods that did not equate to the value of their exports. However, the text does not explicitly compare the liquor trade to the extraction of ivory and rubber in terms of environmental or social impact, which could be seen as a difference in the depth of analysis between the claim and the textbook content. Overall, the textbook supports the claim by illustrating the economic exploitation inherent in the liquor trade, akin to other colonial exploitations.
	 - From TAT: The paragraphs from the African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the liquor trade in Africa was a form of economic exploitation akin to the extraction of ivory and rubber. The Rev. Mr. Walker's account highlights the remorseless nature of traders who prioritize profit over the well-being of African communities, paralleling the exploitative practices seen in the extraction of ivory and rubber. The traders' indifference to the destructive impact of alcohol on African societies mirrors the broader colonial disregard for indigenous welfare in pursuit of economic gain. Furthermore, the comparison between the Senegambia district and Sierra Leone underscores the detrimental effects of the liquor trade, suggesting that areas with restricted alcohol access fare better physically, morally, and intellectually. This aligns with the notion that the liquor trade, like other colonial enterprises, contributed to the degradation and exploitation of African societies. The mention of the Y.M.C.A. of Abeokuta's document, which equates the harm of the rum and gin trade to that of the slave trade, further emphasizes the severe impact of this economic exploitation. Overall, the articles provide a compelling narrative that supports the claim of the liquor trade as a parallel form of colonial exploitation.


HH: The negative impact of the alcohol trade in Africa was considered by some contemporaries to be more harmful than the effects of the slave trade.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides some insights into the impact of the alcohol trade in Africa, but it does not directly compare it to the effects of the slave trade in terms of harm. The text mentions that the flow of strong alcoholic drinks into Africa had a deleterious effect on health, with alcohol being produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits. It also notes that spirits were distributed on a large scale, often as wages, and that a significant portion of government revenue in certain regions was derived from the alcohol trade. However, the text does not explicitly state that the alcohol trade was considered more harmful than the slave trade. Instead, it provides a detailed account of the extensive and disruptive impact of the slave trade on African societies, including social and political destabilization, economic dependency, and demographic losses. The text highlights the catastrophic nature of the slave trade for Africa, as agreed upon by historians, sociologists, and cliometricians. Therefore, while the alcohol trade is acknowledged as harmful, the text does not support the claim that it was considered more harmful than the slave trade by contemporaries. This absence of direct comparison in the text is a notable difference from the claim.
	 - From TAT: The paragraphs from the African Times news articles provide substantial support for the claim that the negative impact of the alcohol trade in Africa was considered by some contemporaries to be more harmful than the effects of the slave trade. Rev. Mr. Walker, an American missionary, describes alcohol as a "burning curse" and highlights the devastating effects of the liquor trade on both the African population and the traders themselves. He emphasizes the widespread destruction and anguish caused by alcohol, comparing its horrors to those of the middle passage, a reference to the transatlantic slave trade. Furthermore, the document from the Y.M.C.A. of Abeokuta explicitly states that the rum and gin trade did "considerably more harm" than the slave trade, reinforcing the claim. These observations indicate that some contemporaries viewed the alcohol trade as a significant and possibly greater threat to African societies than the slave trade, aligning with the claim in question.


HH: The introduction and control of alcohol in African colonies were seen as tools of colonial power, with the potential to either destabilize or pacify local populations.

	 - From GHA: The "General History of Africa" textbook provides several details that align with the claim that the introduction and control of alcohol in African colonies were used as tools of colonial power. The text mentions that the trade of strong alcoholic drinks had a deleterious effect on health and was a significant source of revenue for colonial administrations, as seen in the Niger Coast Protectorate, where spirits accounted for a substantial portion of government revenue and customs duties. This suggests that alcohol was not only a commercial commodity but also a means of economic control. Additionally, the text notes that some African leaders, like Kgama and Lewanika, attempted to banish the public use of alcoholic beverages, indicating that alcohol was perceived as a destabilizing force that needed to be controlled to maintain social order. However, the text does not explicitly discuss alcohol as a tool for pacifying local populations, which is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, the textbook supports the idea that alcohol was used as a tool of colonial power, primarily through economic exploitation and social control, but it does not directly address its role in pacification.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide details that align with the claim that the introduction and control of alcohol in African colonies were seen as tools of colonial power, with the potential to either destabilize or pacify local populations. The articles highlight the efforts of the British Government and the Royal Niger Company to prevent the extension of the drink traffic among "half-civilized or savage races," indicating a perception of alcohol as a destabilizing force. The Government's actions to assist chiefs in preventing the ruin of their people by alcohol and the Royal Niger Company's prohibition of spirituous liquors in certain regions suggest a strategic use of alcohol control to maintain order and support colonial interests. The reduction of spirit importation by 75 percent in four years further underscores the deliberate regulation of alcohol as a means to influence local populations. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the use of alcohol to pacify populations, focusing instead on preventing demoralization and ensuring the success of colonial operations. This absence of explicit mention of pacification is a notable difference from the claim.


HH: The narrative that alcohol abuse in Africa was a consequence of contact with European civilization implies a critique of the civilizing mission and its detrimental effects on indigenous cultures.

	 - From GHA: The provided paragraphs from the "General History of Africa" textbook do not explicitly address the issue of alcohol abuse as a consequence of contact with European civilization. However, they do critique the civilizing mission and its detrimental effects on indigenous cultures, highlighting the imposition of European cultural norms and the denigration of African traditions. The text discusses the missionaries' condemnation of traditional practices and the cultural imposition that accompanied colonial rule, which led to a sense of inferiority among Africans and a disruption of their cultural institutions. While the narrative of alcohol abuse is not directly mentioned, the broader critique of the civilizing mission aligns with the claim's implication that European contact had negative impacts on African societies. The absence of specific mention of alcohol abuse in the textbook is a notable difference, suggesting that while the critique of European influence is present, the particular issue of alcohol abuse may not have been a focal point in this context.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that alcohol abuse in Africa was exacerbated by contact with European civilization, thereby critiquing the civilizing mission and its detrimental effects on indigenous cultures. The articles highlight that the liquor traffic in Africa, particularly the trade in spirits like gin and rum, was significantly driven by European influence. It is noted that the wages of native laborers, including children, were sometimes paid in spirits, leading to widespread drunkenness and unproductivity. The articles also mention that the idea of drinking spirits is closely associated with European life in the minds of the natives, suggesting that this behavior was introduced or intensified by European presence. Furthermore, the articles criticize the hypocrisy of European traders who, while claiming to civilize and elevate African societies, simultaneously supplied them with large quantities of alcohol, thus driving them into deeper depravity. This aligns with the claim by illustrating the negative impact of European trade practices on African societies. However, the articles also acknowledge that the knowledge of making intoxicating substances existed in Africa prior to European contact, indicating that while European influence exacerbated the problem, it did not introduce it entirely. This nuance adds complexity to the narrative, suggesting that the issue of alcohol abuse was not solely a consequence of European civilization but was significantly worsened by it.


HH: The widespread availability and consumption of imported spirits in Africa during this period may have contributed to social and health issues, as suggested by the term "drink-poisoned" used to describe certain regions.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the social and health issues associated with the widespread availability and consumption of imported spirits in Africa during this period. The text mentions that the flow of strong alcoholic drinks into the continent had a deleterious effect on health, with spirits being distributed on a large scale, often as wages. This aligns with the claim of "drink-poisoned" regions, suggesting that the consumption of spirits was significant enough to impact health and social conditions. Additionally, the text notes that by 1894, a substantial portion of government revenue in the Niger Coast Protectorate was derived from spirits, indicating the economic importance and widespread distribution of alcohol. However, the text also presents a contrasting view from Mary Kingsley, who found the trade spirit pure and less harmful than cannabis, suggesting some debate over the extent of the negative impact. Overall, the textbook supports the claim by highlighting the significant role of imported spirits in the economy and its potential health implications, while also acknowledging differing perspectives on its effects.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the widespread availability and consumption of imported spirits in Africa during this period contributed to social and health issues. The Rev. Mr. Walker's account describes alcohol as a "burning curse" and highlights the destructive impact of liquor on both the local population and the traders themselves, suggesting a significant social and health crisis. He notes that alcohol has killed a large proportion of both Africans and traders, and he describes the situation as causing "waste and anguish and horrors." Furthermore, the term "drink-poisoned" is used to describe regions near the sea coast in the Congo district, aligning with the claim's suggestion of negative consequences. Mr. H. R. Fox Bourne's report also supports the claim by indicating the massive importation of rum and gin into British West Africa and other regions, with an increasing supply, which implies a growing problem. The appeal for higher duties on imported spirits and international cooperation to address the issue further underscores the recognition of alcohol's detrimental effects. These details collectively affirm the claim that the availability and consumption of imported spirits were linked to significant social and health issues in Africa during this period.


HH: The introduction of European alcoholic beverages, such as rum and gin, exacerbated existing issues of alcohol abuse in Africa, leading to widespread social and health problems.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides details that support the claim that the introduction of European alcoholic beverages exacerbated issues of alcohol abuse in Africa, leading to social and health problems. The text mentions that the flow of strong alcoholic drinks into the continent had a deleterious effect on health. It highlights that alcohol was produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits in Africa, often being distributed on a large scale and even used as wages. This trade in spirits was significant enough to contribute substantially to government revenue, as seen in the Niger Coast Protectorate, where half of the total government revenue and 95% of customs duties were derived from spirits by 1894. The Brussels Act of 1892 attempted to limit the trade in the Congo, but regulation was not successful in tropical Africa until the eve of the First World War. These details align with the claim by illustrating how the introduction of European alcoholic beverages contributed to social and health issues in Africa. However, the text does not explicitly discuss the exacerbation of existing alcohol abuse issues, which is a subtle difference from the claim. Overall, the textbook provides a historical context that supports the claim's assertion of negative impacts from European alcohol trade in Africa.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide details that support the claim that the introduction of European alcoholic beverages, such as rum and gin, exacerbated existing issues of alcohol abuse in Africa. The articles highlight that prior to European contact, various African communities already had access to indigenous alcoholic beverages, such as palm sap, cashew apple juice, and plantain wine, which were widely consumed. However, the articles suggest that the arrival of Europeans and the subsequent introduction of rum and gin intensified the problem of alcohol abuse, as these stronger spirits were supplied to the local populations. The statement by Rev. J. Grant Mills underscores this point by noting that the European-supplied rum and gin "has destroyed its millions," indicating a significant negative impact on social and health conditions. This aligns with the claim that European alcoholic beverages worsened existing alcohol-related issues. The articles do not provide specific details on the social and health problems caused, but the emphasis on the destructive nature of these spirits suggests a widespread detrimental effect.
