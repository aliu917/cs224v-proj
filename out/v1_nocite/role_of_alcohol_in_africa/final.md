The examination of the Royal Niger Company's efforts to restrict alcohol imports reveals a nuanced interplay between economic interests and moral considerations in colonial policy-making, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. While the General History of Africa does not specifically address the Royal Niger Company's motivations or actions, it highlights the significant economic role of alcohol in colonial trade, such as the substantial government revenue from spirits in the Niger Coast Protectorate, suggesting that economic interests were a major factor in colonial policy-making. It also notes the negative health effects of alcohol, hinting at potential moral considerations, though not directly linked to the company's actions. In contrast, The African Times provides explicit details supporting the claim that the Royal Niger Company's restrictions on alcohol imports were driven by both philanthropic and business motives. Sir G. Taubman-Goldie, Deputy-Governor of the company, is cited as stating that the company adopted a middle course to restrict liquor sales, motivated by both philanthropic reasons and sound business motives. The articles describe actions such as imposing heavy duties on imported spirits, prohibiting importation in certain districts, and reducing spirit imports by 75% over four years, framed as part of a broader strategy to promote civilization and suppress slavery, indicating a moral dimension. Simultaneously, the economic rationale is emphasized, noting the unsustainability of a liquor-based business model and the company's aim to develop a more permanent trade in useful articles, while maintaining political influence and preventing commerce from falling into the hands of petty traders. Together, these sources illustrate the complex interplay between moral and economic factors in the Royal Niger Company's policy-making.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the liquor trade in Africa was a form of economic exploitation akin to the extraction of ivory and rubber. The General History of Africa highlights that the liquor trade, particularly in strong alcoholic drinks, had a deleterious effect on health and was driven by immense profits for European producers, mirroring the economic motivations behind the extraction of ivory and rubber. The trade in spirits was so extensive that it constituted a significant portion of government revenue in regions like the Niger Coast Protectorate, underscoring its economic importance and exploitative nature. Additionally, the trade was often conducted in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, paralleling exploitative trade practices in ivory and rubber, where Africans received goods that did not equate to the value of their exports. However, the textbook does not explicitly compare the liquor trade to the extraction of ivory and rubber in terms of environmental or social impact. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a more direct comparison, with accounts like that of Rev. Mr. Walker highlighting the remorseless nature of traders who prioritized profit over the well-being of African communities, similar to the exploitative practices in ivory and rubber extraction. The articles emphasize the destructive impact of alcohol on African societies, noting that areas with restricted alcohol access, such as the Senegambia district compared to Sierra Leone, fare better physically, morally, and intellectually. The Y.M.C.A. of Abeokuta's document equates the harm of the rum and gin trade to that of the slave trade, further underscoring the severe impact of this economic exploitation. Together, these sources provide a compelling narrative that supports the claim of the liquor trade as a parallel form of colonial exploitation.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide contrasting perspectives on the claim that the negative impact of the alcohol trade in Africa was considered by some contemporaries to be more harmful than the effects of the slave trade. The General History of Africa acknowledges the deleterious effects of the alcohol trade, noting that strong alcoholic drinks, cheaply produced in Europe, were sold for immense profits in Africa, adversely affecting health and contributing significantly to government revenue in certain regions. However, the text does not directly compare the alcohol trade to the slave trade in terms of harm. Instead, it emphasizes the catastrophic impact of the slave trade on African societies, highlighting social and political destabilization, economic dependency, and demographic losses, as agreed upon by historians, sociologists, and cliometricians. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim, with Rev. Mr. Walker, an American missionary, describing alcohol as a "burning curse" and comparing its devastating effects to the horrors of the middle passage. Additionally, a document from the Y.M.C.A. of Abeokuta explicitly states that the rum and gin trade did "considerably more harm" than the slave trade. These observations from The African Times indicate that some contemporaries viewed the alcohol trade as a significant and possibly greater threat to African societies than the slave trade, aligning with the claim in question.

The introduction and control of alcohol in African colonies were indeed seen as tools of colonial power, as evidenced by observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights that the trade of strong alcoholic drinks had a deleterious effect on health and served as a significant source of revenue for colonial administrations, such as in the Niger Coast Protectorate, where spirits accounted for a substantial portion of government revenue and customs duties. This underscores alcohol's role as a means of economic control and social destabilization, as evidenced by African leaders like Kgama and Lewanika attempting to banish its public use to maintain social order. However, the textbook does not explicitly address alcohol as a tool for pacifying local populations. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the British Government and the Royal Niger Company's efforts to prevent the extension of the drink traffic among "half-civilized or savage races," viewing alcohol as a destabilizing force. The Government's assistance to chiefs in preventing the ruin of their people by alcohol and the Royal Niger Company's prohibition of spirituous liquors in certain regions reflect a strategic use of alcohol control to maintain order and support colonial interests. The reduction of spirit importation by 75 percent in four years further highlights the deliberate regulation of alcohol to influence local populations. However, like the textbook, the articles do not explicitly discuss the use of alcohol to pacify populations, focusing instead on preventing demoralization and ensuring the success of colonial operations. Both sources support the idea that alcohol was used as a tool of colonial power, primarily through economic exploitation and social control, but neither directly addresses its role in pacification.

The narrative that alcohol abuse in Africa was a consequence of contact with European civilization implies a critique of the civilizing mission and its detrimental effects on indigenous cultures. The "General History of Africa" textbook critiques the civilizing mission by highlighting the imposition of European cultural norms and the denigration of African traditions, which led to a sense of inferiority among Africans and disrupted their cultural institutions. Although the textbook does not explicitly address alcohol abuse, it aligns with the broader critique of European influence as having negative impacts on African societies. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide specific details supporting the claim that alcohol abuse was exacerbated by European contact. They highlight the role of European traders in the liquor traffic, noting that spirits like gin and rum were often used as payment for native laborers, leading to widespread drunkenness and unproductivity. The articles criticize the hypocrisy of Europeans who, while claiming to civilize African societies, supplied them with large quantities of alcohol, thus deepening societal issues. However, the articles also acknowledge that the knowledge of making intoxicating substances existed in Africa prior to European contact, suggesting that while European influence worsened the problem, it did not introduce it entirely. This nuanced perspective indicates that the issue of alcohol abuse was significantly exacerbated by European presence, adding complexity to the narrative of the civilizing mission's detrimental effects.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the widespread availability and consumption of imported spirits in Africa during this period contributed to significant social and health issues, as suggested by the term "drink-poisoned" used to describe certain regions. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the deleterious health effects of the large-scale distribution of strong alcoholic drinks, often used as wages, which aligns with the notion of "drink-poisoned" regions. It also notes the economic importance of spirits, with a substantial portion of government revenue in the Niger Coast Protectorate by 1894 derived from alcohol sales. However, the text presents a contrasting view from Mary Kingsley, who considered the trade spirit less harmful than cannabis, indicating some debate over the extent of the negative impact. Meanwhile, The African Times articles reinforce the claim by describing alcohol as a "burning curse," with Rev. Mr. Walker highlighting its destructive impact on both the local population and traders, leading to "waste and anguish and horrors." The term "drink-poisoned" is specifically used to describe regions near the sea coast in the Congo district. Mr. H. R. Fox Bourne's report further supports the claim by noting the massive importation of rum and gin into British West Africa and other regions, with an increasing supply, suggesting a growing problem. The call for higher duties on imported spirits and international cooperation underscores the recognition of alcohol's detrimental effects. Together, these sources affirm the significant role of imported spirits in contributing to social and health issues in Africa during this period, while acknowledging differing perspectives on its impact.

The introduction of European alcoholic beverages, such as rum and gin, exacerbated existing issues of alcohol abuse in Africa, leading to widespread social and health problems, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a historical context, detailing how the influx of strong alcoholic drinks into Africa had a deleterious effect on health. It notes that alcohol was cheaply produced in Europe and sold for immense profits in Africa, often being distributed on a large scale and even used as wages. This trade was significant enough to contribute substantially to government revenue, as evidenced by the Niger Coast Protectorate, where by 1894, half of the total government revenue and 95% of customs duties were derived from spirits. Although the Brussels Act of 1892 attempted to limit this trade in the Congo, effective regulation in tropical Africa was not achieved until the eve of the First World War. While the textbook does not explicitly discuss the exacerbation of existing alcohol abuse issues, it supports the claim by illustrating the negative impacts of the European alcohol trade. Complementing this, The African Times articles highlight that prior to European contact, various African communities already consumed indigenous alcoholic beverages, such as palm sap, cashew apple juice, and plantain wine. However, the arrival of Europeans and the introduction of stronger spirits like rum and gin intensified alcohol abuse problems. Rev. J. Grant Mills emphasized this by stating that European-supplied rum and gin "has destroyed its millions," indicating a significant negative impact on social and health conditions. Although the articles do not provide specific details on the resulting social and health problems, they underscore the destructive nature of these spirits, suggesting a widespread detrimental effect. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of how European alcoholic beverages worsened existing alcohol-related issues in Africa.
