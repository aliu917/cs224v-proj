Lugard laid much stress on this, claiming that Nigeria's more deserted areas were evidence of periodic devastation.$^{48}$ Certainly there was some insecurity in pre-colonial Africa, as is evidenced by the defensive location of many villages from which 'downhill movements' of farmers to better agricultural locations occurred after their safety could be guaranteed. 49 The claim of greater security was true in the long run but highly questionable during the first decades.

What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle.

Indeed, Africans had been present in Western Europe from Classical Antiquity onwards, though the numbers only became substantial from about the fifteenth century on, when black Africans, first as slaves and then as freedmen, began to appear in southern Spain and Portugal, arriving at first by way of the trans-Saharan trade to North Africa. Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did. From 1685, residence in France was held to confer freedom, and the same was true of England after the notable judicial decision of Lord Mansfield in 1772 already noted.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.551, 'probability_score': 0.05}

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the "Dark Continent" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.552, 'probability_score': 0.05}

Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the "Dark Continent" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'.

While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam. The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians. The British in Northern Nigeria, which was predominantly Muslim, were very sensitive to the possible impact of Islamic propaganda there, but the community of interest established between the Sultan and emirs of the Sokoto Caliphate and the British ensured the loyalty of the bulk of Northern Nigerian Muslims.", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.539, 'probability_score': 0.05}

It has been suggested by two researchers on Ndebele and Shona history that the same is true of my own account of the 1896 risings in Southern Rhodesia; the British South Africa Company said the risings were fomented by 'witch› doctors'; I argued that they were powered by a profound prophetic ideology; Julian Cobbing and David Beach assert that the spirit mediums were of much more restricted influence than I allowed and that the priests of Mwari participated in the risings hardly at all.$^{29}$ It will perhaps not be found surprising that I am unready for such drastic revisions. But it certainly is true that recent work on African religion in Southern Rhodesia shows that its relationship to resistance cannot have been so straightforward as I had supposed. It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements.

The prophet of resistance was Makana; the prophet of 'controlled accommodation' was Ntsikana. Ntsikana was a creative religious genius of the same order as Makana; the debates between them on the nature of divinity had very immediate practical consequences and divided the Xhosa into factions, but they were conducted in profound theological terms. And in fact Ntsikana was not primarily concerned with the problems of relationships to the whites, his intention was rather to bring about changes in Xhosa society by means of accepting some of the dynamics of Christian thought, while at the same time repudiating many of the cultural assumptions of the whites.

Raum tells us, among many Xhosa today 'the beginning of Christianity is not credited to the missionaries but rather to a Christian forerunner in the person of Ntsikana'. 31 Though no other case presents us with so dramatic and direct a prophetic clash as the debate between Makana and Ntsikana, the same range of prophetic possibilities comes out clearly even in areas of very determined resistance, like the areas in which Majï Majï took place, or the Shona areas of Rhodesia.

What they have found bears little resemblance either to the \'fanatical witch-doctors\' of colonial reports, or to \'the magic of despair\'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that \'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for "primary resistances" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.\' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. \'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine\'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the \'high priestess\' was dismissed and executed. \'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.\' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged.

Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west.

In some ways Makana's teaching was an African version of the Protestant Christian ideology of sovereignty, which later gave Wittboi confidence in the divine right of the Red Captains. Makana explored the fundamental differences between black and white - different customs, different divinities, different destinies. The creator was Dali'dephu, great ancestor of the Xhosa, who had made Uthixo to be the god of the white men. Uthixo was an inferior to Dali'dephu, and the white men were morally the inferior of the Xhosa - continually vexed with the idea of sin. But this difference did not matter until the two moral universes came into contact and into conflict; then Dali'dephu would assert himself to ensure that his own particular children, the Xhosa, and their own particular and superior way of life triumphed over the super› ficial powers of the whites. Makana appealed for pan-Xhosa unity; for confidence in their moral universe. Dali'dephu would sweep the whites away; the Xhosa dead would return; 'a new era would begin'. 26 Conceptual and symbolic innovations such as Makana's had a relevance which long outlasted the particular resistance with which they were first associated.

This period included some of the worst years of economic depression in the history of the modern world. By the end of the 1920s the imperial powers themselves were experiencing the pressures of a deepening recession, culminating in the Great Depression. The colonies of North-East Africa had been feeling the economic squeeze a decade or two before the Great Depression hit the industrialized world.\nFor North-East Africa yet another characteristic of the inter-war years was that they witnessed both a further expansion of imperialism, on one side, and a new militancy against imperialism on the other. The years between the two world wars were the years of Europe's last frontier - as new territory was annexed and colonial control was consolidated. This was imperialism's last territorial push in Africa.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours.

A preliminary point to make is the distinction between the expression of nationalism in Europe from the nineteenth century and that in colonized Africa in the period between the two world wars. Nationalism in Europe has been the expression of the desire of communities which accepted the fact of common cultural identities, coupled with a common historical past, for an independent, sovereign existence in political organizations (states) of their own. The struggle was to ensure a coincidence between the cultural nation and the organization of its political life as a state. As the Greek, Italian and German examples illustrate, what emerged from the nationalist movements were, by and large, nation-states.\nIn Africa, the aspirations of the states and groups which fought against European empire builders and tried to prevent the establishment of the colonial system up to the outbreak of the First World War were in essence the same as those which imbued the nationalist movements in Europe. However, one feature of the war was that it ended with the imperial lords consolidating their positions vis-à-vis the defenders of African independ› ence and sovereignty. In spite of the ferment of ideas which contributed to undermining imperialism as a system, colonial rule became a de facto situation to the extent that some authors have referred to the inter-war period as the 'golden age' of colonialism in Africa.\nMost of the colonies that had been created were made up of several culturally and historically diverse nationality groups for whom, for the most part, the fact of subjection to a common alien ruler was the main base for unity. The colonial situation represented for all a new setting in which they had to forge new identities of alien rule. In such situations colonial boundaries which in nearly all cases incorporated many cultural nations under a common imperial administration were taken as given. The forging of new identities began with the acceptance of the essential African-ness of the various cultural nations.

In the Union, there were also pass laws and Acts against vagrancy, the penalty for which was required, if minimally paid, labour.

In Brunschwig\'s view there has been over many centuries in Africa a struggle between the adaptation of, and the resistance to, externally derived ideas. The \'adaptors\' created the great Sudanic empires: the resisters endeavoured to repudiate them. The adaptors made use of the enlarging principles of Islam and Christianity: the resisters drew upon what Brunschwig calls \'animism\' and \'ethnicity\'. Long before colonialism there had been \'innumerable revolts\' against African innovators; most of the resistance to colonialism sprang from the same \'animist\' and \'ethnic\' roots. Modern African nationalism and pan-Africanism, on the other hand, are manifestations of the tendency towards centralizing in› novation and the adoption of \'large\' ideas, and thus stand in a tradition quite opposite to that of resistance. 36 Writing from the \'left\' a number of other historians have challenged the postulated link between resistance and nationalism on the grounds that this is an intellectual device to allow the ruling, and sometimes selfish, minorities of the new states to claim revolutionary legitimacy. Steinhart has made the most explicit statement of this challenge: \'Instead of examining anti-colonial resistance through the distorting lens of nationalist mythology, we must create a better "myth", one better suited to interpreting the reality of African protest ... A "myth" of revolutionary upsurge may lead us further and deeper in our understanding of twentieth-century move› ments of protest and liberation than the failing "myth of nationalism" has brought us.\' In this way Steinhart seeks to claim the heritage of the resistances for radical anti-authoritarian protest within the new national states of Africa. 37 A more recent full-length study of resistance - Isaacman\'s book on African revolt in the Zambezi valley - implicitly seeks to deal with both Brunschwig\'s and Steinharte objections. Isaacman deals with Brunschwig by placing his emphasis not on the \'parochialisms\' of ethnic revolts but on the redefinitions of sovereignty which he claims to have taken place in the 1917 rising.

Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

What they have found bears little resemblance either to the \'fanatical witch-doctors\' of colonial reports, or to \'the magic of despair\'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that \'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for "primary resistances" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.\' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. \'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine\'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the \'high priestess\' was dismissed and executed. \'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.\' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west.

At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined.

Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'. The European-controlled Atlantic trade, on the other hand, 'did not give rise to any productive forces: on the contrary, this caused a disintegration of society ...

But Cynthia Brantley Smith, in her admirable and exhaustive account of the Giriama, establishes that she was no sort of religious leader: merely a respected and assertive woman.$^{28}$ This is a case in which a retranslation of colonialist terms like 'witch' and 'witch-doctor' is not enough to correct the distortion of official accounts. It has been suggested by two researchers on Ndebele and Shona history that the same is true of my own account of the 1896 risings in Southern Rhodesia; the British South Africa Company said the risings were fomented by 'witch› doctors'; I argued that they were powered by a profound prophetic ideology; Julian Cobbing and David Beach assert that the spirit mediums were of much more restricted influence than I allowed and that the priests of Mwari participated in the risings hardly at all.$^{29}$ It will perhaps not be found surprising that I am unready for such drastic revisions. But it certainly is true that recent work on African religion in Southern Rhodesia shows that its relationship to resistance cannot have been so straightforward as I had supposed. It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements.

Similarly, the Zionist churches were often led by charismatic anti-European prophets who held out an apocalyptic vision and the hope of a reconstructed society free of oppression and white rule. \' 5 Despite close state surveillance, independent churches periodically engaged in explicit insurgent activities.

'His powerful mind and religious genius ... moulded a body of doctrine which was to serve as an ideological dynamo for the Xhosa nation.' In some ways Makana's teaching was an African version of the Protestant Christian ideology of sovereignty, which later gave Wittboi confidence in the divine right of the Red Captains. Makana explored the fundamental differences between black and white - different customs, different divinities, different destinies. The creator was Dali'dephu, great ancestor of the Xhosa, who had made Uthixo to be the god of the white men. Uthixo was an inferior to Dali'dephu, and the white men were morally the inferior of the Xhosa - continually vexed with the idea of sin. But this difference did not matter until the two moral universes came into contact and into conflict; then Dali'dephu would assert himself to ensure that his own particular children, the Xhosa, and their own particular and superior way of life triumphed over the super› ficial powers of the whites. Makana appealed for pan-Xhosa unity; for confidence in their moral universe. Dali'dephu would sweep the whites away; the Xhosa dead would return; 'a new era would begin'. 26 Conceptual and symbolic innovations such as Makana's had a relevance which long outlasted the particular resistance with which they were first associated. So far from being desperate nonsense, prophetic messages of this kind were a systematic attempt to widen and redefine the idea of deity and its relation to the moral order, and involved wide-ranging changes in Xhosa internal assumptions and relationships as well as providing the 'bedrock of ideology for resistance'.
