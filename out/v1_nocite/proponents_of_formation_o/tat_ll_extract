Conspicuous among this class are those worthy personages who, believing firmly and devoutly in the fulfilment of Divine prophecy, are as firmly and devoutly convinced that the realisation comes too slow, too tardily, to suit our own progressive age. And, accordingly, Providence should be "jogged-on,"—to use a somewhat irreverent, but meaning phrase—and man should come forward in order to realise the promises of Holy Writ. The restoration of Palestine and its colonisation by our brethren have always been the favourites among many such prophetic promises of the Scriptures. Countless have been the projects by which Providence was to be holpen, and our return facilitated; countless the individuals who have thus sought to hasten the fulfilment of the Scriptures. Our columns have for weeks past contained numbers of letters from scholarly and accomplished gentlemen, regarding the colonisation of Palestine, in one fashion or other; some advocating its purchase outright from the Turkish Government; others its gradual redemption; many, again, the despatch hither of a few thousands of our oppressed Russian brethren, as the advance guard of the main body of Jews.

{'document_title': 'The Eastern Question and Russo-Turkish War, with regard to the Jews and Judea', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There have been projects, none of which have had any happy result, for Christian industrial immigration into those countries from England and Germany. But since the whole range of colonies appertaining to European Powers in all quarters of the earth, are open to Christian emigrants, surely they may spare to the Jewish people the ancient home of their race, which has eaten up and vomited forth all other would-be possessors. And of all the honour and glory obtained by those two great and mighty empires of Germany and Great Britain, none will be more enduring than that they will secure by the employment of their prestige and their power in this eminently Christian work of preparing a secure abiding and resting place for a people that have been scattered for eighteen centuries among all the nations of the earth; a place where they may again become a nation; a place where the ruins of their ancient cities are crying out to them to come and rebuild them; a place—countries which have been, and must again become in their hands, the glory of all lands. It is in England and in Germany, more than in all other European countries, that the Jews have obtained that political, social, and industrial preparation, which will enable them as a nation to rise rapidly in influence and power; and it becomes, therefore, especially the privileged work of their rulers to do "this great thing" for them. It is a "great thing," though easy of accomplishment. Steam has brought all countries in the world within easy reach of Syria and Palestine; and it must be borne in mind that however happily the Jew may find himself now situate in Germany, France, and England, it is not the same with millions of his race in other European, and in proximate Asiatic and African countries. There he is still the condemned, the despised, the spat upon, the anathematised, the more or less persecuted or ostracised. Circumstances, moreover, occur from time to time that are well calculated to make even the satisfied, wealth-possessing Jews, in countries where they are supposed to enjoy all the rights, privileges, and immunities of citizens, reflect upon the insecurity of all people who live among others by grace and sufferance; and between whom and their fellow-citizens there is a broad line of distinction, which, however it may in some individual instances obliterated, does nevertheless show, both clearly and strongly, that in a not inconceivable period of popular excitement and frenzy they might be again marked out thereby for evil. They will do well to bear in mind that the Greek Church abhors them; that Rome has not changed in its hatred or in its persecuting spirit, merely lacking the power at present to make these bear their fatal fruits; and that even in that free land of the West, the United States, they have been of late unpleasantly reminded that they are only tolerated, not beloved;* that their ostentatiously displayed wealth is an offence rather than a title to favour and affection; that there is an under-current of hatred, running beneath the generally smooth surface of social amenities. It is, indeed, their rapid increase in wealth and numbers during the present century, that renders it absolutely and imperatively necessary that they should now become a nation, **in a land of their own.** And since they can best serve the world\'s great interests by becoming so, I cannot but hope that Great Britain and Germany will resolutely undertake the preliminary work of moving the Turkish difficulties that stand in the way. Many Christians will, it is very likely, flock in with the Jews to Syria and Palestine, and aid materially in re-establishing them in their new old home, though they may not permanently remain there. Be it so. I care not how the work be done, so that it be done, and done quickly. I feel that in its being done, there will be a great escape from evil—a great attainment of good. During the present Eastern complications the Jews have made their influence collectively felt in a way never before attempted. I thought for a moment that the breath of national life had entered into them. But it was only a shaking among the dry bones in the Valley of Vision. The sinews and the flesh are coming up upon them; the four winds of Heaven are beginning to breathe upon them; and anon they will "stand upon their feet, a large army." This will be seen so soon as the preliminary action of Germany (whose fleet is at this moment off the coasts of Syria) and Great Britain shall have prepared the way for their return to their own old land.

We therein referred to the primary dispute (out of which grew the Crimean War) about the keys of the Holy Sepulchre, and pointed out that the clericalism of France, though for the moment voilée by the freethought of dominant Republicans, would ever be an opponent of Jewish restoration, in which it would be joined by the similar sentiment and superstition ineradicable in Russia. Two paragraphs in another column, copied from the daily papers, bear upon this point; though, strange to say, Russia appears to be urging the Porte to allow of the immigration of its Israelitish subjects into Judea, while France is unyielding in its determination to have a Governor, with French and Roman Catholic Maronite sympathies, appointed to the Lebanon. The Sultan, it is said, takes the alarm, and seems to be trembling for the Great Mosque on Mount Zion; he will not permit anything like colonization by Israelites in Judea or Syria, but only that they shall, if admitted to those lands, be dispersed among the general population! It is marvellous to see how these puny mortals thrust their straws of opposition and hate against the buckler of the Almighty. "Lift up your heads," we would say to the outcasts of Israel, "for your redemption draweth nigh." The time must be near at hand, though it will not come until the hearts of the scattered sons of Jacob are prepared for it. "Yet for this," saith the Lord, "will I be inquired of by the children of Israel to do it for them." We confess, our heart yearns for the time when the promise shall be fulfilled.

London: Johnson, 121, Fleet-street. 6d.\n\nIn his preface to this interesting little work the author states his purpose to be threefold: 1st, to give all accessible information, so that readers may form their own opinion; 2ndly, to show those Christians who think the latter chapters of Ezekiel to be unintelligibly mystical, that they are in error; 3rdly, to show that these chapters present the boundaries of a literal land and the ground plan of a literal building. We rejoice to see works of this nature issuing from the press. We feel very strongly that what are really luminous prophecies of events that are yet to take place on the earth have been so spiritualized away as to destroy but too much of that faith in the prophetical writings which would look for the approaching Advent of our Blessed Lord Jesus Christ to call His waiting, watching ones to the wedding supper of the Lamb; that, among their other wondrous blessings, they may escape those evils which are coming upon the earth; and to fulfil those glorious prophecies of Zechariah by events that will vindicate God\'s work in the past and lead to the glorifying of His great name in the future. We hope that most Christians now look upon the not distant return of the "seed of Abraham according to the flesh" to the Covenant land which it was promised they should possess, as a most sure and imminent certainty. It seems to us clear that this return will take place while the veil of unbelief in the Lord Jesus is still upon their hearts, which veil will only be removed after the visible descent of our Lord upon the Mount of Olives. No one, however, who has read Dr. Alexander Keith\'s admirable work, "The Land of Israel, according to the Covenant" (Edinburgh, 1843), could for a moment imagine that the whole of the land therein clearly proved to be included in the Covenant can be at first occupied and possessed by the returned children of Abraham, even should ten or twelve millions of them be gathered together there. Mr. Wassell, we think, is therefore right when, in the little work we are now noticing, with its territorial map, he assigns the early reoccupation of the Covenant land by the Covenant people within those limits so clearly defined by the Prophet Ezekiel. The return of the race of Israel to the land of their forefathers, will be an event of such momentous importance to the world at large, that everything connected therewith, whether in anticipation or in reality, justly merits our most earnest attention, and we recommend this plain, simple, unpretending, but valuable little work of Mr. Wassell to all our readers who are "looking forward to those things which are coming upon the earth."', 'last_edit_date': '1875-07-01T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1875#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.101}

* The return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel is seen as a fulfillment of biblical prophecies, particularly those in the book of Ezekiel, and is anticipated as a significant event in world history.
* The belief in the literal interpretation of biblical prophecies regarding the land of Israel suggests that some Christians in the 19th century viewed the establishment of a Jewish state as a divine mandate.
* The notion that the Jewish return to Israel would occur while they still do not recognize Jesus as the Messiah indicates a belief in a two-stage religious transformation, with the second stage occurring after a significant prophetic event.
* The territorial boundaries of the future Jewish state, as interpreted from biblical texts, were a subject of interest and debate among 19th-century Christian scholars, reflecting early Christian Zionist sentiments.
* The anticipation of the Jewish return to Israel was linked to broader eschatological beliefs about the end times and the second coming of Jesus, suggesting that the formation of Israel was seen as a precursor to these events.
* The work of authors like H. A. Wassell and Dr. Alexander Keith indicates that there was a scholarly effort to map and define the biblical land of Israel, which influenced both religious and political discussions about the region.
* The expectation of a Jewish return to Israel was not only a religious belief but also considered a matter of geopolitical significance, with implications for global events and the fulfillment of divine promises.

{'document_title': 'THE JEWS.—PALESTINE AND AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When, on Mount Carmel, the Prophet Elijah fought the Sacrificial duel in honour of his God with the four hundred and fifty priests of Baal, which ended in the defeat and destruction of the latter, he said to King Ahab, "Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain." There had been neither rain nor dew for three years, and there was grievous suffering because of the drought. Rain, and abundance of rain, was what Ahab and the people of Israel then desired. But though the prophetic ear of Elijah heard the sound of abundance of rain, there was no visible sign or token in the heavens of the promised coming showers. The sky was still like unto brass, as it had been at any time during the past three years. Elijah on the top of Carmel put his face between his knees, and sent his servant to look toward the sea. He looked, and said, "There is nothing." Six times did he thus go, and the answer was always the same. At the seventh view, however, he returned to the Prophet and said, "Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man\'s hand." So small and scarcely perceptible was the indication of the change described as almost immediately occurring, by the words: "Meanwhile the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain." The whole of this scene, recorded to have taken place two thousand eight hundred years ago, came across our mind as an electric flash while reading the first account of the strange demonstration against the Jews that had commenced in Berlin, the capital of the German Empire. We at once asked ourself—it was not the result of reflection or study, but a spontaneous action of the mind—"Is that demonstration the little cloud no bigger than a man\'s hand, but portending great coming results?" Having a conviction as strong as that of our own actual physical existence that the descendants of those who were carried away captive when the King of Assyria took Samaria two thousand six hundred years ago, and of those whom the Romans carried away as captives and otherwise drove out of Jerusalem and Palestine in the early ages of the Christian era, must and will possess the land which God assigned to Abraham and his seed for ever, we have been, as our old readers well know, a constant and earnest watcher of the progress of events in the south-east of Europe and the Turkish countries in Asia; always with reference to the glorious promises in Holy Scripture of the return of the wanderers of Israel and Judah to that land which is to be the glory of all lands when they are again established in it. What is to be the determining cause of their return has ever been a question in our mind. We knew that the partial, if not entire, dissolution of the Turkish Empire must precede that return; and so long ago as when the battle of Navarino was fought, and the great Turkish fleet was there destroyed, we said, "There is one note of preparation for the return of the seed of Jacob to Palestine." And ever and anon, as limb by limb has been severed from that once formidable Mahometan body, repeated notes of preparation have been ringing in our ear. But we have never yet heard the resemblance of the Prophet\'s forewarning "sound of abundance of rain" as applied to this great question of Israel\'s return. While the progress of events among the nations of Europe during the past hundred years has been gradually removing the international difficulties in the way of their return, pari passu their social and material position had become so ameliorated and improved; they have so enormously increased in wealth and recognized personal importance among the peoples with whom they dwell, that the longing desire which was known to exist among their persecuted and cruelly wronged forefathers to be again "a nation"—to be restored as a people to "their inheritance"—has been gradually dying out, and their wish has seemed rather to have become that they shall be (while still outwardly maintaining the religious observances that separate them) altogether nationally identified, English in England, French in France, Germans in Germany, &c. Their eyes are not turned toward Jerusalem. The enjoyments and pleasures, the amusements and distinctions now open to them, with the seemingly ever increasing power to get wealth, are all that they desire; and a Jewish imitation of Peter the Hermit, who should preach in their synagogues a return to the land of their forefathers, would more likely be stoned than followed. Far from feeling or showing the least inclination to secure the great heritage preserved for them, their faces (at least those of the richer Jews who govern the feelings and opinions of their poorer co-religionists) are set like flint against the Hill of Zion. They seem to say, "Let the eternal decree be what it may, we will not go to that land." A remarkable fact in proof of this came under our notice only a few days before we heard of the anti-Semitic movement in Berlin. Whether by the fault of the Jews or Roumanians we knew not, but for some time past it had been notorious that the former were in great disfavour in Roumania. An emigration of Jews from Roumania has consequently become necessary or advisable. Looking at the comparative proximity of Roumania to Syria, we had said, "Here will be a reinforcement to the Jewish element in Palestine. The Jewish population of Jerusalem has increased five thousand in five years; here will be an additional increase.

2. The anti-Semitic movements in Europe, such as those in Berlin, were perceived by some as potential catalysts for the Jewish return to Palestine, akin to prophetic signs of change.
3. Despite historical and religious prophecies about the return to Israel, many Jews in the 19th and early 20th centuries were more focused on integrating into European societies, valuing economic and social opportunities over a return to their ancestral homeland.
4. The reluctance of wealthier Jews to support a return to Israel highlights a division within the Jewish community between those who prioritized assimilation and those who held onto Zionist aspirations.
5. The emigration of Jews from regions like Romania was seen as an opportunity to bolster the Jewish presence in Palestine, indicating that regional anti-Semitism could indirectly contribute to the Zionist cause.
6. The narrative suggests a belief in a divine or prophetic destiny for the Jewish people to return to Israel, which was seen as inevitable despite contemporary social and political attitudes.
7. The comparison of historical events to biblical prophecies reflects a tendency to interpret modern political developments through a religious or eschatological lens, particularly in the context of Jewish history and aspirations.

{'document_title': 'The Eastern Question and Russo-Turkish War, with regard to the Jews and Judea', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The enormous wealth of individual members of the Jewish communities has given rise in some unreflecting minds to the crude notion, which has been floated in the European atmosphere by the public press, that a purchase of Syria and Palestine from the Sultan was on the point of being made by one or more of the rich Israelites. Such a purchase, if it included the fee simple of all the unoccupied lands, together with all public revenue rights over the whole of those countries, might in the course of time prove to be a profitable speculation, if a great human element were not mixed up inseparably with it. Such element, however, being thus mixed up with the Land and Government questions, the supposed operation is not likely, I should think, to recommend itself to any Jewish financial minds; while there is, moreover, an entire lack of evidence that the great wealth-possessing Jews look at the present time with any favour on the idea of the restoration of their race to those lands of their forefathers. Not only the great, but for the most part also the moderate wealth-possessing Jews, are quite content with their present lot in the great European countries, where they enjoy all the rights and immunities of their fellow-citizens; the sting of social disfavour has no longer much power to wound in communities where the love and idolatry of wealth spreads a social halo round him who has it; and who by possessing it has at his command all the luxuries, pleasures, diversions, and enjoyments, the scientific and artistic delights, which the advanced civilization and culture and abounding wealth of the age have to offer him. Their lot has now therefore fallen in such pleasant places, that the thought of lands in which all these things will have to be created, or must be dispensed with, is distasteful rather than attractive to them. The lack of all those things which are now their delight would afflict their souls, as did the memory of the "flesh which they did eat in Egypt freely, the cucumbers and melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic," the souls of their rebellious forefathers in the wilderness (Numbers xi. 5). Vanity, luxury, pride; the love of pleasure, amusement, and all sensuous delights, possess their hearts in common with those of the people among whom they now dwell; and are mixed up in them with the inextinguishable thirst for increasing riches, which finds its best beverage where wealth abounds. Such men are not likely to be the first to pine for the Hill of Zion; to be ready by self-sacrifice to regain it for their race. The impulse thitherward is more likely to grow and spread and intensify among the humbler multitude, which has supplied the pioneers of the new-born immigration; the foremost waves of the great human element to which allusion has been made, as being mixed up with the question of lands and revenues in Palestine. It may be that if the purchase of Syria and Palestine would bring with it rule and title, a princely or a kingly throne, there might be found a man or men belonging to the race who would be tempted to the investment. Who can tell, however, what form of government the Jewish people, restored in adequate numbers to compose a nation, would inaugurate or submit to? No one. The peopling of Syria and Palestine by Jews can only, therefore, be looked for through the resistless operation of a growing, spreading, intensifying impulse among the masses, which, working upward into the richer grades, will eventually embrace them also; as it will, I doubt not, meanwhile be assisted by them, with that generous charity they as a rule so creditably display, especially toward their co-religionists. An immigration such as has been already commenced by individual action will be rapidly cumulative if no new deterrent obstacles crop up; and if such as now exist be diminished or removed. And this is where the interposition, aid, and creation of facilities by the hand of power seem to me to be necessary, and indeed indispensable, if it be desired that such cumulative immigration should assume national proportions, and produce speedily national results. An established government must be continued in those countries while this immigration is taking place. That government must, I think, nominally at least, be Turkish; and so continue, until the reassembling nation be sufficiently restored to enable it to arrange for entire self-government. I say nominally, because the continuance of Turkish rule ought not to be allowed to include the continuance of Turkish oppression, spoliation, and insecurity. The sting, the destroying venom, should, and must, be taken out of it. As these were to a great extent taken out of it in the Lebanon, so must they be taken out of it throughout Syria and Palestine. This can only be accomplished by foreign intervention and pressure. Such intervention and pressure need not be other than friendly. It is especially desirable that it should possess that character, and if undertaken by the only two European Powers who, by their principles of government, and the feelings and opinion of the majority of their people, are fitted to exercise it, it would do so. These two Powers are Great Britain and Germany. Neither of these is under the influence of Rome; neither of these has any designs upon the Holy Sepulchre; the subjects of both are intensely manufacturing and commercial, and pre-eminently interested in keeping open links of trading communication with the far East and its great hordes of peoples, who may be stimulated into becoming large consumers of European manufactures. To both these great countries, as indeed to the whole of Central and Southern Europe, it is important that the rich uncultivated wastes of the world should be made productive; that the quantity of produce exchangeable for manufactures should be augmented; that the once famous ports of the world that fringed the shores of the Mediterranean, the coasts of Syria and Judea, Tyre, Sidon, Cæsarea, Jaffa, Acre, &c., should be restored to their ancient efficiency, which can be easily effected by the re-employment of the abounding ruins of their former greatness, their ready, at hand for use on the spot. Egypt, Syria, and Palestine must become again the granary and garden for the use and delight of Europe, as they were in their full development under Roman rule. Let Great Britain and Germany make the furtherance of these objects and results the keystone of their Eastern policy, and the work will soon be inaugurated and pressing onward toward accomplishment. All that will be necessary on their part is to procure the agreement with Constantinople, that under their aegis there shall be such full security for life and property, such entire freedom from capricious tyranny, government and official spoliation, and interference with land and industry, their produce and their fruits, that those who take and purchase lands, those who cultivate and build and trade, should have all possible guarantees that good and well-regulated government can give, of tranquil and assured possession of their properties and the fruits of their labour and industry, their talent and their enterprise, by themselves and their descendants. This is not much for one government to ask of another, and to exact from another, in these last days of the nineteenth century, with regard more especially to countries which, like Syria and Palestine, appeal more or less to the sympathies of the whole civilized world; and the adequate peopling of which, together with the full development of their unexhausted natural resources, are indispensable to that world\'s enjoyments and interests. The future of the East on the one hand, and of Central and Eastern Africa on the other, is bound up with Egypt as regards the one, and with Syria and Palestine as regards the other. It is already settled in the world\'s opinion that Egypt, on the influences prevailing in and governing which the destruction of the East and Central African Foreign Slave-trade (that bitter curse continued now through Mahomedan exigencies alone) and the civilization and development of East and Central Africa depend, must in some way or other become subject, directly or indirectly, to the sovereign will and power of Great Britain. The world\'s needs, as well as British interests, require it; and it is in course of certain accomplishment. In like manner, the great work of the world\'s regeneration in Eastern lands, must and can only be adequately promoted by the exercise of British and German influence, procuring for Syria and Palestine the benefits already pointed out, which may and will be sufficient to attract to them the people to whom they legitimately appertain, and by whom alone, I am fully convinced, they can be permanently inhabited. They are the home of the Jews, the appointed portion of the earth\'s surface for the Jews, and they will return with that enormous wealth which they have toiled for and diligently gathered in all lands.\n[August 1, 1877.]', 'last_edit_date': '1877-08-01T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1877#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.1}

Found low level hypotheses:
The passage suggests that the resettlement of Jews in Syria and Palestine could be economically motivated, driven by the potential profitability of developing the land and restoring its ancient ports and agricultural productivity.
The claim is made that wealthy Jews of the time were not inclined to support the restoration of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, as they were content with their status and comforts in Europe. This suggests a hypothesis that early Zionist movements were more grassroots, driven by less affluent Jews.
The passage posits that the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine would require the intervention and support of European powers, specifically Great Britain and Germany, to ensure security and governance. This raises the hypothesis that European geopolitical interests played a significant role in the formation of Israel.
The passage implies that the restoration of Jewish presence in Palestine is not only a matter of economic or political interest but also of cultural and religious significance, suggesting a hypothesis that the Zionist movement was deeply intertwined with Jewish identity and heritage.
The text connects the future of Central and Eastern Africa with the geopolitical developments in Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, suggesting a hypothesis that the establishment of a Jewish state could have broader implications for the development and civilization of Africa, particularly in relation to the suppression of the slave trade.
The passage argues for the necessity of foreign intervention to mitigate Turkish oppression in Palestine, suggesting a hypothesis that the decline of Ottoman influence was a critical factor in the eventual establishment of Israel.
The text suggests that Jewish immigration to Palestine would be a gradual, cumulative process, driven by a growing impulse among the masses rather than immediate large-scale migration, indicating a hypothesis about the organic growth of the Zionist movement.
The passage highlights the importance of restoring trade routes and economic productivity in the region, suggesting a hypothesis that global trade interests were a significant factor in the support for a Jewish homeland.

* The establishment of Israel in 1948 might have served as a precedent or inspiration for African nations seeking independence from colonial rule.
* The support or opposition to the formation of Israel by various African countries could have been influenced by their colonial rulers' policies and international alliances.
* The African diaspora, particularly those with Jewish heritage, may have played a role in advocating for or against the formation of Israel, impacting African perspectives on the issue.
* The geopolitical dynamics of the Middle East, including the formation of Israel, may have affected African trade routes and economic policies during the colonial period.

Found low level hypotheses:
* The British intervention in Egypt was perceived by some as a step towards the fulfillment of a promise regarding the children of Jacob, possibly hinting at the establishment of a Jewish homeland.
* The geopolitical maneuvers involving Russia, Austria, and Germany in regions like Salonica and the Dardanelles were seen as interconnected events leading towards the realization of a significant historical promise.
* The establishment of Israel was viewed by some as an inevitable outcome influenced by a series of international political and commercial actions, even if those actions were not intentionally aimed at this goal.
* The belief in a divine or historical promise regarding the children of Jacob influenced interpretations of political events in Africa and the Middle East during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
* The narrative of a promised homeland for the children of Jacob was intertwined with European colonial and political interests in Africa, particularly in regions like Egypt.
