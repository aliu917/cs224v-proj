The claim that the Ashanti Kingdom was a collection of various kingdoms held together by fear of punishment, and its oppressive rule led to a desire for independence among vassal states, is supported and nuanced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa describes the Ashanti's imposition of political domination over other Akan peoples, including the enforcement of the Asantehene's oath and the requirement for leaders to attend the Odwira ceremony, as mechanisms of control that could foster resentment. The demand for tribute and use of military force to maintain control over non-Akan states like the Dagomba and Gonja further suggest coercion. However, the textbook also highlights integrative institutions, such as the mystical bond of the Golden Stool and the participation of chiefs in the Asantehene's enthronement, which fostered unity and legitimacy beyond mere fear. The Ashanti's efficient political and administrative organization provided stability and benefits to member states, and while there were instances of resistance, such as the Asante uprising of 1900, these were not solely attributed to oppressive rule but also to external pressures like British colonialism. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the Ashanti Kingdom's composition of various kingdoms, such as Becqua, Kokofo, Mampom, Adansi, and Juabin, which retained traditions of independent sovereignty and were held together more by fear of punishment. The articles highlight the oppressive nature of Ashanti rule, with examples like the Chief of Adansi and his people seeking protection from a stronger power due to oppression, and the Chiefs of Becqua and Juabin resisting Ashanti subjugation. These details align with the claim that oppressive rule led to a desire for independence among vassal states, presenting a complex picture of the Ashanti Kingdom's governance.

The British military intervention significantly weakened the Ashanti Kingdom, leading to the secession of states and impacting trade routes, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook details how British military campaigns, notably the decisive defeat by General Garnet Wolseley's forces in 1874, led to the disintegration of the Asante empire. The Treaty of Fomena forced Asante to recognize the independence of its southern vassal states, and the weakening of Asante's military power encouraged northern vassal states to break away. The British further instigated member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, leading to internal conflicts and civil war. The subsequent annexation of Asante in 1901 solidified British control and disrupted Asante's political and economic structures. Although the textbook does not explicitly mention trade routes, the disruption of political control and secession of states likely affected trade dynamics. The African Times articles complement this by highlighting the Ashanti Kingdom's lack of homogeneity, held together more by fear than unity. British intervention prompted the Chief of Adansi and his people to migrate into the British Protectorate, while the Chief of Becqua and the King of Juabin sought to resist Ashanti control. The articles also note that Ashanti's control over trade routes was disrupted, breaking the cordon that prevented tribes from reaching the coast, thus opening trade opportunities for other regions. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive narrative supporting the claim that British intervention weakened the Ashanti Kingdom, leading to state secessions and impacting trade routes.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights that support the claim that the British aimed to consolidate control over the Gold Coast region, integrating Ashanti territories into a single colonial entity. The textbook details British efforts to subdue the Asante through military campaigns, such as the decisive defeat in 1874 and the annexation of Asante in 1901. It highlights British strategies like instigating internal divisions within the Asante Union and offering protection to Asante, alongside attempts to station a British Resident in Kumasi, indicating their intent to integrate the region into their colonial framework. The annexation of the Northern Territories in 1901 further underscores British consolidation efforts. However, the textbook also notes the resistance and diplomatic efforts by Asante leaders, such as Prempeh's rejection of British offers and his diplomatic mission to England, illustrating the complexities and challenges faced by the British. Similarly, The African Times articles describe a series of military engagements, culminating in the British conquest of Kumasi in 1874, as part of a long-term strategy to subdue the Ashanti. The articles reflect a belief in the inevitability of British consolidation, suggesting that Providence would eventually unify the Gold Coast, including the Ashanti, under British rule. While the articles do not explicitly state British intentions to integrate the territories into a single colonial entity, the historical context and reflections align with the claim of British consolidation efforts. Together, these sources illustrate the British strategies and actions aimed at consolidating control over the Gold Coast and integrating Ashanti territories, while also acknowledging the resistance and complexities involved.

The "General History of Africa" textbook does not explicitly address the portrayal of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence as a justification for British colonial actions. Instead, it focuses on the military confrontations between the Asante and the British, the political and economic consequences of these conflicts, and the broader context of colonial rule in Africa. The text highlights strategic and military engagements, such as battles and treaties, and the subsequent disintegration of the Asante empire, while discussing British tactics of "divide and conquer" and the use of diplomacy and military superiority to establish control. This absence of information on the portrayal of Kumasi in such a manner suggests that the textbook neither supports nor refutes this particular justification for British colonial actions. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide a portrayal of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence, aligning with the claim that such depictions were used to justify British colonial actions. The articles describe Kumasi as a "blood-deluged town" and the palace as the "head-quarters of human sacrifice," framing the British actions as a moral and necessary intervention against a "wanton shedder of human blood." While the articles do not explicitly state that these depictions were used to justify colonial actions, the exaggerated fear and population estimates suggest a narrative constructed to amplify the perceived threat of Kumasi, potentially serving as a justification for British intervention. Overall, the articles align with the claim by depicting Kumasi in a manner that could rationalize colonial actions, but they do not directly address the use of these portrayals as a justification.

The decline of Kumasi, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, reflects broader colonial impacts on African towns, though each source provides different perspectives. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the political and military defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874, leading to the disintegration of the Asante empire, political instability, and the weakening of traditional governance structures. However, it does not explicitly link these events to changes in Kumasi's infrastructure and population, focusing instead on the socio-political consequences of colonial rule, such as the imposition of European-planned taxes. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim of Kumasi's decline in infrastructure and population. They describe a significant reduction in population, from a potential 80,000 during grand occasions to possibly less than 5,000 residents after the 1874 expedition. This population decline is mirrored in the town's infrastructure, with roads overgrown and narrowed, and formerly numerous Dampans reduced to dilapidated structures. The desolate appearance of Kumasi, with many houses in ruins and the absence of a king, underscores the town's deterioration. While the articles suggest a loss of leadership and resources possibly due to colonial disruptions, they do not explicitly link these changes to colonialism, leaving room for interpretation regarding the direct causes of Kumasi's decline. Together, these observations illustrate the multifaceted impacts of colonialism on Kumasi, encompassing both political instability and tangible declines in infrastructure and population.

The Ashanti Kingdom's military engagements with the British were marked by significant battles, underscoring the strategic importance of the region, as evidenced by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa details a long tradition of confrontation beginning in the 1760s, with notable military engagements such as the battle of 1824, where the Ashanti defeated the British and killed their commander, Sir Charles MacCarthy. This was followed by the British avenging their defeat at the battle of Dodowa in 1826. The strategic importance of the region is further highlighted by the British launching a well-organized campaign under General Garnet Wolseley in 1874, resulting in the sacking of Kumasi and the decisive defeat of the Ashanti, leading to the disintegration of the Ashanti empire and the recognition of the independence of vassal states. The British annexation of Ashanti in 1901 following the last Kumasi expedition in 1900 further underscores the region's significance. The African Times complements this by highlighting significant battles such as those at Essamacow and Effootoo in 1824, and Accra in 1826, which resulted in a crushing loss for the Ashanti. These engagements, along with repeated attempts at negotiation and trade, such as efforts by Geo. Blankson to open trade routes, emphasize the region's importance. The culmination of these conflicts in the war of 1873-1874 and the eventual conquest of Kumasi by the British in 1874 further illustrate the persistent military and strategic focus on the Ashanti Kingdom. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the broader strategic importance of the region beyond these military engagements, which is a slight divergence from the textbook's broader perspective.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim of British colonial influence in the region, affecting local governance and social dynamics. The General History of Africa highlights the establishment of centralized administrative systems by the British, which replaced traditional social and political institutions. This included the appointment of colonial chiefs, the introduction of direct taxes, and the imposition of modern currencies and banking institutions, all of which disrupted traditional authority and social structures. The British interest in abolishing the slave trade and establishing legitimate trade led to treaties that eroded the sovereignty of local rulers, with British troops and administrators enforcing these new systems, often through force or coercion. While the textbook does not explicitly mention British flags as symbols of colonial influence, The African Times articles provide this detail, noting a British flag waving in Mansu and the presence of Houssa troops, indicating a military presence. The articles also mention rebuilding efforts in Dunkwa, possibly implying colonial financial support and intervention, though they do not explicitly discuss the impact on governance or social dynamics. Together, these sources illustrate a comprehensive picture of British colonial influence, marked by both administrative changes and symbolic military presence, affecting the region's governance and social fabric.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the historical context of trade and travel in West Africa, though neither directly addresses the specific claim about the journey from Kumasi to the coast. The General History of Africa highlights the strategic importance of coastal trading posts and the Asante's efforts to control European trading posts, suggesting the significance of routes leading to these posts, such as those from Kumasi. However, it does not provide specific details about the journey from Kumasi to the coast or the challenges of travel and communication along this route. Instead, it focuses on the broader context of trade routes and networks, including the movement of goods like gold and kola nuts. In contrast, The African Times articles offer a brief account of a journey from Kwisa to Cape Coast, noting a duration of exactly five weeks, which might imply travel challenges, but they lack explicit details about these difficulties or the strategic importance of Kumasi in trade networks. The articles do not mention Kumasi, focusing instead on Kwisa and Cape Coast, highlighting a gap in the narrative regarding the historical context of travel and trade in the region. Together, these sources underscore the absence of direct evidence to support or refute the claim, while hinting at the broader significance of trade routes in West Africa.
