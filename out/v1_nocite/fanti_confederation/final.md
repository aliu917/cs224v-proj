The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles strongly support the claim that the Fanti Confederation's emphasis on education and infrastructure development suggests a progressive vision for societal advancement. The Constitution of the Fante Confederation, drawn up in 1874, explicitly aimed to establish schools for educating all children within the Confederation and to promote industrial training, as evidenced by Clause 22, which called for normal schools to educate scholars in various trades such as carpentry and agriculture. This aligns with the articles' mention of the erection of school-houses and the establishment of schools, underscoring a commitment to education as a means for societal progress. Both sources highlight the Confederation's focus on infrastructure development, with the textbook noting the aim to develop substantial roads and the articles detailing the construction of good and substantial roads throughout the interior districts. Additionally, the Confederation's promotion of agricultural and industrial pursuits, as well as the development of the country's mineral resources, reflects a forward-thinking approach to economic and social development. The spirit of cooperation between the educated elite and traditional rulers, considered revolutionary, and the unity among the Fanti kings and chiefs for the betterment of their people further underscore this progressive vision. However, the textbook notes the British suppression of this initiative by 1873 as a significant hindrance to its realization, contrasting with the claim's implication of successful implementation. Despite this, there is no information in the articles that refutes the claim, indicating a strong alignment between the Confederation's stated goals and the claim of a progressive vision for societal advancement.

The Fanti Confederation's efforts to establish a centralized leadership structure represent an early attempt at organized governance among African kingdoms, as detailed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles.
