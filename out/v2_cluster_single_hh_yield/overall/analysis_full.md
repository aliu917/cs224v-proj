## The passage argues that Africa, having been long-neglected, requires external intervention for industrial and moral regeneration to address its challenges and advance the triumph of good over evil.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that Africa requires external intervention for industrial and moral regeneration. The "General History of Africa" offers a nuanced view, highlighting Africa's historical interactions with external forces, particularly during the colonial period. It acknowledges the internal efforts of African leaders in the nineteenth century to reform their societies, often undermined by European intervention. While the text discusses the role of missionaries and colonial powers in shaping Africa's political and social landscape, sometimes justifying intervention for security and economic opportunities, it also emphasizes the negative impact of colonialism as a subversion of African self-development. Additionally, it notes the influence of Afro-American interactions and pan-African movements, suggesting Africa was engaged in dynamic exchanges with the diaspora, thus not entirely neglected. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim, emphasizing the need for Africa to be "roused to industrial vigour and productive activity" and advocating for external intervention through the African-Aid Society and Christian civilization to combat the "torpor of barbarism." The articles suggest that "good must be forced upon her" through material benefits leading to moral change, aligning with the belief in the necessity of external efforts to address Africa's challenges and advance the triumph of good over evil. While the articles do not explicitly mention Africa as "long-neglected," they imply a need for significant change and development. Together, these sources provide a complex picture of Africa's historical and contemporary challenges, with the textbook offering a more balanced view of internal initiatives and external influences, while the articles advocate for external involvement in Africa's regeneration.

* **Black American evangelism in Africa**: Indeed, Afro-Americans in the nineteenth century were exhorted to assume a special stance toward the 'redemption' of African societies. Bishop Turner, for one, boldly argued that 'God brought the Negro to America and Christianized him so that he might go back to Africa and redeem that land'.$^{27}$ Others alluded to the future political greatness of Africa as well as divine mission as compelling reasons for New World blacks to act. For example, in a 1902 speech, blacks were told, 'if the Negro American will but feel his responsibility, face his opportunity and undertake the evangelization of Africa in God's name, unborn millions ... of Africa's sons will witness a transformed continent'. 28 Earlier, in 1884, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church spon› sored a major symposium on the question: 'What Should be the Policy of Colored Americans Toward Africa?'. In August 1893, African and other participants from the United States and Europe attended an American Missionary Association 'World Congress on Africa', held in conjunction with the Chicago World Fair of that year. The week-long Congress was intended to promote interest in Afro-American missionary work in Africa, and also in the rights of 'Africans in America'.
* **Introduction**: The djihäd movements of Islamic reformation covered the whole of the Sudanic zone of West Africa, and the eastern Sahara up to Cyrenaica, and spread south to the borders of the forest region as their impact reached Senegambia and the Voltaic regions, the southern Mandinka, northern Yoruba and the Edo-speaking peoples. As the European demand for palm oil, peanuts, ivory, sisal and rubber grew and the internal network of long› distance trade routes responded to these demands, trade became a major factor affecting access to firearms and the acquisition of wealth, and hence the rise and fall of states over wide areas of Africa. As a consequence of this expanding European trade and the activities of European and American missionaries, Christianity and European ideas of social and political organ› ization also became factors of change over a wide area stretching from Sierra Leone to Southern Africa and Madagascar.
What stands out most prominently in these different movements is the efforts of various African leaders in the nineteenth century in different parts of the continent to reform their societies. Some of the efforts were inspired by the heritage of cultures in Africa, others by reformist ideas in Islam. In most cases, the leaders were only too ready to take advantage of opportunities offered by the expanding scope of trade and the activities of Europeans, whether traders or missionaries, hunters of game or hunters of concessions. Another feature that stands out just as prominently was how these efforts of African leaders to reform were systematically being undermined by the very activities of European traders, missionaries and hunters that African leaders tried to exploit.
It is remarkable how little attention so far has been paid to this feature of the nineteenth century: of internal efforts at reform systematically being aborted by external intervention. Because of the assumption that colonialism and integration into the world economy were necessary con› ditions of modernization, most historians have failed to notice how much the nineteenth century represented an African effort at self-development and to what extent European conquest and colonialism was a subversion of that effort.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa**: The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began. As European nations increasingly became interested in the acquisition of African territories, the missionaries paved the way in some areas of Africa and served, quite consciously, as agents for European colonialism. Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans. Missionaries therefore enthusiastically encouraged European intervention as a morally justified undertaking, especially from the 1870s onwards.
* **Perspective**: It is therefore necessary in this introductory chapter to focus attention on Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century, to survey the general characteristics and tendencies of the period, the nature and extent of continuities with the past, the innovations and new departures, and the tendencies for the future. It is only by tackling this problem at the beginning of the volume that we can hope at the end to be in a position to consider the nature of African development during the century and the extent to which the European factor is to be regarded as 'a necessary precondition of the development of African societies, technical, cultural and moral',$^{4}$ or the predominant cause of African underdevelopment.
* **Conclusions**: In broad pan-Africanist terms, however, the evidence seems clear that African political and ideological visions were expanded and technical expertise was improved because of colonial African interactions with American blacks. The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.
Africans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.
Viewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.
In sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora. This latter vision seemed not so much to discard as simply to vindicate and to reorientate to an African perspective the idealism implied in the earlier vision.
* **Back-to-Africa movements**: Because of his general appeal to black pride, Garvey focused the attention of millions of American blacks on Africa in the period following the First World War. Dr Du Bois later observed that 'within a few years [of Garvey's rise], news of his movement, of his promises and plans, reached Europe and Asia, and penetrated every corner of Africa'.$^{5}$ His travels in the Caribbean, Central and South America and a two-year sojourn in Britain persuaded Garvey that the uniform plight of blacks required a militant self-help programme. Two specific aspects of his London experience affected his thinking; the reading of Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery (1899), because of which he later said he was 'doomed' to become a race leader,$^{6}$ and his encounter with the Egyptian intellectual Duse Muhammed Ali, a staunch critic of Britain and American African policies in his book In the Land of the Pharaohs (1911). Duse himself had earlier travelled and worked briefly as a stage actor and political activist in the United States before settling in London.
After returning to Jamaica, in 1914 Garvey founded his project designed to advance African emigration and related programmes and called it the Universal Negro Improvement and Conservation Association and African Communities League (later simply the UNIA). At the age of 28, Garvey went to the United States attracted by Washington's work, fired by Duse's example, and armed with a programme of race redemption: the establish› ment of industrial and agricultural schools for blacks in Jamaica, a Black Star fleet of ships for commerce between blacks in Africa and the Americas, and, most of all, a 'central nation for the race'. Liberia, long a focus of Afro-American emigrationism, became the lodestone for Garvey's emigra› tion schemes.
* ****: Never in the history of Africa did so many changes occur and with such speed as they did between 1880 and 1935. Indeed, the most fundamental and dramatic - though tragic - of these changes took place in the much shorter period from 1890 to 1910, the period that saw the conquest and occupation of virtually the whole continent of Africa by the imperial powers and the establishment of the colonial system. The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system. The pace of this drama was truly astonishing, for as late as 1880 only very limited areas of Africa had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In the whole of West Africa, only the island and coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Freetown and its environs (now in Sierra Leone), the southern parts of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the coastal areas of Abidjan in Ivory Coast and Porto Novo in Dahomey (now Benin) and the island of Lagos (in what is now Nigeria) had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In North Africa, it was only Algeria that had by 1880 been colonized by the French. Not an inch of the whole of East Africa had come under the control of any European power, while only the coastal stretches of Mozambique and Angola of the whole of Central Africa were being ruled by the Portuguese. It was only in Southern Africa that foreign rule had not only been firmly implanted but had even been extended a considerable distance inland (see Fig. 1.1). In short, by as late as 1880, about as much as 80% of the continent of Africa was being ruled by her own kings, queens, clan and lineage heads, in empires, kingdoms, communities and polities of various sizes and shapes.
* ****: By 1935, as is evident from the earlier chapters of this volume, colonialism had been firmly fastened on Africa like a steel grid, and it looked as if it was going to remain there forever. However, colonialism proved just as ephemeral as any other institution created and maintained by force. Within a matter of only some forty-five years from 1935, the colonial system had been uprooted from over 90% of Africa and confined only to that part of the continent south of the Limpopo River. That is to say, colonial› ism lasted in most parts of Africa for under a hundred years, indeed from the 1880s to the 1960s. In the history of a people and a whole continent, this is a very brief span indeed. How and why this incredible feat of the uprooting of colonialism was accomplished, or, to quote the words of Margery Perham, why this 'astonishingly rapid emancipation since 1950' ' form two of the main themes of the concluding volume of this History. In the concluding chapter of this volume, however, we would like to address ourselves to two main questions. First, what legacies did colonialism bequeath to Africa, or what impact did it make on Africa? The second question is, in view of this impact or balance sheet, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa? Does it constitute a revolutionary or important episode in the history of the continent? Was it a major break with the past of the continent, or was it, after all, a mere passing event which did not constitute a break in the history of the continent? Or as L. H. Gann and Peter Duignan have posed the same question, what is 'the place of the colonial era within the wider context of African history'? 2
* **Back-to-Africa movements**: While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'. Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.
After the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States. But no one made so deep an impression as an advocate of emigration on Africans and American blacks alike as did Marcus Garvey who was born in Jamaica in 1887.
* **The state of African preparedness**: Above all, following the abolition of the hideous and inhuman traffic in slaves, the Africans had been able to change over to an economy based on the exportation of cash crops - palm oil in Nigeria, groundnuts in Senegal and The Gambia - all before 1880 and cocoa had just been re› introduced into the Gold Coast by Tetteh Quashie from Fernando Po in 1879. And all this had occurred without the establishment of any direct European rule except in small pockets on the coast. Indeed, the relatively small group of West Africans who had benefited from European-style education were-by 1880 - doing extremely well. They were dominating the few civil service posts offered by European administrations; on the coast, some of them were running their own import-export businesses and were monopolizing the internal distribution of imported goods. It was in East Africa that European influences were still minimal, although after the epoch-making journeys of Livingstone and Stanley and the subsequent propaganda by missionary societies, it was only a matter of time before churches and schools, and with them roads and railways, would make their appearance.
As far as Africans were concerned, then, they did not see any need for any radical change in their centuries-old relations with Europe, and they were confident that if the Europeans wanted to force any changes on them and push their way inland, they would be able to stop them as they had been able to do for the last two or three hundred years. Hence the note of confidence, if not of defiance, that rings through the words quoted above.
* **The structure of Volume VII**: It is evident, then, that relations between Africans and Europeans did undergo a revolutionary change and Africa was faced with a serious colonial challenge between 1880 and 1935. What then were the origins of this phenomenal challenge, the challenge of colonialism? Or put differently, how and why did the three-centuries-old relations between Africa and Europe undergo such drastic and fundamental change during this period? How was the colonial system established in Africa and what measures, political, economic, psychological and ideological, were adopted to underpin the system? How prepared was Africa to face and how did she face this challenge and with what success? Which of the new changes were accepted and which were rejected? What of the old was retained and what was destroyed? What adaptations and accommodations were made? How many institutions were undermined, or how many disintegrated? What were the effects of all this on Africa, its peoples and their political, social and economic structures and institutions? Finally, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa and her history? These are the questions that this volume will attempt to answer.
For the purpose of answering these questions, and explaining African initiatives and responses in the face of the colonial challenge, this volume has been divided, apart from the first two chapters, into three main sections. Each section is preceded by a chapter (3, 13, 22) in which the theme of the section is surveyed in a general way and from a continental perspective, and the subsequent chapters are dealt with on a regional basis. The intro› ductory section comprising this and the next chapter discusses African attitudes and preparedness on the eve of this fundamental change in the relations between Africa and the Europeans, and the reasons for the par› tition, conquest and occupation of Africa by the European imperial powers. It should be pointed out, since this is often ignored, that the phase of actual conquest was preceded by years of negotiation and treaty-making between the imperial powers and African rulers. This phase of negotiation shows that the European powers originally accepted their African counter› parts as their equals, and, secondly, that the former did recognize the sovereignty and independence of the African states and polities.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Global strategy**: stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy thesis, informed reactions have been largely negative. Its attraction, however, for non-Africanist historians or for the lay reader - has been simply overwhelming. Yet we know that this thesis, developed from the more eclectic assumptions of Langer$^{23}$ and the more considered analysis of Hinsley, is too neat and too circumstantial to be acceptable. It has been tested in West, Central, Southern and East Africa and found wanting.$^{24}$ And with respect to Egypt and North Africa, it has been shown that there were strong reasons unconnected with Britain's Indian imperial strategy necessitating a British presence.$^{25}$ It is gratifying to note that Robinson, at any rate, has begun to de-emphasize the exagger- ated repercussions of the baton Egyptien on the Scramble elsewhere in Africa. 26
* **Implications of incorporation**: There is no need to exaggerate the role of external forces in African statebuilding. The internal forces were the primary mechanism of political evolution and the existing logics of development account for most of the particular details. Furthermore states were constructed in this same era which were quite remote from the world-economy as, for example, the Rozvi.$^{35}$ Also it is quite obvious, by looking at the West African states, that there is an imperfect connection between participation in the slave-trade and state-formation. If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.
The outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process. But the fact that such a pressure group existed and played a role in the process is not an explanation of the process but one of the aspects of it that needs to be explained.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review**: There is need, therefore, to bring sanity to the jumble of theories regarding this crucial movement in African history. They may be conveniently cate- gorized as follows: economic, psychological, diplomatic, and the African dimension.
* **The structure of Volume VII**: The second section deals with a theme that had until the 1960s either been grossly misrepresented or entirely ignored by the colonial school of African historiography, namely, African initiatives and reactions in the face of the conquest and occupation of Africa. To the members of this school such as H. H. Johnston, Sir Alan Burns and, more recently, Margery Perham, Lewis H. Gann and Peter Duignan,$^{10}$ Africans in fact welcomed the establishment of colonial rule since not only did it save them from anarchy and internecine warfare but it also brought them some concrete benefits. Thus Margery Perham: most of the tribes quickly accepted European rule as part of an irresist› ible order, one which brought many benefits, above all peace, and exciting novelties, railways and roads, lamps, bicycles, ploughs, new foods and crops, and all that could be acquired and experienced in town and city. For the ruling classes, traditional or created, it brought a new strength and security of status and new forms of wealth and power. For many years after annexation, though there was much bewilderment, revolts were very few, and there does not appear to have been much sense of indignity at being ruled. ' ' Such ideas are also reflected in the use of such Eurocentric terms as 'pacification', Pax Britannica and Pax Gallica used to describe what amounted to the conquest and occupation of Africa between 1890 and 1914. Those historians who did pay some attention to this subject mentioned it almost accidentally or casually. In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies. It is to correct this wrong interpretation of the colonial school and to redress the balance and highlight the African perspective that we have devoted as many as seven chapters to this theme of African initiatives and reactions.
* **The diaspora and Africa**: While Africans who came to the New World can be numbered in millions, their descendants who returned to Africa amounted to only a few thousands.$^{56}$ Many reasons account for this, not the least of which was the significant lack of support to establish the type of transportation system which had previously facilitated the westward trans-Atlantic flow. Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found. Garvey's organization had branches in Canada, the USA, the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa.$^{57}$ By the time that Garvey's organization collapsed in 1927, Africa, and especially the Ethiopian question, had already begun to assume paramount importance in world affairs.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: TO THE SECRETARY OF THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY AND EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES, 8, ADELPHI-TERRACE, LONDON.**

Dahomey, Nov. 30, 1861.

Sir,—After reading the African Times, and finding the objects of your society, feelings of joy impel me to employ myself in any way I can, possibly, to aid you with all dependable information, that the kind African friends may see the wants of the objects on whom they desire to show mercy, and may He, the Father of Light, ever bless and crown their labour with abundance of success! I have not the least doubt but that the mind of the African friends in Christian England will be stimulated to employ all power within their means to make an end of the inhumanity in the kingdom of Dahomey, when they become acquainted with what is going on now, and what has passed in the months of July and August last.
* **Capabilities of Africa**: 4. And her climate is mild (West and Central Africa)—no excessive heat or cold. And why should not Africa become a great country? Only let the proper means be used, and, with God's blessing, she shall be. Dear brother, I hope the African-Aid Society may prove a great blessing to Africa and the world. May God give all needed wisdom to guide you aright, and grant His rich blessing, is my desire.—Yours, for the redemption of this long-neglected land and people,

George Thompson.

P.S. Our country, as you know, is passing through a fiery ordeal. May she come out purged from her abominations, and yet become a "nation whose God is the Lord!" The expectation is more and more general that the days of slavery are being rapidly numbered. God grant it! is the prayer of many tens of thousands.
* **1863 AND 1864, AND THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.**: filthiness, she glories in her vileness, and feels no need of renovation. Good must be forced upon her. She must be won, if possible, through material benefits to a moral change. The life of civilization must be brought to bear upon the torpor of barbarism. Africa must be roused to industrial vigour and productive activity before high aspirations can take the place of vile and disgusting cravings. To organise and urge on the army of regeneration is the work in which we of the African-Aid Society are engaged. It is a comparatively slow and arduous work. The forces are so disproportioned, if only numerically contrasted; and we are not surprised that they who only thus contrast the forces and estimate the progress of the work, should feel discouragement. But if they will rise to the height of so great a mission, that discouragement will give place to noble and enthusiastic, to vigorous and patient effort. The infidel may sneer at the prophecy of "the sweet singer of Israel," and taunt us with the centuries that have passed away since he predicted that she should "soon" stretch out her hands unto God (although that "soon" was not soon after the delivery of the prophecy, but soon after certain events then also foretold). But they will feel with us, that time, in the eternal councils, is not measured by the standard of presumptuous human unbelief. The promise is sure. Good shall prevail over evil in Africa as elsewhere. How will the victory be achieved? Not without human agency. The workers of material regeneration must be with the van of the army. All the forces of Christian civilization must move on together. Civilised government, industrial development, employment of capital, commercial enterprise, scientific power, must march shoulder to shoulder with moral and spiritual teaching and example. Christianity is for this world as well as for the next; it ameliorates the present in its every condition and relation, while pointing to the perfect future. And the misguided individual who would set about renovating and civilising Africa without the life-bestowing aid of Christianity, might be as profitably engaged in making sandrope cables for the ships of Her Majesty's navy.
* **Another Year**: With this new year we urge, therefore, upon all the friends of progress and civilization in Africa to ask themselves to what extent they ought to consider themselves called upon to contribute during this year to that advancing triumph, to that increased development, to those augmented agencies? The work has to be done, and some must therefore be working. Who then? Who but those who have already put their hands to the plough; who but those who with more or less of heartiness and sincere desire to stem the tide of moral and material misery—to staunch the bleeding wounds—of Africa, have already made some effort on her behalf in the past. Expressions of sympathy, expressions of disgust, will of themselves have no efficacy. These will not advance the cause of God and of humanity even by a single foot-length. When unaccompanied by deeds, these only deserve contempt. Standing upon the watch-tower for Africa, we are witnesses to but too much of that cheap protest against the influence of the powers of evil which God calls upon every enlightened Christian man to combat. We call, therefore, earnestly upon all who affect to care in any way for Africa, and for the triumph of good over evil within her blood-stained borders, to be up and doing. We care not which of the effective agencies alluded to they may support and aid. But let them support some one or more—let them aid some one or more. We implore them not to measure too nicely whether this or that missionary or other society engaged in the great, the arduous, and noble work, gives them their full pound's worth of accomplished good for the sovereign they may have invested. Let those who can work, work; let those who can better give than work in any other way, work by giving. At this advanced hour of the world's limited existence, we ought all to be working in some way or other for God and good; and there is no field of labour in which greater efforts are required than in Africa.

## The King of Dahomey perpetuated the practice of human sacrifices as a deeply entrenched cultural and religious ritual to assert power, maintain social and political control, and resist external pressures, despite concerns from missionaries and the local Christian community.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the King of Dahomey perpetuated human sacrifices as a deeply entrenched cultural and religious ritual to assert power, maintain social and political control, and resist external pressures. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim, focusing instead on Dahomey's resistance to British and French abolitionist demands to end the slave trade and its economic transition to palm oil under King Gezo. This suggests a broader reluctance to abandon traditional practices under external pressure, though it does not specifically address human sacrifices. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed support for the claim, describing the King's annual customs involving human sacrifices as a means to instill fear, assert dominance, and retaliate against English interference in the slave trade. The articles emphasize the King's resistance to external pressures, including those from missionaries and the British government, and highlight the religious aspect of appeasing evil spirits through sacrifices. Despite the efforts of missionaries like Mr. Bernasko and concerns from the local Christian community, the King maintained these rituals, viewing them as essential to his authority and social order. While the General History of Africa provides context on Dahomey's economic and cultural adaptations, The African Times aligns more closely with the claim by illustrating the cultural, religious, and political significance of human sacrifices in Dahomey, underscoring the challenges faced by those attempting to intervene.

* **The Cross river basin > The Ekpe society and the Bloodmen**: The Ekpe society of Calabar was an adaptation of a cult of the leopard present among many forest groups in the Cross river valley and in parts of the Cameroon. It was played as a masquerade by the young men, wearing hooded raffia costumes, while women and non-members shut themselves up in their houses. But the main function of the members was to hold weekly meetings at which social questions were discussed.
The Ekpe society, which, in the hinterland village communities, com› prised all elders, became an exclusive secret organization in the large commercial community of Calabar. It also became increasingly stratified into grades, rising from five recorded in 1828 to ten in 1840 and eleven in Ekpe was the effective law-making and enforcing authority in Calabar in the nineteenth century, and was utilized for the purpose by the foreign visitors as well. Thus, in 1850, the missionaries, supercargoes, and consul pressed the leaders of Calabar to enact an Ekpe law against human sacrifice at the deaths of rulers. Ekpe may be considered to have been an asset in the political system of Calabar in that it united all the free men of wealth and influence in a common organization. But its discrimination against the large body of men of slave origin and the poor led to the social disturbances of the mid-nineteenth century, which Dike has referred to as slave revolts.
The association of plantation slaves known as the Bloodmen came into being specifically as a pressure group to prevent the sacrifice of slaves at the deaths of kings and lineage heads. Such an organization of slaves on a blood oath was possible in Calabar because of their concentration in plantations, and because of the common disabilities they suffered. However, the association did not become a revolt for the emancipation of slaves, or even for the seizure of political power from the Ekpe. All the association achieved was to come into Calabar from the plantations in a body each time a notable man was ill or died, and there was danger of slaves being sacrificed or made to take poison ordeal. Their agitation led to the 1850-1 Ekpe law against human sacrifice, and King Archibong I considered it necessary to secure their support in the faction fights over the office of obong.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The local power structure was also designed to provide a place for the older Fulbe clans which could not aspire to the office of amir: the jooro (village headmen) were selected from the ranks of the heads of families of more ancient lineage. Jelgoji had a similar system for incorporating all clans within a single structure: the chief was elected by an electoral college made up of aged notables of SadaabØ descent, i.e. representatives of the people who had been dominant in the region before the arrival of the JelgobØ, whereas only a member of the latter could actually be chief. In practice, the chief was invariably a member of the Nyorgo family. The insignia of the office was a staff (symbolizing stock-breeding) hung with various kinds of agricultural products. Here again, the material prosperity of the new chiefs reign was secured by means of sacrifices carried out by the indigenous Kurumba.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.
Nevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Traditional African religion in the pre-colonial period**: Traditional African religion was, and still is, inextricably bound up with African culture. It was a pervasive force, and as Emmanuel Obiechina aptly puts it: There is hardly any important area of human experience which is not linked to the supernatural and the people's sense of religion and religious piety ... these ... are part and parcel of the ideological structure of traditional society, and so essential to a proper interpreta› tion of experience in the traditional social context. 1
This pervasiveness of religion through the total way of life of African peoples gave traditional religion a remarkable wholeness within the context of the culture out of which it originated.
It was based on a particular world view, which included not only the people's view of the supernatural but also their understanding of the nature of the universe, the nature of human beings and their place in the world, and the nature of God, who was known by various local names. Essentially a spirit, God had no images or physical representations and was acknowledged as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. Power, justice, beneficence and eternity were attributed to Him, and as the Source of all Power, God had power over life and death. He rewarded men but also punished them when they went wrong and was in many ways likened to the Overlord of Society and was the Final Authority in all matters. On the whole, God was unlike human beings and was completely above His creation, but at the same time, He was involved in the affairs of men, sustaining creation and upholding the moral order. Human beings depended upon Him as a Power superior to them. God was therefore transcendent as well as immanent.
There was a hierarchy of spirits. Below God were the ancestral spirits, which were always treated with reverence and with awe, and then there were also the deities or gods who were believed to have the power of rewarding human beings or punishing them with misfortune, disease or even death. The divinities had their cults, priests and shrines and there were some among them which were associated with various features of the environment: but these palpable objects were the abodes of the gods and not the gods themselves.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Traditional African religion in the pre-colonial period**: In addition to these supernatural entities, there were other spirits or mystical powers which were recognized and reckoned with for their ability to aid or harm human beings. Included in these were agents of witchcraft, magic and sorcery. Finally, there were charms, amulets and talismans which were used for protective as well as offensive purposes.
The general conception of man was that he was a compound of immaterial and material substance. The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities. Human society was an unbroken family made up of the dead, the living and the yet unborn.
With regard to man's relation to society, being human meant belonging to a community and that involved participating in the beliefs, ceremonies, rituals and festivals ofthat community$^{2}$ and membership of the community was emphasized more than a member's individuality. For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife. An individual did not stay in one stage of existence for ever; he necessarily moved on to the next, and in order to make the transition smooth, special rites were performed to ensure that no breaks occurred, and movement and regeneration continued perpetually. 3
African traditional religion was not only pervasive, it also bound men to the unseen powers and helped them to form correct relations with the non-human powers; it also bound men to their fellow human beings.
Religion acted as the cement which held societies together, providing them with support and stability. Furthermore, traditional religion helped men to understand and control events, to relieve doubt, anxiety and guilt.
* **The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14 > The Ogowe basin and surrounding regions 23**: However, despite the deep inroads made by Western influences, the indigenous societies were able to retain their identity. For it must be pointed out that, towards the end of the nineteenth century, vast regions were still all but unaffected by these alien influences. Even where, as on the coast, such influences were already very powerful, they ran up against various forms ofdiehard opposition from the local cultures. Thus the largescale effort to evangelize the local populations had to contend with such widespread indigenous cults as Bwiti, Bieri and Ombwiri, and social customs such as polygamy.
* **African traditional religion and colonial rule**: Africans used their religion as a weapon to resist colonial rule and its threat to their values, and often relied on magic and the intervention of their ancestors and gods in their fight against colonial oppression. In the first two decades of this century, the Igbo warriors of south-eastern Nigeria resorted to such means to defend themselves from alien invaders. The Esza people of Abakaliki Division, the Uzuakoli and the Aro may be cited as examples.$^{6}$ Some cults were clearly a focus for resistance to colonial rule, such as the Mwari in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), or secret associations like the Poro in Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa. War-charm movements also occurred in Madagascar and the Congo basin. In East Africa, especially Kenya, African prophets arose to provide spiritual reinvigoration$^{7}$ to resist colonialism, such as occurred in the Machakos District among the people of Kilungu in the early months of 1922 (see Chapter 26). One of the best-known movements which used both religion and magic to resist colonial rule and oppression was the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa during the first decade of the twen› tieth century.$^{8}$ (See Fig. 7.1.) Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities. Besides, the movement provided the seed for African nationalism which was later to germinate and blossom into the struggle for independ› ence and its final achievement in the 1960s.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The political organization of Liptako represented an attempt to maintain a balance between the clans, and this was reflected in its very structures. Power was transmitted through patrilineal descent from Saidu, the father of that Brahima who had led the djihäd. However, the Ferrobe eventually decided or agreed that their antagonists, the Torodbe, should constitute the electoral college that designated the amir. The college investigated each candidate's personal qualities, such as justice and piety, as well as the services he had rendered, the extent of his matrimonial alliances, and the like, and finally gave a decision. By means of this participation, the Torodbe, even though they were debarred from wielding power themselves, were placed in a position where they could in a sense decide among the Ferrobe claimants, and this served to integrate them into the system. 43 Once the new amir had been tentatively selected, he was subjected to an interview and asked trick questions. Then animals were sacrificed to the genii and to a sacred snake. A new traditional drum was made, to be included among the symbols of power granted by the Sokoto council. 44 The new amir's head was swathed in a turban by one of the Torodbe in the presence of the chief imam and the kadi, and facing the standard he swore to respect the customs and principles of Islam and to maintain the welfare of his people. This was a ritual of political and religious renewal of cosmic dimensions, designed to appease supernatural forces of all descriptions. The religious authorities were appointed by the kadi of Dori and were invested with judicial power as courts of appeal. In addition, there was a network of village imams, headed by the chief imam of Dori.
* **On the eve of the nineteenth century**: Allowing for differences in detail, the Shona and Lunda states were structured around similar organizational principles. At the apex stood a king believed to have sacred qualities that were either inherent in kingship or acquired through rites of investiture. The ruler's intimate relationship with the supernatural, sanctified by spirit mediums and cult priests, ensured the health and well-being of his subjects and the fertility of the land. The interrelationship between kingship and fertility underpinned the mys› tification of the ruler and reinforced his position as symbolic owner and spiritual guardian of the land. As a result, he retained the exclusive right to allocate land, which was the basis of control over subordinate chiefs and other subjects and underpinned a cycle of reciprocity. In repayment for the opportunity to use the king's land and benefit from his divine prowess, his subjects were expected to provide specified taxes, labour service and tribute that varied from one kingdom to another. Throughout both state systems, moreover, the largest tusk of a dead elephant automatically belonged to the monarch as owner of the land. In some societies, such as Manica, the Lunda of Kazembe, and Undi, the monarch also maintained a theoretical monopoly over commerce, while in Changamire's kingdom the ruler was the ultimate owner of most cattle.$^{5}$ These tribute, labour and commercial arrangements enhanced the power and wealth of the monarch, who redistributed to his principal lieutenants a portion of the surplus which he extracted, to ensure their continued loyalty. In this respect the precolonial central African states organized the flow of scarce resources from the dominated classes to the dominant class. 6
* **Socio-economic tensions > Social change**: Artisans were denied the rights enjoyed by freemen and nobles, and were reduced to endogamy. While a noble could marry slave girls, he could not marry a blacksmith's daughter.$^{58}$ And yet, like the griot, whose verbal magic consolidated the power of the rulers and even gave him a very small share of it, the blacksmith was feared because of the magical nature of his work. He was also a mediator in conflicts between individuals and families. However, there was no shortage of subjects of tension. 59 In the Mossi kingdom of Wagadugu, slaves were made into eunuchs in sufficiently large numbers for it to be feasible to export them northward. In Asante, the quantity of human livestock obtained by the payment of tribute was so great that when the slave trade was abolished, the Asantehene stated that he could not feed the 20 000 captives whom he had on his hands, adding, 'unless I kill or sell them, they will grow strong and kill my people'. 60 It appears, however, that social relations between slaves and their owners were marked by less hostility in societies not having a central power structure. We are told that in the village of Pura, slaves were fed 'just like everyone else'. M. PŁre tells us that in the Lobi country, each submatriclan was divided into two groups: the true-born Weya, and the Dea, who were of captive origin. The latter category included people who had been adopted because they had been found at the door one morning, seeking refuge from famine or raiding. Both categories, however, were fully integrated within the social structure as sources of production and progeny. Accordingly, a slave lived in the same hut as his master, whom he addressed as 'father'; he was a member of the same kin group as the latter and was subject to the same rituals and taboos and engaged in the same work; his owner gave him a wife, he possessed a field, and was entitled to accumulate cowries to the point of buying his freedom or purchasing another man to replace him. What was required of him was that he remain in the same village as his master.$^{61}$ Here we see a clear indication of a deliberate policy of using slavery as a means of strengthening clan or territorial groups.
* ****: The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions. It was also a cultural imposition and it used culture to buttress the political, economic and social superstructure which colonial› ism represented. It is the religious aspect of this cultural imposition of colonialism and the African response to it that this chapter deals with.
* **African traditional religion and colonial rule**: Another cult similar to Majï Majï was the Nyabingi cult, which also covered a wide area and cut across ethnic and regional boundaries and was found in Ruanda (now Rwanda), north-western Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and Uganda. Like the followers of Majï Majï its adherents believed that the power of its medicines could neutralize the effect of European bullets, as well as believing in possession by the spirits of legendary ancestors. It began during the late nineteenth century and gathered momentum until it finally broke out in 1928 in revolt against European occupation in the Kigezi region of Uganda. (See Fig. 7.1.) As E. Hopkins put it, 'the movement succeeded in immobilizing the admini› strative efforts of three colonial powers for nearly two decades until its final suppression in 1928'.$^{9}$ The Germans, and the Belgians who took over Ruanda from them after the First World War, failed to suppress it, and even after the suppression of the 1928 uprising, the cult lingered on until it was finally suppressed in 1934.
Other cults gathered force against the European pressure by reviving aspects of traditional religion and combining them with ideas borrowed from Christianity. Such, for example, was the Mumbo cult which was used by the Gusii people, near Lake Victoria in Kenya, as the buttress of their revolt against British colonialism which began in 1900.$^{10}$ (See Fig. 7.1.)
In the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the British colonial, administration adopted a hostile attitude towards certain religious practices, abolished some and endeavoured to suppress certain deities and cults. Thus the cult of Katawere, the tutelary deity of Akim Kotoku, was prohibited by the government in 1907. ' ' Prior to this the German government had destroyed the shrines of the cult of Denteh of Kete-Krachi in the 1880s and the priest of Denteh had been imprisoned and executed by the government. The Krobo people were forced to abandon their settlements on the Krobo mountain by the British colonial administration which destroyed their settlements and suppressed the cult of their tutelary shrines of Kotoklo and Nadu.
* **The theatrical arts**: The disruption of political life in Oyo, where the troupes had enjoyed the protection of a stable monarchy, did not long enhance the further dis› semination (and secularization) of theatre. For by then, the missionaries had begun their own northward drive from the first footholds on the coast, usually only a few steps ahead of arms-backed commercial companies. ' 2 They completed the task which Islam had begun by forbidding their adherents membership of any cult. These theatre companies were run like family guilds, with the familiar practice of trade secrets and initiatory rites; their material was also firmly rooted in the traditional - all of which qualified them for definition as devilish, sinister cults. The Christian missionaries, like the Muslims, did not content themselves with banning only the performances. Like the mbira in Southern Africa, instruments which were associated with such theatre arts were banished with equal vigour. A vacuum was thus created into which the returnee slaves' culture neatly stepped. The slave trade had been instrumental to the process of religious conversion on the west coast even as it proved detrimental to cultural life, as manifested, in the affected societies. The missionary com› pounds and spheres of influence, just as in Southern Africa, guaranteed some measure of safety, so did submission to the Muslim overlords: the price of safety was inevitable renunciation of authentic art. Now the cycle of cultural substitution began to close: having broken up the cultural life of the people, the slave era, now in its dying phase, brought back the sons of the land with a new culture in place of the old. ' 3 Victory was not so simple, however. 'Pagan' theatre withstood the onslaught, not only preserving its forms but turning itself consciously into a base of resistance against Christian culture. So durable had it proved that it was to participate, in various forms, in experimentations which the colonial elite now embarked upon for a meaningful theatre. For now, as the century entered its last three decades, the west coast came under the creative influence of these returnee Christians, confident in the superiority of their acquired arts, eager to prove to the white colonials who now controlled their existence that the black man was capable not only of receiving, but of practising the refined arts of the European. There was only one fortunate complication: despite this conscious drive which made them cut themselves off culturally from the indigenous peoples of the hinterland, the latter remained 'comfortably and firmly attached
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: Brahima Saidu, who had been nothing more than the jooro (village headman) of Weedu, a post to which he had been appointed by the GulmancØ chief of Kaola, became an atniiru (atnlr) and launched a holy war, which ended with the Gulmanceba being pushed southward, although extensive regions of mixed population remained. However, the other Fulbe clans (the Tukuloor and the Waakambe) objected to the growing power of Brahima Saidu. They sent a delegation to complain to Shaykh 'Uthmân, who replied that while it was undoubtedly 'preferable to leave power to him to whom God has destined it', he did not see why they themselves had not declared a holy war, inasmuch as they had been established in that 'pagan' environment longer than had the Ferrobe.$^{40}$ Sokoto always put its political and religious influence behind the new dynasty and intervened on occasions, as for example in 1890, to settle disputes between rival claimants to the emirate. In return, the amir of Dori provided Sokoto with little enough: no military assistance was sent, and the yearly tribute in kind (grain, livestock, slaves and cloth) could not be supplied, as often as not, because of the unsafe condition of the roads, especially after the empire was divided up and Dori became subject to the rule of Gwandu. Specifically, the Kebbi rising, and subsequently Arewa and the Zamberma, constituted a formidable barrier. The djihad of Massina on the other hand, had little impact on the chieftaincies of Jiibo and Barbulle, where the influence of the traditional religions prevailed. In addition, although Jiibo and Barbulle paid tribute to Hamdallahi until 1858, they did not regard themselves as subject to the rule of Massina,$^{41}$ perhaps because the latter had no local representative. In practice, at any rate, they enjoyed autonomy. The tribute thus represented an act of deference. It may also have been intended to anticipate any possible attempt at conquest. From the standpoint of Massina, the tribute was presumably the practical expression of its suzer› ainty, which it would have liked to strengthen. An opportunity presented itself in 1858,$^{42}$ in connection with a dispute over the succession in Barbulle.
* ****: A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination. What was true in 1976 can be seen as having been even more commonplace in that more dramatic period of external domina› tion in Africa, when an entire people, its social organizations, and its economic and artistic patterns became subjugated to strategies for maximum exploitation by outside interests. The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word. The Arabic dimension was unique in its own right, an ambivalent face of expansionism which none the less left strong cultural impressions on the landscape. Yet the reality that we extract from that period is the resilience and even increased vitality of the forms and values of the authentic cultures of the peoples.
* **Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Ethiopia**: The lord possessed certain rights known as gulf, essentially the right to collect tribute in kind from each household in the district and to appropriate labour for work on his farms or on other projects he might designate. Part of the tribute was retained for his own use, and the remainder was transmitted to his overlord - the provincial governor. He adjudicated cases and disputes in the district, mobilized and commanded the local militia, and organized public works to develop the district (besides ensuring that his 'parish', often coterminous with the district, discharged its obligations to the local Ethiopian Orthodox church).$^{14}$ As a rule, the obligations due to the lord or church from the district's population, based primarily on their attachment to land for livelihood, were comparatively light in the Amhara-Tigre core provinces. There, land was owned and controlled by the rist system, that is, mostly by individual lineages; it was practically inalienable and was therefore unavailable for distribution by the emperor or governor for patronage purposes. The obligations were heavy in the regions in the south and west conquered by Menelik, where the lords and naftanyas (literally 'gunbearers': settlers from the Abyssinian highlands) greatly exploited the people partly through gult rights and obligations. 1 5 The provincial governors performed functions similar to those of the lords but on a larger scale. Those in the Amhara-Tigre core were recruited mostly from the emperor's close relatives or from local noblemen presumed loyal to the emperor. Governors of the newly conquered regions in the south and west where alienable land was available, were predominantly Amhara, Shoan, Tigrean or other northern noble or military men who received gult rights (or rut-gult land in lieu of governorship) for their services to the emperor. Thus continued loyalty to the governor or emperor greatly depended on the availability of gult for rewards, and of military power to enforce authority. ' 6 The emperor was the most important single factor in the imperial system. He performed institutionalized executive, legislative, and judicial functions which have been classified by Christopher Clapham as 'protective', 'extrac› tive and distributive', 'regulative', and 'symbolic'. The emperor personally led his army, managed imperial affairs, and dispensed justice and patronage. More importantly perhaps, the emperor symbolized national unity and independence by virtue of his alleged descent from the Biblical King Solomon and
* **Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies**: Mirambo's method of control in his 'empire' was based on the imposition of military power on the traditional system..Conquered rulers were required to acknowledge his over-rule by occasionally sending him tributes of ivory and young men for his army. Where there was resistance from a traditional ruler, Mirambo removed him and replaced him with a more submissive member of the same ruling family. Where a conquered province was near a powerful kingdom, Mirambo kept armed men of his own there. But his main method of control was that of keeping his army constantly on the move to intimidate both his neighbours and his subjects.
Nyungu ya Mawe's 'empire' was better integrated than that of Mirambo. Nyungu ya Mawe, like Mirambo, used the ruga-ruga to establish himself among the Kimbu. Between 1870 and 1880 he campaigned from his base in Kiwele and gained control of the trade route to the coast east of Tabora and the southbound route from Tabora to Ufipa and Lake Tanganyika. Among the conquered states Nyungu posted his own officials called vatwale, who were directly responsible to him. In his 'empire' the real rulers were no longer the traditional chiefs but the appointed vatwale. It was the duty of these officials to collect and forward to Nyungu all the ivory obtained in the kingdom. The area under each appointed official consisted of a number of traditional states. Therefore the Kimbu traditional states, num› bering about thirty, were ruled by about six or seven vatwale. 11 Mirambo and Nyungu ya Mawe were contemporaries. Both built up polities based on the changed material conditions of the late nineteenth century. Both Nyungu and Mirambo died in 1884. Because Nyungu made innovations in the administrative structure of his 'empire', when he died it survived until it was dismantled by the colonialists. On the other hand, Mirambo's 'empire' broke up into its constituent states simply because there was no successor who could maintain the strong army required to keep it together.
* **Religious protest movements**: Not so easy to suppress was the Mumbo cult, a movement contempor› aneous with Ndonye wa Kauti's prophetism which outlasted Ndonye. This movement was rooted in the resentment of colonial authority which the Luo and the Abagusii shared. This resentment dated back to the wars of occupation the British had inflicted on the Abagusii in 1904 and 1908, and on the Luo of Alego in 1908-1 o.$^{7}$ But it was further ingrained because of the British coercion of these people to yield compulsory labour for road construction and for the settler farms. There was, in addition, the hated hut tax which weighed particularly heavily on those who were polygamous. The paternalism of the missionaries further fuelled this mood of resent› ment. As in Ukambani, the Abagusii began to look for new categories of thought that would hold forth promise for a better world view. They found this in the Luo Mumbo cult, a traditional lake spirit cult which was at the height of its influence in the nineteenth century. This cult found revitalization into a political movement for resistance to the white man's presence in the second decade of this century. In an epiphany in 1913 this Mumbo spirit addressed one Onyango Dunde of the Seje clan in Alego as follows: I have chosen you to be my mouth-piece. Go out and tell all Africans - and more especially the people of Alego that from henceforth I am their God. Those whom I choose personally and also who acknowledge me will be forever in plenty. Their crops will grow of themselves, and there will be no more need to work. I will cause cattle, sheep and goats to come out of the lake in great numbers to those who believe in me, but all unbelievers and their families and cattle will die out.
The Christian religion is rotten and so is its practice of making its believers wear clothes. My followers must let their hair grow and never wash. All Europeans are your enemies but the time is shortly coming when they will disappear from our country.
* **The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean**: A feature of this syncretism was observance of Catholic feast days and saints' days, together with recourse to the orixas and to voodoo. Thus, the feast days of the gods coincided with the dates of the Catholic saints' days. Bastide asserts that syncretism is no more than a white mask for Negro gods. The values of the two religions interpenetrate in varying degrees. In Brazil, for instance, a series of Catholic sacraments, such as baptism, are repeated not only for ritualistic purposes but also to give the individual additional strength. This acculturation of values of European origin marks even the forms closest to the African sources, such as candomblØ, macumba and other cults, some of which are close to, or even characterized by, magic. In the case oimacumba, attention should be drawn to the presence of Amerindian values, the acculturation here being of a threefold variety.
Examples of syncretism involving Amerindian culture can be seen in the West Indies, particularly in Honduras, where a mestizo people has emerged as the result of interbreeding between Amerindian women and Africans referred to as black Caribs.$^{73}$ These Africans were the descendants of the Igbo and Efik and, subsequently, of the Fante, Asante, Fon and Congo.
The 'African societies' gradually turned into 'black societies', varying in the strength of their connection with Africa and in their integration in society as a whole, in the sense of gaining full citizenship.
From the social standpoint, integration in society as a whole was keyed to the following variables: the type of society of the white colonizer; the form of land exploration; the religion of the colonizer - Protestant or Catholic; the percentage of Amerindians in the population and the degree of integration in the economic process imposed by the regime of the colonizer, either during the colonial period proper or following the attain› ment of independence by the Americas.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance. In some cases, the Dyula community became thoroughly assimilated into the local community. Such instances of total assimilation were rare, but I. Wilks, in his informative study,$^{36}$ points to one example - the Tagara of Jirapa in north-western Ghana. The process was insidious enough. As already discussed in the case of the funeral rites of the Koumina canton, the Africans retained their custodianship of land, both physically and ritualistically, so that while, in the towns, contacts with the French and Islamic 'civilizing' missions, demonstrated undeniable advantage for the converts, the seasonal 'commuting' between land and city itself displaced 'unsecured' groups and individuals. Such was the fate of the Dyula.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: It is a pleasure to the King of Dahomey to cut the heads off human beings, to show the strangers who visit him in the seasons of his annual customs, but especially to the English, or people connected with the English. His first reason is that the surrounding countries may fear him when they hear of it, so as to present themselves to him as his subjects; the second is that the English forbid his best trade, and that is in slaves; he will therefore kill everyone that he catches in war. Some of these poor victims of the Dahomian cutlass have to receive a good flogging, and from a sharp, cutting whip, while their necks are on the blocks ready for the cutlass. The cutting off their heads was not sufficient punishment for the crime of trying to defend themselves or to prevent their being kidnapped and sold for slavery. To say nothing of the number (upwards of 1,500) killed to be the attendants of the late King Gezo in the other world, with bullocks, rams, goats, cocks, drakes, and guinea fowls by the new King, in the great funeral custom of his late father, and who butchered the human beings just in the same way as he did the bullocks &c.—the blood of man and beasts mingled in one hole made on the ground at the gate of the palace—I shall only speak of what is going on now, and that of July and August last. I started from Whydah on the 4th of June, and reached Abomey on the 7th. On my arrival I missed several of the captains, and there were very few men in town. When I made inquiry I learnt that they were gone to attack some place. In about four days the King sent out about 1,600 men for another expedition. On the 15th those who went first returned to Abomey with 600 slaves, men, women, boys and girls, and forty heads of those who made resistance. I was called out to the King's gate to see the train. Each slave is followed by the one who caught him, holding the end of the string. How loud the sight cried for Christian England to help the weak against the mighty! The train comprised several grey-headed men and women. Some of them scarcely could walk. The sick among them were bound in cloth to poles, and carried. Their crime was that they did not come to the custom for his father, and they laughed at those who came from some towns behind them to present things to the King for the custom. The next day the slaves were delivered to the King; the very old ones were put aside to be killed, the young and the middle-aged were put aside to be sold.

Five days after this the second warriors returned with more than 200 slaves. Being disturbed in the counting, I did not get the correct number after the 200.

The slaves were brought to the King, as in the first case. As the captains passed before the King, they prayed him to hasten the time when Abbeokuta shall have no more name amongst the countries in the world.
* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: It is a pleasure to the King of Dahomey to cut the heads off human beings, to show the strangers who visit him in the seasons of his annual customs, but especially to the English, or people connected with the English. His first reason is that the surrounding countries may fear him when they hear of it, so as to present themselves to him as his subjects; the second is that the English forbid his best trade, and that is in slaves; he will therefore kill everyone that he catches in war. Some of these poor victims of the Dahomian cutlass have to receive a good flogging, and from a sharp, cutting whip, while their necks are on the blocks ready for the cutlass. The cutting off their heads was not sufficient punishment for the crime of trying to defend themselves or to prevent their being kidnapped and sold for slavery. To say nothing of the number (upwards of 1,500) killed to be the attendants of the late King Gezo in the other world, with bullocks, rams, goats, cocks, drakes, and guinea fowls by the new King, in the great funeral custom of his late father, and who butchered the human beings just in the same way as he did the bullocks &c.—the blood of man and beasts mingled in one hole made on the ground at the gate of the palace—I shall only speak of what is going on now, and that of July and August last. I started from Whydah on the 4th of June, and reached Abomey on the 7th. On my arrival I missed several of the captains, and there were very few men in town. When I made inquiry I learnt that they were gone to attack some place. In about four days the King sent out about 1,600 men for another expedition. On the 15th those who went first returned to Abomey with 600 slaves, men, women, boys and girls, and forty heads of those who made resistance. I was called out to the King's gate to see the train. Each slave is followed by the one who caught him, holding the end of the string. How loud the sight cried for Christian England to help the weak against the mighty!

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In the palace he, the King, sat just about the same place, but under a large tent surrounded by the Amazons. The chiefs and captains having passed round before the King with their silk dresses, and so on, about one o'clock they commenced passing with the furniture, cowries, and cloths, which are to be thrown to the people some few days to come. Presently came on two of the poor Ayors bound in baskets, each being carried by two of the Amazons. Next came an alligator and a cat, bound in the same way. Next came six of the Ayors. In the same manner a few other things passed, and then came four more, all bound as described, only in cases instead of baskets. His wives were the last, dressed with silks of different kinds.

The cowries, cloths, tobacco, and the other things, except the furniture, were thrown over to his people from a sort of platform on which he goes to stand, and the poor Ayors were thrown from the platform, except two he pardoned. These poor fellows were not criminals; they were people caught in war some time ago, and kept in prison. This custom lasted twenty days, and there were more than fifty killed before I left Kanna for Whydah.

The King was to start from Kanna to Abomey, to hold the Horses' Custom, but the month of September being evil moon to them, no custom must be held in it; so that the custom was postponed to October.

The King started at the appointed time for Abomey. All the Whydah chiefs who had returned home started again for Dahomey. The custom commenced as soon as the Yevoga of Whydah reached Dahomey.

Dahomey has two customs, which come in turns annually. One is Attor, and the other Sorsi. The former is a sort of platform erected (with sticks), on which the King has to sit or stand, to throw things to his people. The latter is a shed supported by several poles, and to each pole people appointed to be killed at a certain period of the custom are fastened one by one. The late King never exceeded thirty men at a time in all the days of his reign.

This latter custom is what is going on now.

Instead of one shed, he made double, one on the other, and ninety men fastened to the poles, and there was not one pardoned—every one was killed.

* **DAHOMEY**: The correspondents of the Wesleyan Missionary Society write from Abeokuta: "The King of Dahomey still threatens to invade Abeokuta in the month of November. May God grant that the calamity be averted, and that we and the Christian inhabitants may be kept in peace and safety!"

The Rev. William West, who has been visiting all the Wesleyan missionary stations on the Gold Coast, writes his impression from intelligence he has received from Mr. Bernasko at Abomey, that "a commissioner, appointed by the British Government, might possibly have some influence, as Mr. Bernasko says that the King is earnestly desirous of seeing a 'real Englishman,' to have a general talk with him. Mr. Bernasko says that the King has been very busy keeping custom for the last four or five weeks (his letter was dated the end of August), and that many have been killed; that some of the Christians brought from Ishagga have been sacrificed; but that he has been informed by some of the chief captains that those Christians who are still alive will be given up to him. I hope this will prove to be the case."

[We are sorry that we have no such hope. We do not believe that any of them have been spared; but if they have been, we feel quite confident that they will not be thus set at liberty. It is not at all our impression that the King of Dahomey will attack Abeokuta during this present month. His inroad into the Abeokutan territory last year was to have been made in November. It did not take place until March, when the alarm had partially subsided, and the people of that doomed place, Ishagga, were off their guard. The dry season, which begins in November, lasts till May, and the expedition against Abeokuta may be made at any time during that period.—Ed. A. T.]
* **LATEST FROM DAHOMEY.**: Under date of October 3rd, Mr. Bernasko reports to the Committee of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society his safe return to Whydah, on the 22nd of September, from another visit to Abomey.

The details of the cruelties witnessed by Mr. Bernasko are, as usual, sickening; but his expostulations with the King were apparently fruitless. Had his father abolished these evil practices, his Majesty said, he would not have resumed them; but as they had not been abolished previously to his entering on the kingdom, he could not venture to set them aside.

Mr. Bernasko was much interested in the fate of the remaining captives taken at Ishagga, and hoped to obtain their release; but was informed that they had died from the effects of their diet while in captivity. He put his own construction on this story.

One hopeful circumstance, however, appeared. The King seemed wishful to receive communications from the Government of England, and disappointed that those which had been opened with his father had not been continued. There seems reason to think that a properly-accredited messenger would not be unwelcome; and should the duties of his mission be judiciously discharged, it is possible that much good might result. The subject deserves the best consideration of Her Majesty's Government, with a view to some immediate action that might be instrumental in averting the threatened attack from Abeokuta. The King said that the Queen of England was great among the white people, while he, the King, was great among the black. The King had on a former occasion allowed Mr. Bernasko to take half-a-dozen children from Abomey to Whydah to educate. He now, however, refused to do so, saying Mr. Bernasko might educate as many as he liked of those in the English town of Whydah.

*Captain Bardley Wilmot was, twelve months since, appointed as Commissioner to the King of Dahomey, in conformity with the promise of Her Majesty's Government to the African-Aid Society, that one should, if possible, be sent. Some difference between Captain Wilmot and one department of the Government, as to his mode of going on this mission, was, we believe, the sole cause of his not then visiting Abomey. Captain Wilmot has replaced Commodore Elphinstone in command on that portion of the West Coast of Africa, and we hope to be able to announce that he will now visit the King of Dahomey the desired opportunity of seeing a "real Englishman, and talking over matters with him."—Ed. A. T.
* **DAHOMEY**: I am glad to inform you that Commodore Wilmott arrived off this town a week ago, and sent to communicate his desire to pay a visit to the King at Abomey. This message was forwarded without delay to his Majesty, and we are now expecting every hour to receive the King's invitation to the Commodore to come up to his capital. I do most sincerely hope that this visit may bring about some good.

You must remember that the King has a great prejudice against the officers of Her Britannic Majesty's ships of war for what he considers their want of forbearance with the slowness of African routine and their want of attention to time.* But the Commodore appears to be a man who has had considerable experience on this part of the coast, and I believe that he is quite prepared to forbear, and to talk patiently with the King.

The customs of Dahomey having finished for the present, the King has been living at Kannah, where he has been diligently exercising his troops, especially in firing. Their target is a goat, at which they fire with ball at various distances. When these exercises are finished, he will return to Abomey and have some new customs made before he goes with his army upon a war expedition.

I presume that he will receive Commodore Wilmott at Abomey. It is much to be regretted that the Commodore was not aware of the King's desire that he should be accompanied by Mr. Freeman.

I can now give you the correct number of slaves that were embarked on board the steam slaver between Ahwary and Grand Popo, at the end of last month. There were 1,025 put on board. It is believed here that the steamer—having got clear off without impediment—cannot fail to arrive safely with her horrid cargo at Cuba.

I have received yours of the 23rd October, &c., &c. Pray accept my sincere thanks for the great discretion you have exercised in dealing with my communications.
* **DAHOMEY**: The King arrived here from his war expedition toward Abeokuta, about three weeks since. A day or two ago he sent down his messengers, usually sent on such occasions, to summon or invite all here to a Custom at Kanna, now about to be held.

Mr. William Craft, from England, *via* Lagos, arrived here on the night of the 25th. He is invited up to Kanna. Mr. Bernasco is to go with him, as introducer, interpreter, &c. His presents, intended for the King, have all been opened here by the Dahoman Governor—repacked—and sent off up the country. Mr. Craft will find them there on his arrival, and will then have to arrange them for presentation to his Majesty.

I have had a good deal of talk with Messrs. Craft and Bernasco since the former arrived. He has been very well received everywhere on his way. He went from Lagos to Badagry in a canoe, on the 16th April. He describes the Lagoon between the sea and Badagry as having tens of thousands of palm trees (oil) about it. Two Dahoman King's messengers were there, and took Mr. Craft under their protection, as is customary when a stranger arrives anywhere in the country seeking the King. On the 18th he left Badagry in canoe for Porto Novo. There he was received by the King, who expressed great friendship for him. The King told him he had given over his country to the French. He offered, however, to send a messenger up to Abomey with him; *but the French authorities did not approve of this, and would not allow it.*

On the 21st he left Porto Novo in a large canoe for Godomey, which is in Dahomey proper, and about eighteen miles from Whydah. The entrance to the creek is very narrow, he says, and the creek itself not more than five or six feet wide—very crooked—shallow—and overhung with thick jungle. No stranger, he thinks, could find the entrance. But when within six or eight
**[JUNE 23, 1863.]**

miles of Godomey, the Lagoon is as much as, eight or ten miles wide. When Mr. Craft reached Godomey intelligence was forwarded to this place, and the Governor sent off seven men with hammock, &c., to bring Mr. Craft on here, where he arrived in the middle of the night of the 25th inst., taking up his quarters with Mr. Bernasco, who lives in the English fort.

The Governor has been very civil to him, as is customary with persons who come with gifts in their hands. I believe he has expressed to him a strong desire that he would come and settle here and engage in trade. He told him that the King would be very glad to see him. He will leave to morrow for Kanna.

I do not intend to go up to the Custom. You do not need any further description of the scenes enacted on such occasions. I hope that Commodore Wilmott, if he comes back again, will do as the French priests—Jesuits—did when the King asked them up—viz., make it a point that there shall not be any people put to death while he is present.
* **THE GOLD COAST.**: 

**Whydah.** They promised to grant us this as soon as we were ready to depart. On the night of the 27th inst. Prince Gbo, who succeeded the King during his absence, called upon me where I put up. We sat in long conversation, and I seized an opportunity to direct it to the subject of religion, and asked him whether he would not like to have the Gospel preached in his country. Poor man! he could not understand what I meant by the terms "preaching the Gospel," but after a little explanation he seemed to like it, but confessed that nothing of the kind could be allowed to be introduced into his country without the sanction of the King of Dahomey. On Monday morning, the 28th inst., having procured carriers, we left for the next station, about eight to twelve miles from Godome, where we hoped to procure a canoe for Whydah. Along the way from Godome to the wharf is occupied by an extensive course of water about three or four feet deep, and no stranger can get through without going by hammock. Accordingly I procured one, to be carried by four men. Leaving Godome at seven, we went through, and whilst two men bore the hammock upon their shoulders, the other two had to raise me up by the shoulders and waist, so as to prevent my being dragged along through the water: this occupies a course of about five to six miles' distance. As there are many custom-houses by the way, to whose officers we were bound to pay tribute, my guide told me that we should endeavour to secure Prince Gbo's staff, as he is the senior officer of the customs, excepting those in the Whydah station; by this means we should pass along unmolested. I accordingly availed myself of the opportunity of securing this. It is three feet long, the head is carved exactly like a man's right hand held or stretched out. If a man hold out his right hand with his fingers stretched out he sees the staff to which I am alluding. I got to the next station early, about 9.30, for my carriers moved as fast as they could, and then waited for the rest of the carriers, who got to the station about eleven o'clock. My guide then delivered the staff to the officer of this station—a wild and hungry-looking fellow of about fifty years of age. This man became angry on seeing this staff, because it prevented him from perpetrating his intentions. Notwithstanding this, he insisted upon the opening of my boxes. My guide, who is one of them, and knows their uncivil behaviour, told me to open them. I refused, alluding to the staff for my security. He then went and ransacked my guide's boxes and other luggage, deprived him of all his provisions, &c., seized and took away five of my mats which were to have covered me in the canoe, and told my guide to tell me I must pay something. I was obliged to make him a present of some money, besides the things he had seized, ere I was permitted to proceed. Having secured a canoe and men, we left this station for Whydah at 12.30. This is one of the principal stations of the King of Dahomey, in which a Wesleyan Society had flourished for some time. We had a pleasant voyage all along; but at length our canoe unfortunately ran upon a stump and narrowly escaped being capsized. On the morning of the 29th inst. I engaged a man to take me upon his shoulders, and had to walk about two hours in water three or four feet deep along the way to Whydah. As this is a chief station, we of necessity called here and obtained permission, else we would not be permitted to proceed. After visiting several persons in the place, and viewing other parts of the country, in which I noticed its populated state, the prosperity of trade, the beauty of the country itself, as well as its fine buildings, I thought what a sad thing indeed it is that a country possessed of such resources has not a single church or chapel to adorn or complete its beauty! As my guide told me we should get to my station the next day, or the third day at the longest time, and being resolved to proceed to Aguay that evening, I asked him to proceed with me to the palace of Prince Dinadu, and obtained permission to go away and get to my station in time. Accordingly we proceeded. But a minute or two before we left, Mr. Buko, our landlord, mentioned that he heard it noised abroad that the English Government were sending men as spies to Whydah. I told him I had heard nothing of the kind. Before this time it appears a similar report had gone forth informing the Prince that there are spies in the land; and, as we were bound to see him before we left, he was prepared also to meet us. Our landlord accompanied us to the palace of the Prince, who seemed to be exceedingly angry at our presence, and manifested a feeling totally unfriendly at the onset. Mr. Buko, our spokesman, knelt down, clapped his hands together several times, told him our mission, and besought him to grant us permission to pass to Little Popo, where we expect to begin our work. He inquired of me, through the interpreter, "Why did not the Wesleyan Missionary Society build the chapel there before sending men to take possession of it?" I said to my guide that there had been a chapel not only there, but even in Whydah, as well as Augway, &c., but these had been broken up. But for the good of the people and the instruction of the children this Mission wishes to renew these societies, and for this cause they sent me. On hearing this he was exasperated, and ordered us to return immediately by the way we came, and inform him by whom we were sent, that we have no permission or authority to proceed thither. All along from Dahomey beyond Popo is under the King's jurisdiction. Our Superintendent must write a letter of inquiry to the King of Dahomey and the princes or chiefs about his kingdom, so that due consideration might be given to the subject. As I had suffered a little from ill health shortly before I undertook my journey this way, I pleaded to obtain permission to have my course through Popo, not far from Whydah, so that I might return by the mail packet to Lagos, as the way through which I came to Whydah is rather tedious. Here he said he would not hear from me a word more, but I should return immediately by the way I came. He then called out, and a wild-looking gentleman presented himself, knelt down before him, and clapped his hands together several times. Upon his person we observed scores of keys suspended about his neck and waist. This he did to frighten me away. This individual I conjecture to be the keeper of the doors of the prison. On seeing this I became thoroughly convinced and satisfied that evil was determined upon, and that danger was at hand if I persisted. I beckoned to my guide and landlord, the latter kneeling and clapping his hands several times: we then bowed and retired from the palace. On returning to our landlord's house, we found him much troubled about this matter. We had thought at first to pass the night in Whydah, as the day was far gone; but having now found that we were becoming obstacles in the way of our landlord, we thought it most prudent to retire. There are scores of towns and villages situated on either side of the river which I saw on my way to Whydah. Also from Lagos up to Porto Novo we find scores of towns and villages on either side of the river. — *Wesleyan Magazine.*

* **DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.**: The King of Dahomey has not realized the expectations we last month hazarded respecting him. Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that "he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey." This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of "Man-slayer." There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the "Customs," inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the

* **The Adventures of S. Tubman, a Liberian, who has Escaped from Slavery in Dahomey**: 

At Abeokuta, on Sunday, the 11th April, 1875, during Divine service, at 10.30 a.m., several of us went out of the Church to meet the Dahomians, having heard of their approaching to the outside wall. As we went out we saw the Dahomians coming towards us, and went to meet them, not knowing that some Dahomians had already placed themselves in ambush. We halted, fired, and then wheeled round, and ran to save our lives. Those in ambush in our rear now came out and fired at us. Some had guns and others matchets and club sticks. I got to within about twenty yards of the gate when one of the Dahomians struck me violently on the back with his club and I fell down on my face to the ground. I was taken up, tied with rope, and taken to the camp; was in the Dahomian camp for about five days, and then sent under Dahomian escort, with about 800 egbas (men and women), that were caught and taken captives about the farms to Abomey; two old soldiers (pensioners) were amongst the lot. We were eleven days on the way from Abeokuta to Abomey, the capital of Dahomey. Several captives who were wounded, including one of the old soldiers, died on the way, and were thrown into the bush like beasts. We were fed with either roast corn or casada, taken from the farms by the Dahomians. We were all tied severally with ropes: at times we ate food once a day, at other times twice. On arrival at Abomey we were all put in chains—by the neck—remained in sitting posture; fed with either agidi, casida, or farina, with ground pepper and salt. We were locked up in a large compound. About fifteen days after our reaching Abomey, the king arrived with his army and some more captives. We were all taken out and brought before responsible chiefs. A fetish priest brought some fetish water in a pot mixed with some ingredient, and gave us each to drink. Those who leant back after drinking one or two glasses of this mixture are put by to be killed; those who sit upright are saved, and destined to be sold into slavery. About 300 leant back and were killed by the king's executioner, at the rate of fifty per day. I saw it all; I was among the saved ones. About a month afterwards I was sold with others to a chief called Wenu, of Arada, a village of about half an hour's journey from Abomey; he bought me for forty bags of cornes, 25f. Although I was born in Liberia and speak and write English, I was very careful not to let them know it, otherwise the king would not have sold me, nor would I afterwards be able to run away. My new master placed me to work in the farm planting yams, corn, casada, etc., and at times sent me in company of other slaves to Whydah to fetch rolls, tobacco, goods, cowries, and rum. When the English Commodore's ship came to Whydah, in February last, to see about some matters, was sent to fetch goods, and I saw some of the officers on shore. I managed to speak to one of the naval officers, recounting my trouble, and he said if I could manage to get on board one of the men-of-war ships, all right; but it was difficult, as the Dahomian authorities at Whydah are very particular with slaves. On the 15th May I was sent again to Whydah, in company of sixty slaves, to fetch goods. We reached Whydah on Wednesday, about 7 o'clock p.m. I told the chief I was going to the yard, where we lodge for the night, and I took occasion to go down the beach unperceived by any one; and by the sea shore I passed all the Custom offices in the different stations; the officials were all asleep. I travelled all night and reached Godomey at 4 o'clock a.m. I went and hid myself in the bush, as it was unsafe for a runaway slave to travel by day. On Thursday evening, at about 7 o'clock, I came out of the bush, and proceeded on my way to Kotonu. I arrived there at midnight. I went in to some of the Cape Palmas Kis-boys, in the employ of Regis Aine's house, and as I could talk the Kiss language, they took me in and hid me in their room. In the afternoon of Friday some canoes arrived from Porto Novo with produce. On returning I succeeded, through the Kissboyso in making arrangement with the Causenien, and I came away with them on Saturday night, and arrived in Porto Novo about 4 o'clock on Sunday morning. I lodged at the house of Senor Bambera. On Monday, the 22nd instant, I saw the steamer Renner in the river, and I went off to the owner on board and told him my trouble. He kindly gave me a free passage to Lagos. We left Porto Novo on Wednesday night, and reached Lagos on Thursday, the 25th instant. Seeing Lagos once more, I thank God for His mercies and safe deliverance. Whilst at Arada the king, who left home with his army in January last, on their usual expedition to Abeokuta and other places, sent home some slaves that he had recently captured from a village. Elated with this he went to Meks; he drove the people into the town; but, mustering efforts, the Meks people drove him out with great loss. About the fines imposed by the Commodore, the king sent to tell the chiefs at home that he will not pay; that he bought nothing from the English Government; but, as for his debt he owed some of the merchants he will pay them; that if the English wanted to fight him, the Commodore must send him notice beforehand, and not take him by surprise. On that account he sent orders and many fetish were made and sacrifices offered to them. A small wooden vessel was made to represent an English ship of war; they bore it fore and aft and, passing chains through it, suspended it, and decorated it with flags, blue, while, and red, put small anchor to it, as well as fetish—the vessel rested on a platform built of mud;—this implied that if the English men-of-war came to fight them the ships would be unable to move, and the Dahomian army will easily get them on the beach, and haul them up on shore. I saw human sacrifices offered to three idols or gods: one is in a house built with human blood and mud, and decorated with the skulls; another built with human blood, mud, and different kinds of beads; and the third built of different pattern of cloth in wooden frame. Before the king left home in January last on his expedition, several hundreds of the captives were killed and offered as sacrifices, several sent to be sold to the westward countries. I saw several slaves for mere trifling things done were tied up and flogged severely, till blood flowed from the body; others are beaten with club-sticks. I was flogged twice, and the marks on my person are evidence. I was nearly dead, and I resolved to escape by the first opportunity. I hope the day will soon come when Dahomey will be taken by England, or at least be made to feel its power.
* **The Adventures of S. Tubman, a Liberian, who has Escaped from Slavery in Dahomey**: 

At Abeokuta, on Sunday, the 11th April, 1875, during Divine service, at 10.30 a.m., several of us went out of the Church to meet the Dahomians, having heard of their approaching to the outside wall. As we went out we saw the Dahomians coming towards us, and went to meet them, not knowing that some Dahomians had already placed themselves in ambush. We halted, fired, and then wheeled round, and ran to save our lives. Those in ambush in our rear now came out and fired at us. Some had guns and others matchets and club sticks. I got to within about twenty yards of the gate when one of the Dahomians struck me violently on the back with his club and I fell down on my face to the ground. I was taken up, tied with rope, and taken to the camp; was in the Dahomian camp for about five days, and then sent under Dahomian escort, with about 800 egbas (men and women), that were caught and taken captives about the farms to Abomey; two old soldiers (pensioners) were amongst the lot. We were eleven days on the way from Abeokuta to Abomey, the capital of Dahomey. Several captives who were wounded, including one of the old soldiers, died on the way, and were thrown into the bush like beasts. We were fed with either roast corn or casada, taken from the farms by the Dahomians. We were all tied severally with ropes: at times we ate food once a day, at other times twice. On arrival at Abomey we were all put in chains—by the neck—remained in sitting posture; fed with either agidi, casida, or farina, with ground pepper and salt. We were locked up in a large compound.

* **Serious Troubles at Porto Novo**: Recent news from Lagos, *via* Paris, reports that Porto Novo, which is under French protection, is in a state of consternation, and the European traders are clamouring to be protected. That region has been suddenly invaded and harried by the King of Dahomey. The invading army is reported as numbering about ten thousand men, including the Amazon corps, which led the attacks. They fired ten important villages and some trading stations, killing all the elderly people, and carrying away all the able-bodied and children. This incursion is ascribed to a religious motive. The Amazons have depopulated the districts bordering on that of Porto Novo to appease the hunger of the evil spirits, who, the priests teach them, feed in some mysterious manner on those sacrificed to them. They have therefore, in their dread of their maleficent divinities, been emboldened to invade a territory which, being under French protection and enjoying an immunity from the sacrificial tax, is thickly populated. Sometimes as many as eight hundred human beings are offered up at Dahomey as a hecatomb. The most robust female children taken prisoners of war are reserved for the Amazonian corps, which now amounts to 4,000. They are entirely consecrated to martial purposes, and obliged under capital penalty to remain vestals. A gallant who causes an Amazon to forget her duties is smeared with honey and tied to a tree to be devoured by insects. These female warriors are more ferocious than their military brethren. They often sacrifice to Bacchus. Their King is nearly always drunk.

## British intervention in Dahomey was justified by framing its cultural practices, such as human sacrifice, as barbaric and destabilizing, which allowed the British to rationalize their efforts to dismantle Dahomey's power and influence under the guise of moral and civilizing missions.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that British intervention in Dahomey was justified by framing its cultural practices, such as human sacrifice, as barbaric and destabilizing. The General History of Africa does not explicitly mention this justification, instead highlighting British tactics like "divide and conquer" and exploiting African rivalries to their advantage. It emphasizes British interests in abolishing the slave trade and establishing legitimate trade, leading to treaties and the erosion of local sovereignty. While Dahomey's involvement in the slave trade and its transition to palm oil trade under French influence are noted, the textbook does not specifically link British intervention to cultural practices like human sacrifice. In contrast, The African Times articles align more closely with the claim, detailing Dahomeyan customs involving human sacrifices and portraying the King of Dahomey as a ruler who delights in such practices. The articles emphasize British abhorrence of these customs and frame intervention as a moral and civilizing mission, suggesting that exposing Dahomeyan envoys to "advanced civilization" could be beneficial. However, they also mention a treaty allowing British subjects to reside and trade in Dahomey, indicating economic interests alongside moral justifications. The articles further highlight Dahomey's strategic importance in trade routes and regional stability, suggesting that British intervention was motivated by a combination of moral, economic, and geopolitical interests. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that both supports and complicates the claim, revealing a complex interplay of motivations behind British actions in Dahomey.

* **Models of African initiatives and reactions**: War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals. They also provided pretexts for British interference in African affairs through offers of 'liberation' and 'protection' to the underdogs, 'alliances' with less powerful kingdoms, and invasion of the militaristic ones. The British employed a deliberate tactic of 'divide and conquer'. As a result, they exploited African rivalries, fears and weaknesses to their fullest advantage.
* **The growth of European interest**: Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts. European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.
Unfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port. Further west, suspicion of British political intentions grew in 1851 when Lagos was bombarded by the anti-slave trade squadron.
* **The collapse of Old Oyó**: Thus began the series of systematic invasions of Yorubaland by Dahomey. Motivated by considerations of state security and by the insatiable demand for slaves for export, for labour for both cash crop and subsistence agri› culture for the state and for the purpose of human sacrifice at the wellknown annual customs, the invasion affected not only the Yoruba west of the Ogun river. Equally affected were the Aja and Manhi communities and states east of the Werne river, including Porto Novo. 25 While the invasion of the Mahi immediately north of Agbome and of Porto Novo in the south-east was carried out in the 1820s, in the 1830s the concentration was on such Egbado towns as Ijanna and Refurefu, which were razed to the ground in 1831 and 1836 respectively. Ijanna, as noted above, was the residence of the Oyo imperial agent and the main centre for collecting and forwarding tributes from the Egbado and neighbouring area. In the 1840s and again in the 1880s, Okeodan and Sabe were ravaged. Also in the latter decade, the kingdom of Ketu, which began to be harassed in the late 1870s, was finally destroyed in 1886, four years after Imeko, the one other major town within the kingdom, had been burnt down.
* **Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Southern Nigeria**: While the Yoruba, by and large, chose the strategy of submission, the rulers of the kingdom of Benin and some of the rulers of the states of the Niger Delta chose that of confrontation. Though Benin had signed a treaty of protection with the British in 1892, she none the less guarded her sovereignty with determination. This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies. The other Delta states - Old Calabar, New Calabar, Brass and Bonny - stunned by this treatment of one of the most powerful and wealthy rulers of the Delta states and divided internally, surrendered and accepted governing councils imposed on them by Johnston.
* **The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14**: British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.
The missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population.
* **Purposes and impositions of colonialism**: Beyond the official rhetoric, the mundane purposes of colonization turned out to be quite limited. In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.
The introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.
However, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo.
* ****: A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination. What was true in 1976 can be seen as having been even more commonplace in that more dramatic period of external domina› tion in Africa, when an entire people, its social organizations, and its economic and artistic patterns became subjugated to strategies for maximum exploitation by outside interests. The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word. The Arabic dimension was unique in its own right, an ambivalent face of expansionism which none the less left strong cultural impressions on the landscape. Yet the reality that we extract from that period is the resilience and even increased vitality of the forms and values of the authentic cultures of the peoples.
* **The structure of Volume VII**: It will be seen from these chapters that the view that Africans received the invading soldiers with elation and quickly accepted colonial rule is not borne out by the available evidence. In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.
John D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.
Nevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast.
* **The Niger delta > The eastern delta**: In addition to the British consuls and naval officers on the coast, British traders and missionaries tried to get into the hinterland, for example, by sponsoring voyages of exploration. Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.
In the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century. Dike considered that Christianity turned the slaves into revolutionaries who created upheavals in these states; but recent research has discovered other social and political factors to explain the problems of the delta states in the nineteenth century. 7
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: Not all the West African Westernized authors at the time were prepared to see the Muslim cultural challenge as necessarily opposed to the true genius of the African or indeed as incompatible with the Christian values then feverishly expanding through missionary stations set up by black converts along the Niger, the Volta and the Senegal. For sociologists and educationists like the AbbØ Boillat (or his gallant compatriot, the scholarsoldier Paul Holle), Arabic language and Islamic culture deserved study preferably in higher institutions in France where they would leave no contaminating influence on impressionable Africans. Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther of Nigeria went further and was prepared to have them studied and taught.$^{38}$ It might even lead, through the translation of the Bible and catechism into Arabic, to an amelioration of the 'grosser aspects' of Islamic beliefs and society.
* **Islam and colonial rule**: try to cope with Islam and established institutes to study and document Muslim life, beliefs, practices and institutions. 22 Colonial powers were determined to break up large Muslim states and religious organizations and to foster rivalry and competition among them. Thus the British abolished the Sokoto caliphate in Northern Nigeria while the French openly encouraged the ethnic and dynastic rivalries which led to the disintegration of the Tukulor empire (see Fig. 6.2) and the proliferation of Sufi orders, and refused to recognize one Khalifa for all Muslim members of the Tijaniyya order in West Africa.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: In the west, the predominantly Catholic and lusophone Brazilian Africans initially found a more congenial cultural environment in Porto Novo and Whydah, where they had been preceded by an older 'Brazilian' community founded by Brazilian Portuguese slavers who had to withdraw entirely to the Aja coast in consequence of the British anti-slave trade naval action further east. The eventual substitution of French for Portuguese control of the area of the Gulf of Benin west of the Werne still left a residue of Latin culture sufficient to make Brazilians prefer this to the eastern coast, where Latin cultural influence was destined for eventual extinction. Consequently, it was in the area that eventually became French Dahomey that is the western parts of the region under discussion - that Brazilian Africans made their greatest impact. Not only did they co-operate with the French in the latter's successful bid to conquer Dahomey and create their new colony: Brazilians also ranked first and foremost in the colony in taking full advantage of French colonial education, thus making them a crucial factor in the growth of Dahomey as the 'Quartier Latin of French West Africa'. 45 However, this dichotomy in the locational focus of the impact of Saros and Brazilians must not be interpreted as contradictory to the overall development of the Mono-Niger region as an integral whole. Strong feelings of community based on specific kinship ties and general historical and cultural affinities among descendants of the da Silvas, the d'Almeidas, the Dos Regos, the de Souzas, the Pedros, the Martins, the Pereiras and so on, whether in Lagos, Whydah, Agwe or Porto Novo, warn against such interpretations. Indeed, the continuous recognition to this day of the relationship between West African Brazilian families and their original Brazilian bases, particularly those in the state of Bahia, makes the Brazilian connection an illustrious example of the essential unity not only of the history of Africa but also of the vital communication between the continent and the black diaspora.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities**: Finally, on the frontier with Borno, whose western territories had become the embryo emirates of Hadejia, Katagum, Missau and Gombe, the initial failure to reach a compromise (in the celebrated correspondence between Muhammad Bello and Shaykh al-Kanºmi during the djihäd) set the tone for the rest of the century. Mediation was rejected during the three years of Borno invasions into eastern Kano between 1824 and 1826, and no formal, public peace was made between the two states. Organized hostilities simply lapsed, without diplomacy or a decisive victory. In consequence no 'gifts', the crucial symbol of international relations, passed in either direction.
More successful was the mixture of diplomacy and force that resulted in truces (for example with Kebbi: the Lafiyar Togo 1866-74)$^{ or}$ treaties with smaller neighbouring communities to which the caliphate offered protection (amana) in return for a tax. In some areas the tax, assessed collectively, stipulated captives as well as goods such as mats, and so was similar to the contributions of some emirates. But we do not know how the rate per head differed from the rate of tax on Muslims within the caliphate.
* **Stages of resistance > The failure of African initiatives and resistance**: and Islam lays down strict rules for people's wars. Contrary to the idea common in the West, the djihâd as understood in recent centuries is defensive: that is, military service and the taxes that flow from it are only compulsory for everyone if the country is the victim of aggression. In the case of an offensive war (and there have been none in North Africa for centuries), contribu› tions and service are only voluntary. In the circumstances of the nineteenth century, this left the military initiative to the invader. Defence of the realm was traditionally one of the provisions of the bay'a (sovereign's investiture contract). In the event of attack, were Muslims supposed to organize resistance themselves immediately, or ought they to await the sultan's instructions? The question has been discussed at length by the doctors of law, and the view that prevailed was that responsibility should be left to the sovereign so as to stop demagogy and extravagant promises. This explains why, when French or Spanish soldiers appeared in a district, as they did in Tuât in 1864 and 1890 or Tarfaya in 1885, the inhabitants sent a delegation to the Sultan and then awaited his orders. Responsibility was thus left with the sovereign; and he was in a dilemma, for if he held aloof, he jeopardized the legitimacy of his authority, and if he replied favourably to the request, the powers would hold him responsible for anything that happened. Usually he advised calm, delegated a chief to maintain order, and allowed those involved to hope that the problem was being solved through diplomatic means (which many of those on the spot were all too ready to believe).$^{40}$ Here we come to the heart of the matter. When the Sultan failed,$^{41}$ and a religious or lay leader felt obliged to take up the banner of the djihäd in his stead but without his blessing, he would certainly not get unanimous support. The colonial powers could then play on all kinds of rivalries and hostilities.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance. In some cases, the Dyula community became thoroughly assimilated into the local community. Such instances of total assimilation were rare, but I. Wilks, in his informative study,$^{36}$ points to one example - the Tagara of Jirapa in north-western Ghana. The process was insidious enough. As already discussed in the case of the funeral rites of the Koumina canton, the Africans retained their custodianship of land, both physically and ritualistically, so that while, in the towns, contacts with the French and Islamic 'civilizing' missions, demonstrated undeniable advantage for the converts, the seasonal 'commuting' between land and city itself displaced 'unsecured' groups and individuals. Such was the fate of the Dyula.
* ****: However, as Professor Adu Boahen has correctly pointed out, it is a distortion of African history to see it in terms of heroes and villains. This approach fails to consider the prevailing circumstances under which various groups or individuals operated. The options available to them and their interpretations of these options may have been different from those imposed on them by politicians and scholars alike. It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time. Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.
In the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation. However, the vast majority of societies in this region did not have centralized governments. But lack of central governments does not imply lack of government, a mistake which some foreigners commenting on African societies have made in the past.
* **The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Kenya**: African response to all this was, as already indicated, both military and diplomatic, though at times there was withdrawal, non-co-operation or passivity. The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.
That the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force.
* **Somaliland > The Somali fight for freedom 1897-1914**: 1899. The British were so harassed by this that between the years 1900 and 1904 they sent four expeditions to repel alSayyid's attacks. Though the British were helped in these operations by the Italians, al-Sayyid's exceptional military skills and his successful use of cavalry and guerrilla tactics won his warriors a number of victories. One of these was at Gamburu hill in April 1903 in which nine British officers were killed.
* **Resistance to the imperial drive in the South, 1821-80**: altogether and to withdraw to the east coast in 1889. 39 Baker's attempts to secure the co-operation of the Africans were futile, as the tradition of resistance to foreigners was already deeply rooted in the southern Sudan. Immediately after his arrival at Gondokoro in 1874, Baker faced the open hostility of the Bari people and their chief, Alloron. They refused to sell him corn and destroyed that which his men cultivated. Though rivals of Alloron, the Beliman Bari and the Lokoya people joined in these operations.$^{40}$ The Moogie Bari killed twenty-eight soldiers, har› assed the caravans passing through their territory, and infected their neighbours in the west bank with this hostile attitude.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: It is a pleasure to the King of Dahomey to cut the heads off human beings, to show the strangers who visit him in the seasons of his annual customs, but especially to the English, or people connected with the English. His first reason is that the surrounding countries may fear him when they hear of it, so as to present themselves to him as his subjects; the second is that the English forbid his best trade, and that is in slaves; he will therefore kill everyone that he catches in war. Some of these poor victims of the Dahomian cutlass have to receive a good flogging, and from a sharp, cutting whip, while their necks are on the blocks ready for the cutlass. The cutting off their heads was not sufficient punishment for the crime of trying to defend themselves or to prevent their being kidnapped and sold for slavery. To say nothing of the number (upwards of 1,500) killed to be the attendants of the late King Gezo in the other world, with bullocks, rams, goats, cocks, drakes, and guinea fowls by the new King, in the great funeral custom of his late father, and who butchered the human beings just in the same way as he did the bullocks &c.—the blood of man and beasts mingled in one hole made on the ground at the gate of the palace—I shall only speak of what is going on now, and that of July and August last. I started from Whydah on the 4th of June, and reached Abomey on the 7th. On my arrival I missed several of the captains, and there were very few men in town. When I made inquiry I learnt that they were gone to attack some place. In about four days the King sent out about 1,600 men for another expedition. On the 15th those who went first returned to Abomey with 600 slaves, men, women, boys and girls, and forty heads of those who made resistance. I was called out to the King's gate to see the train. Each slave is followed by the one who caught him, holding the end of the string. How loud the sight cried for Christian England to help the weak against the mighty! The train comprised several grey-headed men and women. Some of them scarcely could walk. The sick among them were bound in cloth to poles, and carried. Their crime was that they did not come to the custom for his father, and they laughed at those who came from some towns behind them to present things to the King for the custom. The next day the slaves were delivered to the King; the very old ones were put aside to be killed, the young and the middle-aged were put aside to be sold.

Five days after this the second warriors returned with more than 200 slaves. Being disturbed in the counting, I did not get the correct number after the 200.

The slaves were brought to the King, as in the first case. As the captains passed before the King, they prayed him to hasten the time when Abbeokuta shall have no more name amongst the countries in the world.
* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In this custom he has to pass the furniture round the market, just the same as the other, and before doing the night previous must be evil night. The evil night carried away thirty-two. Two small trees were transplanted to the palace gate that night, and on each of these trees hung eight heads of the men killed in the night, as the fruits of the trees. Although this custom has nothing to do with a platform, he erected one; and on this he formed some stick-work, and laid a man on them, well fastened, and covered him with white baft, and saddled him; which was to imply that his late father rode on so high a white horse, that he saw everything in the world; that there was nothing hid from him. He also bound two men close to the poor fellow as his ostlers. All were left there until they were dead! He had three more evil nights, and on each occasion he had forty men killed. These poor fellows all fell victims under the Dahoman cutlass in the month of October. And does not the blood of these poor fellows cry to the Christian English to hasten themselves for the rescue of the weak and innocent from the mighty? As soon as the custom is entirely finished, the lion of the Bights will be up to seek more poor fellows for his cutlass, or for the slavers, to obtain money. I believe Christian England will embrace all chance to make an end of the slave-trade. The King of Dahomey throws all the fault upon those who bring vessels to purchase slaves in his country; he would sell none if no vessel came to purchase. What will Christian England do to stop this trade? Just about a month ago an American schooner left Whydah with upwards of 200 slaves, although the ships of war have been watching the schooner as closely as they possibly could.

Trusting to find you quite well, I am your obedient servant,
* **DAHOMAN ENVOYS TO ENGLAND**: We announced more than twelve months since that the King of Dahomey was very desirous to send some of his principal chiefs on a mission to this country. It seemed to us so advisable in the interests of African civilisation that he should be not only allowed, but encouraged and assisted to do so, that we have strenuously advocated the measure. In our May number we made some comments on a letter of the late Commodore on the West Coast station; in which, in pursuance, as we believed of orders from home, the King of Dahomey's request was refused. Our correspondence from Dahomey shows us, however, that the King has not accepted this reply of the Commodore as a final decision against him, but has applied directly by letter to Her Majesty's Government with the same object. In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey's wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King's wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious "Customs" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling "Customs" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty's abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of "Customs" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world's advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King's application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.
* **ABEOKUTA AND DAHOMEY**: The differences that have arisen between this mighty country of Great Britain and the weak and puny Dahomey, aggravated as they have been by the insensate insolence of King Gélélé in his reply to the demands of Commodore Sir William Hewett, are well worthy to occupy the attention of the authorities and people of Abeokuta. There is one point that we would impress strongly upon them. This is, that Great Britain will not recede from the demands made on the King of Dahomey by Commodore Hewett; and, consequently, that should the blockade of the Dahoman ports, which will commence on the 1st of July next, fail in its object of bringing the King to reason, and to a full compliance with the demands that have been made upon him, other and more effective means will most certainly be employed. What those means must necessarily be it is not at all difficult to imagine. The Power that directed the long and difficult march on the capital of Ashanti is not likely to shrink from the comparatively short and easy march on Abomey. It is, therefore, well that the authorities and people of Abeokuta should set themselves at once earnestly to consider what it will be their duty and their interest to do should it become necessary for Great Britain to adopt such extreme measures against their bitter and inveterate enemy. Dahomey has been and, unless its power be broken and destroyed, or it be restrained by engagements entered into with Great Britain, will continue to be, year by year, a ruinous curse to the Egba people. Year by year it has invaded their territory, cruelly butchered most of those whom it could surprise in the open villages and farms between the frontier of Dahomey and Abeokuta, and carried off the remainder of them for more protracted torture and more cruel death in the fearful "Customs" of Abomey. Every Egba heart that has in it a spark of love of country ought to beat high with hope of entire deliverance from the attacks of so cruel a foe, and with eagerness to assist in that work of retribution which has been too long delayed. Although the Egbas, not being themselves an organized military power, like Dahomey, have never been able of themselves, when they have turned back the tide of invasion from the walls of Abeokuta, to pursue their enemy into the Dahoman territory, they must certainly be quite as capable of supporting the fatigues of a march on Abomey, and of providing themselves with the necessary provisions for such a march, as ever the Dahomans were to support the fatigues and provide themselves with provisions for their marches on Abeokuta. It would be their duty and for their interests, therefore, to take part in any chastisement to be inflicted by Great Britain on Dahomey. To enable them to do this at the proper moment, they ought at once to decide upon what their expeditionary force shall be, and to arrange the necessary supply of provisions for it; so that should the moment for action arrive, they may be able to take advantage of that moment, and proceed without delay to the frontier of Dahomey—to those river fords over which the King and his Amazons have so often passed to burn their villages and farms, and slaughter and carry away captive, for a more fearful butchery during their "Customs," the laborious and unoffending Egbas. We imagine that there could be but one feeling in Abeokuta on this subject, and that is, a firm determination to show themselves worthy of their ancient fame, and to assist in putting an end at once and for ever to all possibility of any future invasions by Kings of Dahomey. As is the duty of the people of Abeokuta, such also is the duty of the Akus everywhere along the West Coast. Although they cannot go themselves to such a war, they can assist their brethren in Abeokuta in many important ways, which it ought not to be necessary for us to detail. There is only one further remark that we would make at present. Let it not enter into the heads of the authorities and people of Abeokuta, or of the Akus in the British Settlements, or elsewhere along the West Coast, that their co-operation in the way we have pointed out is at all indispensable to Great Britain. Great Britain *alone* is quite equal to the task of capturing and destroying a hundred Abomeys, if there were such, without assistance from, or the co-operation of, the Egbas, whether in or out of Abeokuta. We have merely pointed out to them what true honour and patriotism, and a correct appreciation of their own future interests, should counsel and impel them to do. We have done our duty in putting this plainly before them; we shall see how they will perform theirs should the occasion arise.
* **The Adventures of S. Tubman, a Liberian, who has Escaped from Slavery in Dahomey**: TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.

Lagos, West Africa, June 2, 1876.

Dear Sir,—I beg to forward you herewith for publication a letter that we received from a former servant of ours who had gone to Abeokuta, and an account he gave us of his troubles. He is a native of Liberia, born in 1850, and received some education there in the Grammar School, under Mr. Gibson. His mother is at present a nurse in the Orphan Asylum. In the late Grebo-Liberian war, a brother and cousin of his were killed in battle by the Grebos.

How true, alas! it is that "the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty." We hope one day Dahomey will be made to feel the power of England, as well as her mercy.

Yours faithfully,  
JOHN A. PAYNE.

LETTER OF GEORGE S. TUBMAN TO MR. AND MRS. J. A. PAYNE.

Lagos, May 28, 1876.

Dear Master and Mrs.,—I just come down from the Dahomey country, being caught there at or in the same year that Mr. Cole and others been killed in Abeokuta, and just come here on last Thursday in the S.S. Renner, and, being quite naked, I therefore ask you in the name of our Redeemer if you have any old clothes, please, Sir, to give me a few, as I am ashamed to come as I am. I know that I have done a great sin against you, but still you can forgive me for the same. I return now as the Prodigal Son, and say, I have sinned against heaven and thee. As I am naked and have no raiment to put on, that is the reason I am entreating for some from you, Sir, in the name of our Creator.—I am, your unworthy Servant just out of Slavery,  
GEORGE S. TUBMAN.

Mr. and Mrs. John A. Payne.

Narrative by S. Tubman, an Escaped Slave from Dahomey.
* **OPERATIONS AGAINST DAHOMEY.**: We purposely resisted the temptation to comment on the late news from the Coast, that Sir William Hewett had asked for 500 European troops, 1st West India Regiment, and 600 Houssas, for an invasion of Dahomey; but the frequent London Correspondent of the Standard in this matter of Dahomey, a former West Coast official, having indited a long letter on the subject, some brief remarks on our part seem to be necessary. We think this correspondent takes an exaggerated view of the fighting resources of Dahomey, of the mortal peril of the European detenus there, and of the reckless character of King Gelélé. Affect what he may, this wretched thing of a King will be too wise to cut himself off from all possibility of future reconciliation with Great Britain, which he would do by murdering the Europeans now within his power, as we presume a preliminary summons would be made, in which the King would be distinctly informed that in the event of his injuring those persons, he would open a gulf between himself and the British that could only be closed up by his own dead body. There are some observations, however, in the letter which are so much in keeping with views we have expressed with regard to the Ashanti War and the Dahoman one, should it take place, that we have pleasure in reproducing them. He says, most justly, "If, however, our troops do intend pushing on to Abomey and giving King Gelélé a lesson, we trust that a more effectual one will be administered than in the case of his neighbour of Ashanti. It will not be enough if we march through the town with colours flying, driving a frightened herd of women and children before us, and finally set fire to a few thatched mud huts, and then hurry back to the coast. Gelélé, should danger menace him, will, in all probability, take to the bush, and, if such should be the case, we ought not to retire until he has been dragged from his concealment, and brought face to face with the commander of the expedition." The only modification we should make in the above is that the lesson we should give to Gelélé should not stop at anything short of the breaking up of that Power which, so long as it continues to exist, will never cease to offer up its hecatombs of victims at the behest of the sanguinary superstitions which have made Dahomey so odious to all civilized peoples. The concluding remarks we, of course, endorse, since they are in favour of a policy that we have advocated from the first hour in which we heard of the new Gold Coast Colony being proclaimed: "Finally, we would again urge the necessity there exists of forming a continuous coast-line of British territory from the Assinee River to Lagos. Until this happy event becomes consummated, the traders of the West Coast will ever be subjected to the capricious treatment of petty kinglets, while our revenue will be defrauded by the smuggling, which such gaps render only too easy of performance." King Gelélé has offered to us an opportunity for realizing this, and it would be the very climax of folly not to avail ourselves of it to the fullest extent.
* **THE DAHOMEY TREATY**: If, as we believe no one will dispute, "half a loaf is better than no bread," we have at least some ground for satisfaction in the Treaty which was concluded on the 12th day of May last, at Whydah, between Her Majesty Queen Victoria and the King of Dahomey. We never concealed that it was our heart's intense desire that the difficulty which had arisen with Dahomey, owing to ill-treatment of Mr. Turnbull at Whydah, might lead to the entire destruction of that horrible rule under which the neighbouring countries to Dahomey are year by year invaded and devastated, with the supreme object of obtaining human victims for those perpetually recurring feasts of blood, the "Customs" held at Abomey. Our desires are not fulfilled, and we bow in submission to what we suppose to have been "the inevitable." We cannot have any doubt that Her Majesty's Government would most gladly have seconded our desires had circumstances at this time permitted the employment of the only means by which results so desirable could be obtained. Not feeling justified, at this period of European perturbation, in proceeding to those extremities to which King Gelélé seemed for some months to be forcing Her Majesty's Government by his insolent obstinacy, they have no doubt done wisely in instructing Commodore Sullivan to welcome the exhibition of better feeling on the part of King Gelélé, by agreeing to a reduction of the fine imposed by Commodore Hewett, on condition of certain stipulations for the better security in future of Her Majesty's subjects residing and trading in Dahomey. These stipulations are important. We gave the full text of the Treaty in our September number; and whatever loss and inconvenience may have been occasioned by the late blockade to the British merchants engaged in commerce there when that blockade was declared, we hope and believe they will be more than compensated by the stability and security guaranteed to their future operations by its provisions. The former position of British subjects and traders in Dahomey was entirely one of sufferance. They were in a country of barbarians, at their own risk and peril, without any treaty rights or guaranteed protection; subject to the fluctuating caprices of uncivilized despotism, and quite uncertain to...
* **THE DAHOMEY TREATY**: 

to the degree of support, if any, they might receive in case of need from their own Government. All this is changed by the Treaty. British subjects have now a recognized station; they may visit, reside, and trade in Dahomey as of right; they are not to be annoyed, or inconvenienced, or impeded in their trade, either by the King of Dahomey, his subjects, or any foreigners within his dominions; and they may hire, occupy, and possess any houses or warehouses for the purposes of commerce. We do not underrate, nor do we think those engaged, or to be hereafter engaged, in commerce and trade with and in Dahomey will underrate the importance of these stipulations. We should have been glad, however, to see an additional one, which is unhappily absent, to the effect that no British subject, or his goods or produce, should be liable to any additional or increased payment or exaction over and above what may be demanded and taken from the subjects of any other foreign Power. The position and influence in Dahomey of the subjects of one other European Power—a position and influence dating from the time of the foreign slavetrade—rendered, we think, a "most favoured nation" clause as desirable in this treaty with Dahomey as in other treaties in which it has been from time to time inserted. The confirmation of pre-existing stipulations as regards the foreign slave-trade, was a matter of course. No British negotiations treating with such a State as Dahomey could possibly fail to reassert the determined opposition of Her Majesty's Government to any renewal of that odious traffic in human flesh, now, happily, almost extinct, so far as the West Coast of Africa is concerned; although during the last twelve months, and, unhappily, even in our last and this present number, we have had to expose desultory individual efforts, on the part, too, of British subjects, to revive and perpetuate it. But our most hearty thanks are due to Her Majesty's Government and to Commodore Sullivan for the stipulation in Article 6. Although unable, at present, to force the discontinuance of human sacrifices in Dahomey, it was well to place on record anew the British abhorrence of them, by demanding and obtaining for British subjects an exemption from those horrible commands which the King of Dahomey has been accustomed to make and enforce on Europeans at Whydah, that they should attend his abominable Customs, in which so many poor creatures are tortured and sacrificed, at the behests of a bloodthirsty superstition. Article 6 stipulates that "no British subject shall henceforth be compelled to attend any of the Customs of the country of Dahomey where any human sacrifices are held." This stipulation alone, even if the Treaty had not contained those other important ones on which we have commented, would have amply justified the remission of a portion of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett, and to enforce payment of which the Dahoman coast was blockaded. Such a stipulation is cheap at 100 puncheons of oil; and we are quite sure Her Majesty's Government would have abandoned all claim to the other 400 puncheons, and even made an annual payment out of the Imperial Exchequer in addition, if King Gélélé would have undertaken, in consideration thereof, to abolish those human sacrifices which cause every humane mind to think of Dahomey with disgust and loathing. Article 6, however, is an insertion of the "thin end of the wedge" as regards that ruinous waste of human life, which makes Dahomey a curse, as well as an abomination, to her less bloodthirsty neighbours, and is tending rapidly to her own impoverishment, depopulation, and ruin.
* **FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.**: Among the passengers on board the mail steamer Lagos, which arrived at Liverpool from the West Coast of Africa early in November, are the Dahomeyan envoys, sent by King Behanzin to confer with the French Government, with a view to peace. The party includes the king's great chiefs, Chedingar and Ayumkuken; his messenger, Tassah; Mr. Henry Dasos, an interpreter, and Mr. John P. Jackson, editor of *The Lagos Record*. The chiefs stoutly deny that the King of Dahomey is the inhuman monster he has been represented to be. They affirm that no human sacrifices are offered in Dahomey, except at the annual "Royal custom," which, however, has been suspended for the past four years. At this custom all the royal maidens are required to fetch water from the sacred streams of Golutar. This water is sprinkled in the royal mausoleum, after which sacrifices of sheep and oxen are made by the fetish priest, followed by a human sacrifice, the victim being commissioned to convey messages to the spirits of the deceased kings, and to invoke their guidance and protection for the throne and kingdom. The chiefs, in support of the foregoing, assert that of the 4,000 Yorubas captured in the last raid at Abeokuta four years ago, not one has been offered in sacrifice, and that it is a capital offence to shed human blood in Dahomey, and also that any chief or prince who would cause one of his servants to be beaten so that he fainted would be imprisoned for life. The chiefs were well pleased with the treatment and comfort they received on the voyage to England, and what they saw in the Liverpool streets and docks caused them great surprise.

These envoys took 21 days to get from Dahomey to Lagos on account of their adopting a circuitous route in order to avoid the French troops who are now operating in Dahomey. The Chief Chedingar takes to France the staff of King Behanzin, which is entirely made of silver, and represents the head of the sacred shark of Dahomey. This is the first time that this staff has ever left the country, and this is also the first occasion on which Dahomeyans have left Africa to treat with a civilised nation.

The envoys are represented to have declared that the King maintains that General Dodds deceived him, and he was

## The British sought to neutralize the perceived threat of the Dahomey Kingdom to regional stability through diplomatic influence and military intervention, marking the beginning of European efforts to curb its aggressive actions.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that the British sought to neutralize the perceived threat of the Dahomey Kingdom through diplomatic influence and military intervention. The General History of Africa does not provide specific details supporting or refuting this claim, instead focusing on the broader context of Anglo-French rivalry and the strategic importance of trade and territorial control in the region. It highlights the French conquest of Dahomey in 1892 but does not attribute any specific British military or diplomatic efforts aimed at curbing Dahomey's aggressive actions, emphasizing instead the partition of territories and protectorate declarations. In contrast, The African Times articles offer several details supporting the claim, describing British diplomatic pressure through the imposition of a fine on the King of Dahomey for outrages against British and French subjects, and indicating a readiness for military intervention through the blockade of Dahoman ports and potential deployment of British troops, including the 1st West India Regiment and Houssas. The articles also mention the establishment of British protectorates and highlight the British naval presence and involvement of Commodore Sir William Hewett, underscoring the military aspect of British efforts. However, they do not explicitly state that these actions marked the beginning of European efforts to curb Dahomey's aggression, nor do they provide a comprehensive overview of European involvement beyond British actions. This lack of broader European context in the articles contrasts with the textbook's focus on Anglo-French rivalry, illustrating a notable difference in the portrayal of British and European strategies regarding Dahomey.

* **The growth of European interest**: Thus as early as the 1860s, at a time when the French and British governments were generally opposed to colonial acquisitions in Africa, the special circumstances of this particular African locality had already involved the two most active European nations in a struggle for territorial possession. The Anglo-French convention of August 1863 actually agreed on a partition of the area between the two powers, with the Yewa river, about 20 km west of what became the border in 1889, as the agreed boundary. The French and British declarations of protectorates in the area between 1862 and 1863 did not enjoy official ratification and had to be abandoned in the 1870s. But the struggle was resumed again in the 1880s, partly because of the entry of Germany into the race and partly because of renewed invasions by Dahomey which increased the determination of the rulers of Porto Novo and the states of western Yorubaland to seek protection from the French or the British. The French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, the AngloFrench Partition of Borgu in 1895, the extension of British rule over the rest of Yorubaland and their conquest of Benin in 1897 must be seen as the logical conclusion of the Anglo-French rivalry of the 1860s, itself provoked by the pre-existing unities of the hinterland of the ports the European powers tried to control on the coast.
* **The growth of European interest**: Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts. European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.
Unfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port. Further west, suspicion of British political intentions grew in 1851 when Lagos was bombarded by the anti-slave trade squadron.
* **The growth of European interest**: The events that marked the real turning point, however, were the formal annexation of Lagos to the British Crown in 1861 and a British naval action against Porto Novo later the same year.$^{34}$ These two British actions naturally sensitized the French, who had considerable commercial interests in Whydah and Porto Novo. Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.
* **Models of African initiatives and reactions**: War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals. They also provided pretexts for British interference in African affairs through offers of 'liberation' and 'protection' to the underdogs, 'alliances' with less powerful kingdoms, and invasion of the militaristic ones. The British employed a deliberate tactic of 'divide and conquer'. As a result, they exploited African rivalries, fears and weaknesses to their fullest advantage.
* **Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Southern Nigeria**: While the Yoruba, by and large, chose the strategy of submission, the rulers of the kingdom of Benin and some of the rulers of the states of the Niger Delta chose that of confrontation. Though Benin had signed a treaty of protection with the British in 1892, she none the less guarded her sovereignty with determination. This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies. The other Delta states - Old Calabar, New Calabar, Brass and Bonny - stunned by this treatment of one of the most powerful and wealthy rulers of the Delta states and divided internally, surrendered and accepted governing councils imposed on them by Johnston.
* **The legacy of wars**: As noted above, the critical factor in the changing balance of power in Africa in the 1870s was not the troops, nor their training and discipline or generalship, but the quality and quantity of the guns available to the respective sides. The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.
The truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected.
* **The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14**: British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.
The missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population.
* **The growth of European interest**: In discussing the growth of European interest in the area of West Africa under review, it is useful to distinguish between two phases: that of freedom of movement for the European powers involved up to 1861 when Lagos was annexed to the British Crown, and the succeeding era of international rivalry between France and Britain with Germany entering the competition in the 1880s. This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.
In the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.
Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.
* **The European offensive**: With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the European offensive, relying on forces that became increasingly irresistible, was launched in the Maghrib and soon afterwards throughout the rest of the world. Initially, market considerations were the most decisive factor. As production grew in the Maghrib to keep pace with the rate of industrialization in Europe, prices fell accordingly and the terms of trade deteriorated. Under the harsh economic conditions of the times, competition became progressively fiercer and European policies for expansion overseas became more aggressive. 15 As early as 1816, the British fleet under Lord Exmouth was despatched to North Africa and this was repeated in 1819 under Admiral Freemantle with the co-operation of the French naval division of Admiral Jurien, in order to notify the 'Barbary' powers of the ban that had been placed on privateering by a concerted decision of the European nations. This osten› sibly noble purpose, however, concealed rapacious intentions, since sub› stantial commercial privileges were demanded by the French, especially on behalf of their countrymen living in Provence, and by the British on behalf of their Italian and Spanish clients, who were in competition with the French. This marked the beginning of an ultimately highly successful policy aimed at securing the submission of the North African countries to Europe's ever-growing economic and political demands.$^{16}$ Instructions given to the new French consul who was sent to Tunis at the head of a squadron in 1824 stressed 'the necessity of establishing relations with this inferior power [the Regency] which are more in keeping with the dignity and interests of the kingdom [of France]'.$^{17}$ European, and particularly French trade, derived the greatest benefit from this 'necessity', since it was enabled to expand rapidly by exceptionally advantageous facilities provided by a system that was revoltingly unfair. Even the shadiest European deals were sure to succeed thanks to the influence of the relevant consul. 'If there were no Barbary pirates, they would have to be invented', exclaimed one of the French merchants established in Tunis.$^{18}$ Another factor that came into play was the sense of 'national honour', for various aspirations could be satisfied or failures compensated for with only a minimum of risk in the Maghrib. It is common knowledge that the Algiers expedition in 1830 was decided on by a declining regime, intent upon restoring its prestige and strengthening its positions within France
* **European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914 > Ethiopia**: the British who favoured Italian expansion in the hope of curbing that of France, their principal rival in the Scramble for Africa. The Italian officer in charge of the occupation, Rear-Admiral Caimi, proclaimed to the inhabitants that this action was taken in agreement with the British and Egyptians, and promised: 'No obstacle shall be put by me on your trade; on the contrary, all my exertions shall aim at facilitating it.'$^{41}$ This profession, however, rapidly proved worthless, for the Italians soon stopped the supply of arms to Yohannes, and penetrated inland as far as the villages of Sahati and Wia. Ras Alula protested against this infiltration, but the Italians replied by fortifying the disputed areas, and by sending more troops which were intercepted by Ras Alula at Dogali in January 1887. The invaders thereupon evacuated Sahati and Wia, but, complaining of a 'massacre' at Dogali, blockaded all shipping bringing supplies to Ethiopia. 42 War between the Italians and Yohannes seemed imminent, but the former, anxious to avoid a difficult mountainous campaign, persuaded Britain to mediate. A British diplomat, Sir Gerald Portal, was dispatched to the Emperor to ask him to agree to an Italian occupation of Sahati and Wia, and of the Senahit or Bogos area which the Egyptians had ceded in 1884. When these proposals were read out, Yohannes bluntly answered 'I can do nothing with all this. By the Treaty made by Admiral Hewett, all the country evacuated by the Egyptians on my frontier was ceded to me at the instigation of England, and now you come to ask me to give it up again.' Angered that Britain had thus departed from the treaty, he wrote to Queen Victoria, protesting that if she wished to make peace it should be when the Italians were in their country and the Ethiopians in theirs. 43 Yohannes, faced with the growing threat from Italy, strengthened his defences by moving up a garrison stationed on the Sudan frontier. Finding the area unguarded, the Mahdists attacked there. The emperor hastened to Matamma to resist them, but at the close of a victorious battle on 10 March 1889, was mortally wounded by a stray bullet. News of his death caused his army to disintegrate. There was great confusion throughout northern Ethiopia, the more so as
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble**: Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited. Both Germany and, especially, Britain were able to wield all the influence they wanted, and no statesmen in their right senses would have freely elected to incur the costs, and court the unforeseen contingencies of formal annexation when they could derive the same advantages from informal control. 'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.
But this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique. So far as the Portuguese and King Leopold were concerned, then, the Scramble was under way by 1876.
* **Increased European pressures**: As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control. Towards the end of this period, however, the rise of Germany as a major Western power was beginning to increase the competition that already existed. Outside the East African sphere, tensions caused by this competition were already beginning to appear. When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties. The British kept hoping that strengthening Seyyid Barghash's authority on the mainland would be enough to protect their interests without direct colonization.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa**: The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began. As European nations increasingly became interested in the acquisition of African territories, the missionaries paved the way in some areas of Africa and served, quite consciously, as agents for European colonialism. Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans. Missionaries therefore enthusiastically encouraged European intervention as a morally justified undertaking, especially from the 1870s onwards.
* **The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Uganda**: Probably the greatest diplomat of all those who had to deal with the advent of imperialism in East Africa in the last decade of the nineteenth century was Mwanga, the Kabaka of Buganda, which had been declared a British Protectorate in 1894. When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903.
* **Egypt > Egyptian initiatives and reaction to British conquest 1882-1914**: and wrote articles and pamphlets. ' $^{1}$ These activities aroused a great deal of interest in Europe, but that was as far as it went. KämiPs optimistic belief that Europe in general, and France in particular, would support the Egyptian cause was wholly unjustified. Since France had her own colonies in North Africa, it is not surprising that she was not won over by KämiPs arguments in favour of self-rule. Nor was she ready to go to war with England over Egypt, as the Fashoda incident had shown in 1898.
* **The unifying efforts of Emperor TØwodros II > Conflict with Britain**: Explaining that the Turks had prevented him sending an embassy he declared that he wished Queen Victoria to arrange for its 'safe passage'. 82 Consul Cameron, the British representative, forwarded this appeal to London, reporting that its author had asked him to procure engineers and doctors from England, and observed that there 'need be no fear of bad treatment' as the missionaries working for the monarch were 'very liberally' treated.$^{83}$ The two letters reached London in mid-February, but were not considered of importance. No reply was vouchsafed to the Emperor's, while Cameron's remained unanswered until late April when the British Foreign Secretary, Earl Russell, returned an unsympathetic response. 84 The British government, he later observed, felt that 'considering the short tenure of power of Abyssinian Kings' it was desirable 'to withdraw as much as possible from Abyssinian engagements, Abyssinian Alliances, and British interference in Abyssinia'. 85 As time passed and his letter remained unanswered TØwodros became impatient. He was irritated that the British government showed no interest in Ethiopia, the more so as he knew the French had supported the rebel NegusØ, and felt that his royal dignity had been slighted. Cameron made matters worse by visiting the Egyptian side of the Sudan border, and exchanging courtesies with officials there, thus giving the impression that he sided with an enemy then overrunning Ethiopia.$^{86}$ Russell's letter to Cameron confirmed the Emperor's fears, for it brusquely stated, 'it is not desirable for Her Majesty's Agents to meddle in the Affairs of Abyssinia', and that the consul should return to Massawa, and remain there 'until further notice'.$^{87}$ The British government, it seemed, was breaking off diplomatic relations with Ethiopia and transferring support to Egypt and the Turks in Massawa. Shortly afterwards TØwodros learnt that a mission› ary, Henry Stern, had published unfavourable remarks about him, among them the accusation that missionaries were tried and sentenced to con› finement. Not long afterwards, in November, Cameron's secretary, Kerens, arrived with a letter from Earl Russell's secretary, reminding the consul of his instructions to return to Massawa, and adding that he was only consul at the port, and had 'no Representative character in Abyssinia'. 88 TØwodros's anger was intensified by a gift which
* **Egypt > Egyptian initiatives and reaction to British conquest 1882-1914**: The Dinshäway incident of May 1906 profoundly boosted KämiPs campaign in Egypt. Briefly, a group of British officers came to Dinshäway village on a pigeon-shooting trip, which the villagers objected to since pigeons were their means of livelihood. A clash followed in which one of the British officers was fatally wounded. The British authorities over› reacted to this incident and passed very severe sentences on the villagers. Four were sentenced to be hanged and many others were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Although public executions had been stopped two years previously, the hangings were carried out in public, and the whole village of Dinshäway was forced to watch the executions. ·$^{3}$ This barbaric behaviour had, in Kämil's view, done more to awaken people's feelings against the occupation than the passage often years of occupation. ' 4 The incident certainly caused an upsurge of Egyptian nationalism and for the first time since 1882, the British became aware of the insecurity of their position in Egypt. It was this which forced the British to reconsider their oppressive policy and to declare their intention of preparing the country for self-government. Cromer retired in 1907 to make way for a new Consul-General, Eldon Gorst, to implement the new policy. This represented a great triumph for Kämil and his Nationalist Party, which was inaugurated publicly in 1907.
* **Towards an imperialist policy**: Tripolitania and Morocco succeeded in postponing a European occu› pation. The chief claimant as regards Tripoli was Italy, which had been watching the struggle for Tunisia anxiously in the years preceding 1881, but it was only at the beginning of the 1880s that it began pressing its claims.$^{20}$ In 1884-5,$^{ tne}$ Italian High Command prepared plans for war. However, owing to a lack of agreement among the imperialist powers, their execution had to be postponed.$^{21}$ For the same reason, Morocco was able to avoid foreign occupation until the end of the nineteenth century. However, its attempts to curtail the privileges and high-handedness of foreigners suffered a setback. At a conference of the European powers and the USA, held in Madrid in 1880, Moroccan sovereignty was once again subjected to restrictions and it was announced that no changes could be made in the administration of the country without the prior consent of the powers that attended the conference.
In the Muslim world, the carving up and occupation of the greater part of North Africa were regarded as a fresh outrage against Islam. The struggle of the North African fighters for the Faith met with support (in most cases moral support only) in Istanbul and in other countries of the East.$^{22}$ Relying on this support, new attempts were made in Algeria and Tunisia to arrest colonization by force of arms: these were the uprisings led by Bü Amäma in Algeria, in 1881, and by 'AIT bin Khalifa in Tunisia in 1881-3. Despite the tenacity and heroism displayed b~y~the rebels, these uprisings failed to attain their objective. In point of fact, they had already become rearguard actions, the last-ditch attempts of a traditional society to defend the avenues of its idiosyncratic development on the basis of ancient moral and social structures, already undermined during the foreign conquest and the development of colonial capitalism.
* ****: However, as Professor Adu Boahen has correctly pointed out, it is a distortion of African history to see it in terms of heroes and villains. This approach fails to consider the prevailing circumstances under which various groups or individuals operated. The options available to them and their interpretations of these options may have been different from those imposed on them by politicians and scholars alike. It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time. Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.
In the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation. However, the vast majority of societies in this region did not have centralized governments. But lack of central governments does not imply lack of government, a mistake which some foreigners commenting on African societies have made in the past.
* **Stages of resistance > The failure of African initiatives and resistance**: and Islam lays down strict rules for people's wars. Contrary to the idea common in the West, the djihâd as understood in recent centuries is defensive: that is, military service and the taxes that flow from it are only compulsory for everyone if the country is the victim of aggression. In the case of an offensive war (and there have been none in North Africa for centuries), contribu› tions and service are only voluntary. In the circumstances of the nineteenth century, this left the military initiative to the invader. Defence of the realm was traditionally one of the provisions of the bay'a (sovereign's investiture contract). In the event of attack, were Muslims supposed to organize resistance themselves immediately, or ought they to await the sultan's instructions? The question has been discussed at length by the doctors of law, and the view that prevailed was that responsibility should be left to the sovereign so as to stop demagogy and extravagant promises. This explains why, when French or Spanish soldiers appeared in a district, as they did in Tuât in 1864 and 1890 or Tarfaya in 1885, the inhabitants sent a delegation to the Sultan and then awaited his orders. Responsibility was thus left with the sovereign; and he was in a dilemma, for if he held aloof, he jeopardized the legitimacy of his authority, and if he replied favourably to the request, the powers would hold him responsible for anything that happened. Usually he advised calm, delegated a chief to maintain order, and allowed those involved to hope that the problem was being solved through diplomatic means (which many of those on the spot were all too ready to believe).$^{40}$ Here we come to the heart of the matter. When the Sultan failed,$^{41}$ and a religious or lay leader felt obliged to take up the banner of the djihäd in his stead but without his blessing, he would certainly not get unanimous support. The colonial powers could then play on all kinds of rivalries and hostilities.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: It is a pleasure to the King of Dahomey to cut the heads off human beings, to show the strangers who visit him in the seasons of his annual customs, but especially to the English, or people connected with the English. His first reason is that the surrounding countries may fear him when they hear of it, so as to present themselves to him as his subjects; the second is that the English forbid his best trade, and that is in slaves; he will therefore kill everyone that he catches in war. Some of these poor victims of the Dahomian cutlass have to receive a good flogging, and from a sharp, cutting whip, while their necks are on the blocks ready for the cutlass. The cutting off their heads was not sufficient punishment for the crime of trying to defend themselves or to prevent their being kidnapped and sold for slavery. To say nothing of the number (upwards of 1,500) killed to be the attendants of the late King Gezo in the other world, with bullocks, rams, goats, cocks, drakes, and guinea fowls by the new King, in the great funeral custom of his late father, and who butchered the human beings just in the same way as he did the bullocks &c.—the blood of man and beasts mingled in one hole made on the ground at the gate of the palace—I shall only speak of what is going on now, and that of July and August last. I started from Whydah on the 4th of June, and reached Abomey on the 7th. On my arrival I missed several of the captains, and there were very few men in town. When I made inquiry I learnt that they were gone to attack some place. In about four days the King sent out about 1,600 men for another expedition. On the 15th those who went first returned to Abomey with 600 slaves, men, women, boys and girls, and forty heads of those who made resistance. I was called out to the King's gate to see the train. Each slave is followed by the one who caught him, holding the end of the string. How loud the sight cried for Christian England to help the weak against the mighty! The train comprised several grey-headed men and women. Some of them scarcely could walk. The sick among them were bound in cloth to poles, and carried. Their crime was that they did not come to the custom for his father, and they laughed at those who came from some towns behind them to present things to the King for the custom. The next day the slaves were delivered to the King; the very old ones were put aside to be killed, the young and the middle-aged were put aside to be sold.

Five days after this the second warriors returned with more than 200 slaves. Being disturbed in the counting, I did not get the correct number after the 200.

The slaves were brought to the King, as in the first case. As the captains passed before the King, they prayed him to hasten the time when Abbeokuta shall have no more name amongst the countries in the world.
* **DAHOMEY**: The correspondents of the Wesleyan Missionary Society write from Abeokuta: "The King of Dahomey still threatens to invade Abeokuta in the month of November. May God grant that the calamity be averted, and that we and the Christian inhabitants may be kept in peace and safety!"

The Rev. William West, who has been visiting all the Wesleyan missionary stations on the Gold Coast, writes his impression from intelligence he has received from Mr. Bernasko at Abomey, that "a commissioner, appointed by the British Government, might possibly have some influence, as Mr. Bernasko says that the King is earnestly desirous of seeing a 'real Englishman,' to have a general talk with him. Mr. Bernasko says that the King has been very busy keeping custom for the last four or five weeks (his letter was dated the end of August), and that many have been killed; that some of the Christians brought from Ishagga have been sacrificed; but that he has been informed by some of the chief captains that those Christians who are still alive will be given up to him. I hope this will prove to be the case."

[We are sorry that we have no such hope. We do not believe that any of them have been spared; but if they have been, we feel quite confident that they will not be thus set at liberty. It is not at all our impression that the King of Dahomey will attack Abeokuta during this present month. His inroad into the Abeokutan territory last year was to have been made in November. It did not take place until March, when the alarm had partially subsided, and the people of that doomed place, Ishagga, were off their guard. The dry season, which begins in November, lasts till May, and the expedition against Abeokuta may be made at any time during that period.—Ed. A. T.]
* **Okeodan and Addo**: The establishment of these extensive protectorates must be regarded as a direct and heavy blow struck at the slave-trade. The town of Okeodan is about eighty miles distant from Abomey, and half that distance from Abeokuta; so that British influence will now be brought to bear on a large extent of territory in close proximity to, and until very recently labouring under the fear of invasion by, the King of Dahomey and his marauding and slave-collecting army of sanguinary Amazons. It is but natural to suppose that the King of Dahomey will refrain from any attack upon places under British protection, as his object must be to abstain from acts which will bring him into collision with any civilised Government, especially that of England, toward which he is said to be at this present time very affectionately inclined. Okeodan, until the signing of the treaty with the Government of Lagos, was one of the principal slave-markets in this part of Africa; and not only supplied a large proportion of their *black contraband merchandise* to the Portuguese slavedealers on the Coast, *but acted as middlemen to the natives of Abeokuta, disposing of slaves, the result of Egba wars and kidnappings, to the Portuguese.* These same Egbas some Europeans and English subjects delight to support in their opposition to this Government. The Okeodans have, however, voluntarily agreed to relinquish all participation in the slave-trade. One of the Portuguese slavedealers maintains his establishment within a few yards of the residence of the representatives of the French Government at Porto Novo; but let us hope that Okeodan is for ever lost as the go-between of indigenous and foreign dealers in their fellow men.

Let it not be for one moment supposed that the establishment of protectorates at Okeodan and Addo was brought about by the exercise of any undue pressure on the part of the Lagos Government, or in any spirit of encroachment on the part of the Lieut.-Governor. I am far from saying that the known policy of
* **DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.**: That the King of Dahomey and his imitative subordinate authorities would ere long by their atrocities conspire against the continuance of Dahomey as an independent State, we have always held to be certain. We do not mean that they would proceed to greater extremities in their horrible excesses and barbarous despotism than in the past; but that the time would come when the civilized countries of Europe, and Great Britain in especial, would rouse themselves from their inertia as regards Dahoman atrocities and outrages, and take some effective steps for curbing that savage will in which they have originated. The late visit of the British squadron under Commodore Sir William Hewett to the waters of Whydah, his inquiry into reported outrages committed at that place by the local authorities of the King of Dahomey upon the persons of certain British and French subjects employed in mercantile affairs there, and his imposition of a fine of 500 puncheons of oil, equivalent to the sum of £6,000, to be enforced by blockade if not paid before the end of June next, may be regarded as the first letters of “the handwriting on the wall” foretelling the destruction of a system the devilish action of which, both externally and internally, is at the present time a standing insult to humanity. It is the more significant of “the handwriting on the wall” by a supreme Divine Power, that this first step in the right direction by Great Britain as regards Dahomey should have been made, and most righteously made, by a British naval officer, after consultation with the Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, without any previous communication with, or any direct instructions from, Her Majesty’s Government, at the very time when the Government of France, acting under the malefic influence and representations of the old Marseilles slave-trade interests, should have made difficulties about the acquisition of Gambia, which it has so long and so mightily desired, because it was called upon, as one of the conditions, to relinquish any supposed claims it might have upon a worthless old fort at Whydah, formerly used by French slave-dealers as a slave depôt, and since as mercantile stores. It is, of course, only a logical sequence to what has been done at other parts of the West Coast of Africa, the so-called oil rivers and elsewhere, that the commander of a British squadron should thus inquire into outrages and injuries inflicted by native authorities on British merchants and their employés, impose and levy fines, and stop the trade of the place until those fines were paid. But the present is the first occasion on which this wholesome discipline has been brought to bear upon his Majesty of Dahomey, and we hope from it some very salutary results. Up to the time of our writing there has not been any intelligence received as to the emotions and intentions of the King that may have found expression in words or deeds when he heard of this fine of 500 puncheons of oil, and a blockade if it be not paid at a certain time. He was absent from his capital, engaged with his forces in their annual raid in the Egba countries, mention of which is made in our Abeokuta and Lagos news,—raids which ought not any longer to be permitted by Great Britain, as the interests of her settlement at Lagos are grievously injured thereby,—raids that may be effectually prevented by the cutting off from the King of Dahomey of those supplies of ammunition and other warlike stores which he receives through Whydah. But we fully expect to hear that one of his Majesty’s earliest commands has been the sacrifice of those Whydah authorities who committed the outrages complained of (and inquired into by Sir William Hewett) in their endeavours to satisfy the royal greed, which, as is well known to those acquainted with affairs on the West Coast of Africa, is insatiate, and ever looking to Whydah for renewed supplies. Next, we expect he will offer apologies, and point to his victims, the sacrificed and murdered authorities, as proof that all such deeds had been opposed to his principles, orders, and desires. But this will not do. Not one penny or one gallon of oil of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett ought to be or can be remitted. The decision of a British authority in this matter—a decision arrived at after due inquiry—must be upheld by Her Majesty’s Government as absolute and...
* **ABEOKUTA AND DAHOMEY**: The differences that have arisen between this mighty country of Great Britain and the weak and puny Dahomey, aggravated as they have been by the insensate insolence of King Gélélé in his reply to the demands of Commodore Sir William Hewett, are well worthy to occupy the attention of the authorities and people of Abeokuta. There is one point that we would impress strongly upon them. This is, that Great Britain will not recede from the demands made on the King of Dahomey by Commodore Hewett; and, consequently, that should the blockade of the Dahoman ports, which will commence on the 1st of July next, fail in its object of bringing the King to reason, and to a full compliance with the demands that have been made upon him, other and more effective means will most certainly be employed. What those means must necessarily be it is not at all difficult to imagine. The Power that directed the long and difficult march on the capital of Ashanti is not likely to shrink from the comparatively short and easy march on Abomey. It is, therefore, well that the authorities and people of Abeokuta should set themselves at once earnestly to consider what it will be their duty and their interest to do should it become necessary for Great Britain to adopt such extreme measures against their bitter and inveterate enemy. Dahomey has been and, unless its power be broken and destroyed, or it be restrained by engagements entered into with Great Britain, will continue to be, year by year, a ruinous curse to the Egba people. Year by year it has invaded their territory, cruelly butchered most of those whom it could surprise in the open villages and farms between the frontier of Dahomey and Abeokuta, and carried off the remainder of them for more protracted torture and more cruel death in the fearful "Customs" of Abomey. Every Egba heart that has in it a spark of love of country ought to beat high with hope of entire deliverance from the attacks of so cruel a foe, and with eagerness to assist in that work of retribution which has been too long delayed. Although the Egbas, not being themselves an organized military power, like Dahomey, have never been able of themselves, when they have turned back the tide of invasion from the walls of Abeokuta, to pursue their enemy into the Dahoman territory, they must certainly be quite as capable of supporting the fatigues of a march on Abomey, and of providing themselves with the necessary provisions for such a march, as ever the Dahomans were to support the fatigues and provide themselves with provisions for their marches on Abeokuta. It would be their duty and for their interests, therefore, to take part in any chastisement to be inflicted by Great Britain on Dahomey. To enable them to do this at the proper moment, they ought at once to decide upon what their expeditionary force shall be, and to arrange the necessary supply of provisions for it; so that should the moment for action arrive, they may be able to take advantage of that moment, and proceed without delay to the frontier of Dahomey—to those river fords over which the King and his Amazons have so often passed to burn their villages and farms, and slaughter and carry away captive, for a more fearful butchery during their "Customs," the laborious and unoffending Egbas. We imagine that there could be but one feeling in Abeokuta on this subject, and that is, a firm determination to show themselves worthy of their ancient fame, and to assist in putting an end at once and for ever to all possibility of any future invasions by Kings of Dahomey. As is the duty of the people of Abeokuta, such also is the duty of the Akus everywhere along the West Coast. Although they cannot go themselves to such a war, they can assist their brethren in Abeokuta in many important ways, which it ought not to be necessary for us to detail. There is only one further remark that we would make at present. Let it not enter into the heads of the authorities and people of Abeokuta, or of the Akus in the British Settlements, or elsewhere along the West Coast, that their co-operation in the way we have pointed out is at all indispensable to Great Britain. Great Britain *alone* is quite equal to the task of capturing and destroying a hundred Abomeys, if there were such, without assistance from, or the co-operation of, the Egbas, whether in or out of Abeokuta. We have merely pointed out to them what true honour and patriotism, and a correct appreciation of their own future interests, should counsel and impel them to do. We have done our duty in putting this plainly before them; we shall see how they will perform theirs should the occasion arise.
* **West Coast of Africa News**: WEST COAST OF AFRICA NEWS.

**THE BLOCKADE OF DAHOMEY.**—The African Steamship Company's steamer Ambriz, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 15, reports that trade on the coast is still very bad. There is no change as regards the blockade of the Dahoman ports, but the general opinion amongst the shippers and traders seems to be that the King will not hold out much longer, and that he will accede to the English demands.

**PROPOSED OPERATIONS AGAINST THE KING OF DAHOMEY.**—The British and African Steam Navigation Company's steamship Congo arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 17 from the West and South-west Coast of Africa. On the South Coast everything was very dull and quiet, trade was bad, and the weather unusually cold. The natives up the River Niger were quiet, and trade was improving there since Commodore Hewett's expedition; but in all the other rivers, and up the West Coast, business was extremely dull. Dahoman news was very limited. There was a rumour at Quittah of a raid having been made on Abeokuta, south of Whydah, but this was not authenticated. The blockade was still maintained, and it was confidently stated that the Commodore had requested from the Government the services of 500 white troops, the 1st West India Regiment, and 600 Houssas for immediate operations against the King of Dahomey. In consequence of this, the departure of the 1st West India Regiment from Sierra Leone to the West Indies has been deferred to March next. Some cases of smuggling spirits and tobacco at several ports in the vicinity of Cape Coast Castle had just come to light, and some of the Custom House officials were in trouble. It was feared that when the matter came to be fully investigated, the practice would be found to have been carried on on a large scale. The weather on the West Coast was fine and excessively hot.

**MADEIRA, NOV. 28.**—The African Steamship Company's Royal Mail steamer Benin, with mails, passengers, and specie from the West Coast of Africa, left here at 7 p.m. to-day for Liverpool.

The steamer Corisco which arrived at Liverpool on Nov. 28, reports that there was no change as regards the Dahomey blockade. It was still being continued rigorously, but it was understood that the King was prepared to make a determined resistance to any attack, and had collected a large army at Whydah to receive the first invaders. It was generally believed that the inhabitants themselves, who have long wished to throw over the severe rule of the present king, would be quite ready to side with the English should the latter send any troops, but they are too much in dread of their old ruler to make an active demonstration of their feelings.
* **OPERATIONS AGAINST DAHOMEY.**: We purposely resisted the temptation to comment on the late news from the Coast, that Sir William Hewett had asked for 500 European troops, 1st West India Regiment, and 600 Houssas, for an invasion of Dahomey; but the frequent London Correspondent of the Standard in this matter of Dahomey, a former West Coast official, having indited a long letter on the subject, some brief remarks on our part seem to be necessary. We think this correspondent takes an exaggerated view of the fighting resources of Dahomey, of the mortal peril of the European detenus there, and of the reckless character of King Gelélé. Affect what he may, this wretched thing of a King will be too wise to cut himself off from all possibility of future reconciliation with Great Britain, which he would do by murdering the Europeans now within his power, as we presume a preliminary summons would be made, in which the King would be distinctly informed that in the event of his injuring those persons, he would open a gulf between himself and the British that could only be closed up by his own dead body. There are some observations, however, in the letter which are so much in keeping with views we have expressed with regard to the Ashanti War and the Dahoman one, should it take place, that we have pleasure in reproducing them. He says, most justly, "If, however, our troops do intend pushing on to Abomey and giving King Gelélé a lesson, we trust that a more effectual one will be administered than in the case of his neighbour of Ashanti. It will not be enough if we march through the town with colours flying, driving a frightened herd of women and children before us, and finally set fire to a few thatched mud huts, and then hurry back to the coast. Gelélé, should danger menace him, will, in all probability, take to the bush, and, if such should be the case, we ought not to retire until he has been dragged from his concealment, and brought face to face with the commander of the expedition." The only modification we should make in the above is that the lesson we should give to Gelélé should not stop at anything short of the breaking up of that Power which, so long as it continues to exist, will never cease to offer up its hecatombs of victims at the behest of the sanguinary superstitions which have made Dahomey so odious to all civilized peoples. The concluding remarks we, of course, endorse, since they are in favour of a policy that we have advocated from the first hour in which we heard of the new Gold Coast Colony being proclaimed: "Finally, we would again urge the necessity there exists of forming a continuous coast-line of British territory from the Assinee River to Lagos. Until this happy event becomes consummated, the traders of the West Coast will ever be subjected to the capricious treatment of petty kinglets, while our revenue will be defrauded by the smuggling, which such gaps render only too easy of performance." King Gelélé has offered to us an opportunity for realizing this, and it would be the very climax of folly not to avail ourselves of it to the fullest extent.
* **The British Operations in the Gambia**: 

In *Payne's Lagos Almanack*, about ten years ago, attention was drawn to the injury which was being done to the more peaceful tribes of Yorubaland: "Few people know the full extent of the sufferings endured by the population of the lower and western part of the Yoruba country, from year to year, and caused by the annual raids made by the Dahomeyans. From the boundary of their territory to the town of Abeokuta the distance is, as the crow flies, about 85 miles of land, which is inhabited by the Yoruba tribes of the Ketus and Egbados. Towards the south lies the territory of Porto Novo, Ado, Ota, Badagry; the whole extending north to south about 45 miles. This gives an area of about 3,000 square miles of land inhabited by industrious farm labourers; it is the region from which we draw our supply of animal and vegetable provisions, the country which to a large degree supplies the trade of Lagos; the Ijebu country in the east being as yet only open on its coast line. Now what is the result of the annual inroads of the Dahomeyans into this territory? Let it be understood that the inhabitants of these 3,000 square miles do not, for one-third of the year, feel themselves safe from attack, and that this third of the year is the most important part of the year to the farmers—the planting time. It has happened during the last few years that the poor farmers have been lingering about their farms preparing them for the planting of yams, Indian corn, and other things, when the enemy has fallen upon them and carried them away, so that the authorities of Abeokuta have now forbidden them to remain in their farm-villages during this season of danger. But what is the consequence of all this? People fear the breaking out of famine in Abeokuta—a large town inhabited by 100,000 farmers. What an anomaly in a country so thinly populated, and deprived, as it has been so largely, of its able-bodied labourers, by a century of the slave-trade, and yet so it is. This very year the Dahomeyan hordes hunted the country up and down, making towns and villages unsafe, kidnapping on a large scale—refugees from Ota came even here to Lagos—until they finally pounced upon two villages in the Ketu country, which they completely sacked, and returned loaded with plunder. Under such circumstances, how can trade flourish, when people are unable to obtain the necessaries of life, and when their town is threatened with famine? It is but little likely that he who is in anxiety about the needful harvest will take much trouble to gather in palm-nuts, which ripen during the same first four months of the year, or to gather in the cotton which at the same time whitens his fields. Both must rot or be destroyed by birds and insects. It is not easy to imagine how great the amount of produce would be that might be obtained from this extensive region if those yearly raids were put a stop to. One strange feature in the case is, that this happens so near to Lagos—only some twenty miles from the lagoon, which is navigable nearly the whole of the before-mentioned eighty-five miles of territory. The loss arising from these raids is not by any means confined to the people who are the first to suffer; but the trade of Lagos, whether as regards that done in the direction of Abeokuta, Badagry, or Porto Novo, suffers most seriously. It is to be hoped that England will not overlook this matter when the time for settlement with the King of Dahomey comes. If he can be restrained, both humanity and commerce will gain greatly by it."

## The Dahomian king utilized annual ceremonies as a form of political theater to assert his authority, reinforce his legitimacy through his father's legacy, display power and wealth, and establish a centralized political structure with tributary obligations and a regulated system of taxation.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced understanding of the Dahomian king's use of annual ceremonies as a form of political theater. While the textbook does not explicitly mention the Dahomian king or the specific use of ceremonies, it discusses the broader context of African states, including Dahomey, emphasizing the need to centralize power, extract surpluses, and maintain a standing military force. This context aligns with the claim that the Dahomian king might have used ceremonies to assert authority and reinforce legitimacy. The textbook also highlights the importance of centralized political structures and tributary obligations, which could be analogous to a regulated system of taxation. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim, describing how the Dahomian king utilized annual ceremonies to assert his authority and reinforce his legitimacy through his father's legacy. The articles detail the commemoration of victory over the Ayors, with elaborate displays involving Amazons and singers, and symbolic acts like having twelve Ayor people carry silk damask and cotton shirting, signifying the end of tributary obligations. This supports the claim of using ceremonies to display power and wealth and suggests a regulated system of taxation through the collection of tribute and extortionate demands. However, the articles do not explicitly address the establishment of a centralized political structure, a notable difference from the claim. Together, these sources illustrate the king's use of ceremonies to assert authority and display power, while highlighting gaps in the discussion of centralized political structures.

* **Political structures**: Of the major states that survived from the eighteenth century, few could have done so without major internal reform. This was because the intense political rivalry and the need to control the expanding scope of commercial relations created such new challenges that each state either tried to reform and expand at the expense of its neighbours or faced disintegration and fragmentation. Few were allowed, like Benin, to merely contract and survive.$^{7}$ Most, like, for example, Asante, Dahomey and Buganda, had constantly to maintain and even improve on their efficiency largely in terms of the ability of the ruler to centralize power, weaken subordinates, extract more and more surpluses from them; monopolize major economic and stragetic resources; institutionalize a hierarchy of officials dependent on the ruler for appointment, advancement and discipline; and sustain these powers by the establishment and control of a standing military force, commanded by officials similarly dependent on the ruler. This veritable revolution was sometimes achieved without an obvious change of political system; sometimes, as in the case of Borno, it necessitated a change of dynasty.$^{8}$ Often there was a compromise as 'new men' were appointed to old chieftaincies and made to function in new bureaucratic ways, or new offices came to acquire something of the ethos of older traditional titles.
* **On the eve of the nineteenth century**: Allowing for differences in detail, the Shona and Lunda states were structured around similar organizational principles. At the apex stood a king believed to have sacred qualities that were either inherent in kingship or acquired through rites of investiture. The ruler's intimate relationship with the supernatural, sanctified by spirit mediums and cult priests, ensured the health and well-being of his subjects and the fertility of the land. The interrelationship between kingship and fertility underpinned the mys› tification of the ruler and reinforced his position as symbolic owner and spiritual guardian of the land. As a result, he retained the exclusive right to allocate land, which was the basis of control over subordinate chiefs and other subjects and underpinned a cycle of reciprocity. In repayment for the opportunity to use the king's land and benefit from his divine prowess, his subjects were expected to provide specified taxes, labour service and tribute that varied from one kingdom to another. Throughout both state systems, moreover, the largest tusk of a dead elephant automatically belonged to the monarch as owner of the land. In some societies, such as Manica, the Lunda of Kazembe, and Undi, the monarch also maintained a theoretical monopoly over commerce, while in Changamire's kingdom the ruler was the ultimate owner of most cattle.$^{5}$ These tribute, labour and commercial arrangements enhanced the power and wealth of the monarch, who redistributed to his principal lieutenants a portion of the surplus which he extracted, to ensure their continued loyalty. In this respect the precolonial central African states organized the flow of scarce resources from the dominated classes to the dominant class. 6
* **Political structures**: The Mfecane spread far and wide a new model of the northern Nguni state as revolutionized by Shaka. The new state involved basically the adaptation of the age-grade system to create what was virtually a standing army. This ranged far and wide to recruit young men into the army and women as wives, all at the disposal of the king to whom all resources belonged, including cattle and agricultural produce with which to sustain the army and an expanding court. It also involved acculturation of con› quered peoples into the dominant culture, and an entirely new conception of the relationship between the ruler and the ruled.$^{9}$ The personality of the ruler and the quality of his leadership still seemed to have mattered more than the structures of the state, and the state was often rent apart by the family feuds of the royal lineage. But there is no doubt that for all the initial devastation and confusion created, the Mfecane succeeded in establishing several larger, more efficient and stronger states, with more durable structures than had existed previously. The new states also had more-clearly defined frontiers, if only because they made such demands on the ruled that there could be little doubt about the extent or limits of jurisdiction. The ruler might still exploit his headship of different religious cults but, increasingly, he was ceasing to be merely a ritual leader. His managerial, administrative and military capabilities as effective and execu› tive head of the state machine became more important than the network of kinship and ritual connections, though in some cases these continued to be important as ideology and source of legitimization.
* **Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Ethiopia**: The lord possessed certain rights known as gulf, essentially the right to collect tribute in kind from each household in the district and to appropriate labour for work on his farms or on other projects he might designate. Part of the tribute was retained for his own use, and the remainder was transmitted to his overlord - the provincial governor. He adjudicated cases and disputes in the district, mobilized and commanded the local militia, and organized public works to develop the district (besides ensuring that his 'parish', often coterminous with the district, discharged its obligations to the local Ethiopian Orthodox church).$^{14}$ As a rule, the obligations due to the lord or church from the district's population, based primarily on their attachment to land for livelihood, were comparatively light in the Amhara-Tigre core provinces. There, land was owned and controlled by the rist system, that is, mostly by individual lineages; it was practically inalienable and was therefore unavailable for distribution by the emperor or governor for patronage purposes. The obligations were heavy in the regions in the south and west conquered by Menelik, where the lords and naftanyas (literally 'gunbearers': settlers from the Abyssinian highlands) greatly exploited the people partly through gult rights and obligations. 1 5 The provincial governors performed functions similar to those of the lords but on a larger scale. Those in the Amhara-Tigre core were recruited mostly from the emperor's close relatives or from local noblemen presumed loyal to the emperor. Governors of the newly conquered regions in the south and west where alienable land was available, were predominantly Amhara, Shoan, Tigrean or other northern noble or military men who received gult rights (or rut-gult land in lieu of governorship) for their services to the emperor. Thus continued loyalty to the governor or emperor greatly depended on the availability of gult for rewards, and of military power to enforce authority. ' 6 The emperor was the most important single factor in the imperial system. He performed institutionalized executive, legislative, and judicial functions which have been classified by Christopher Clapham as 'protective', 'extrac› tive and distributive', 'regulative', and 'symbolic'. The emperor personally led his army, managed imperial affairs, and dispensed justice and patronage. More importantly perhaps, the emperor symbolized national unity and independence by virtue of his alleged descent from the Biblical King Solomon and
* **Patterns of authority**: Kano and Bunafu thus represented two different models of the way in which the power structure affected agricultural development in Africa in the early nineteenth century, one where authority was centralized and structured, the other where it was diffuse and informal. This is not a distinction between 'state' and 'stateless' societies as anthropologists have earlier suggested. In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure**: In the case of Katsina, the original, rather limited lineage-based cen› tralization gave way, in the face of militarism, to an increasingly autocratic palace government. These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.
So far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.
In larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi. The links between these representatives of the local population and the upper levels of the administration were in the hands ofjakadu, servants or agents of the office-holder allocated the responsibility for that section of the population. Similarly, messengers linked the office-holder to his amir. The function of the administration was primarily tax collection, but this was as much a political as an economic act; to pay was also a symbolic act of submission, to refuse payment was a token of rebellion. As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns. Some indication of the administrative work in the late nineteenth century has been preserved in the correspondence which has been kept by descendants of officials in Sokoto, Gombe and Bauchi.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The political organization of Liptako represented an attempt to maintain a balance between the clans, and this was reflected in its very structures. Power was transmitted through patrilineal descent from Saidu, the father of that Brahima who had led the djihäd. However, the Ferrobe eventually decided or agreed that their antagonists, the Torodbe, should constitute the electoral college that designated the amir. The college investigated each candidate's personal qualities, such as justice and piety, as well as the services he had rendered, the extent of his matrimonial alliances, and the like, and finally gave a decision. By means of this participation, the Torodbe, even though they were debarred from wielding power themselves, were placed in a position where they could in a sense decide among the Ferrobe claimants, and this served to integrate them into the system. 43 Once the new amir had been tentatively selected, he was subjected to an interview and asked trick questions. Then animals were sacrificed to the genii and to a sacred snake. A new traditional drum was made, to be included among the symbols of power granted by the Sokoto council. 44 The new amir's head was swathed in a turban by one of the Torodbe in the presence of the chief imam and the kadi, and facing the standard he swore to respect the customs and principles of Islam and to maintain the welfare of his people. This was a ritual of political and religious renewal of cosmic dimensions, designed to appease supernatural forces of all descriptions. The religious authorities were appointed by the kadi of Dori and were invested with judicial power as courts of appeal. In addition, there was a network of village imams, headed by the chief imam of Dori.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80**: In 1820 the Sokoto caliphate was composed of some seven major emirates with a further ten large emirates still in the process of formation. Borno too was re-established after the retreat from its capital and the loss of extensive areas in the west and south. In order to understand the changes implied by the terms 'caliphate' and 'emirate', let us briefly and very schematically recapitulate the old political system the reformers had replaced.
The most notable feature of the old system was the role of the king, known variously as mai, sarki, etsu, alafin. Before the shifts in power in the late eighteenth century, the king had ritual functions and a role that required a certain seclusion from the public; the palace was more sacred than a mere house. The king was more or less above politics, a symbol of great authority in whose name all acts were done; he represented the state. A number of men and women who as slaves or eunuchs were without kin or heirs were servants dedicated to the palace and the king's person; they formed one section of the administration. Another section was formed by large independent households with hereditary claims to titles, the holders of which thus had their own followings of men. A third section was the family of the king, particularly the king's mother or sister, his brothers and sons. The composition of councils and bodies responsible for rituals or for military leadership varied in detail from state to state, often with the palace slaves and the free office-holders divided into orders through which individuals could move by promotion. Political competition was limited to the offices under the king. As far as we know there were in the late eighteenth century trends for kings to take a more active part in politics, to become more exclusively Muslim and to promote reforms on the lines of Islamic government.$^{6}$ Economically, it seems that it was a period of rising levels of consumption (particularly of cotton cloth) and demand for slaves; and there was a need to regulate the expanding market and protect it. The effects of these changes reverberated down to the trading, farming and pastoral communities in the countryside, as those involved in political competition sought to strengthen their hold on their bases of power; as a consequence of which the ¿jihad found widespread support among the victims of these changes.
* **Purposes and impositions of colonialism**: Within this general pattern there were many regional distinctions, the most prominent being that connected with Lugard's idea of 'native authority'. As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.
Of all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion. In 1936, special African clerks were appointed to collect taxes in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), another indication of this bureaucratic trend.
* **Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Ethiopia**: and 'symbolic'. The emperor personally led his army, managed imperial affairs, and dispensed justice and patronage. More importantly perhaps, the emperor symbolized national unity and independence by virtue of his alleged descent from the Biblical King Solomon and his coronation and anointment by the abuna, the Egyptian head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. 1 7 The imperial system inherited by Tewodros lacked a notable 'historic bureaucracy'.$^{18}$ Excepting comparatively few offices with well-defined functions like the Tsahafe Tezaz (Imperial Secretary) and the Afa-Negus (Chief Justice), the imperial administration was largely personalized in the emperor and his regional representatives: the governors and lords. 19 Tewodros himself attempted to create a bureaucracy by often replacing existing governors of aristocratic stock by paid army generals of humble birth, loyal to, and dependent on him. But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre. Both systems were solidly based on privilege at the core, and extensively utilized patronage and assimilation techniques. Nevertheless, whereas Ethiopia's imperial system was largely 'African', lacking political parties or parliament - Tewodros, Yohannes and Menelik became Emperor by virtue of their superior military power over their rivals, and not through the ballot box - Liberia's central government was thoroughly western. At any rate, each system possessed or developed the mechanisms and instruments necessary for containing European aggression unleashed by the Scramble and partition.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The local power structure was also designed to provide a place for the older Fulbe clans which could not aspire to the office of amir: the jooro (village headmen) were selected from the ranks of the heads of families of more ancient lineage. Jelgoji had a similar system for incorporating all clans within a single structure: the chief was elected by an electoral college made up of aged notables of SadaabØ descent, i.e. representatives of the people who had been dominant in the region before the arrival of the JelgobØ, whereas only a member of the latter could actually be chief. In practice, the chief was invariably a member of the Nyorgo family. The insignia of the office was a staff (symbolizing stock-breeding) hung with various kinds of agricultural products. Here again, the material prosperity of the new chiefs reign was secured by means of sacrifices carried out by the indigenous Kurumba.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure**: century in emirates of type ib - Gombe, Katagum - were centrifugal. Paradoxically, in Bauchi decentralization was necessary again in order to forestall centrifugal revolts, but by further diminishing the value of offices available to the amir's kin at the centre (where after a period of centralization the palace administration with its personal advisers and slave officials had grown relatively strong), decentralization only heightened competition for the sole remaining, really important office, that of amir. The consequence was a disastrous war within and around the capital "\I88I-2.
* **Political structures**: Seku Ahmadu, who had succeeded al-Hadjdj 'Umar Tal shortly after Massina had been incorporated into the empire, had to battle both with internal dynastic rivalries and the hostility of the French, which further encouraged dissident groups from within. In spite of such difficulties and limitations, the empire had provided an overall framework of state, legal principles and administrative structures that united a wide range of peoples over the vast empire. State structures apart, the TijÆni order provided a faith and way of life that acted as a further bond of unity and loyalty to the ruler. The example of the Dinguiraye revolution encouraged many religious leaders to extend the djihad into other areas, to replace secularminded Muslims and traditionalists with clerics seeking to establish Islamic theocracies. Thus, in the disintegrated empire of Jolof, the states of Kayor (Cayor) and Wolof came under the rule of clerics, and began to extend Islam as a factor of reform in Senegambia. Among the southern Mandinka where Muslims were in a minority, Samori Ture, a Joola (Dyula) warrior with a commercial background, sought to use Islam to unify his peoples irrespective of whether they were previously Muslim or traditionalists. 12 We find Islam serving the same purpose in Nupe and Ilorin, where rulers embraced Islam with its tradition of literacy and pattern of political and social institutions not only to convert a traditional ritual kingship into an executive theocratic state, but also as a factor of conversion to facilitate expansion among non-Muslim peoples.
* **Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies**: Mirambo's method of control in his 'empire' was based on the imposition of military power on the traditional system..Conquered rulers were required to acknowledge his over-rule by occasionally sending him tributes of ivory and young men for his army. Where there was resistance from a traditional ruler, Mirambo removed him and replaced him with a more submissive member of the same ruling family. Where a conquered province was near a powerful kingdom, Mirambo kept armed men of his own there. But his main method of control was that of keeping his army constantly on the move to intimidate both his neighbours and his subjects.
Nyungu ya Mawe's 'empire' was better integrated than that of Mirambo. Nyungu ya Mawe, like Mirambo, used the ruga-ruga to establish himself among the Kimbu. Between 1870 and 1880 he campaigned from his base in Kiwele and gained control of the trade route to the coast east of Tabora and the southbound route from Tabora to Ufipa and Lake Tanganyika. Among the conquered states Nyungu posted his own officials called vatwale, who were directly responsible to him. In his 'empire' the real rulers were no longer the traditional chiefs but the appointed vatwale. It was the duty of these officials to collect and forward to Nyungu all the ivory obtained in the kingdom. The area under each appointed official consisted of a number of traditional states. Therefore the Kimbu traditional states, num› bering about thirty, were ruled by about six or seven vatwale. 11 Mirambo and Nyungu ya Mawe were contemporaries. Both built up polities based on the changed material conditions of the late nineteenth century. Both Nyungu and Mirambo died in 1884. Because Nyungu made innovations in the administrative structure of his 'empire', when he died it survived until it was dismantled by the colonialists. On the other hand, Mirambo's 'empire' broke up into its constituent states simply because there was no successor who could maintain the strong army required to keep it together.
* **Purposes and impositions of colonialism**: In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official. However, the most peculiar and inequitable element in the French system was the indigØnat.$^{23}$ First employed in Algeria in the 1870s, this device was imported into French West Africa in the 1880s and remained institutionally operative there as well as in Algeria until the end of the Second World War. Regularized by a decree of 1924, it allowed any French administrator to impose a punishment of up to fifteen days gaol sentence and a fine for a series of infractions ranging from failure to pay taxes on time to displaying discourtesy to French officials.
More pervasive in effect than the legal systems were the personal taxes which all African males eventually encountered. Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy. By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime. Between the wars there were attempts to graduate this tax on a regional basis or on an assess› ment of the potential yield of the land. Lastly, there was the income tax, introduced in the 1920s into several British territories and the Belgian Congo, but then primarily affecting non-Africans who generally were the only ones with sufficient income to be required to pay it.
* **Political structures**: Khedive Ismail revived and advanced this spirit of reform, employing Europeans to supervise abolitionist and commercial ventures in the Sudan, completing the cutting of the Suez Canal and constructing other canals and irrigation works, railways, communication systems and the like. His aim was, within the limitations of Ottoman overlordship, which European powers exploited to impose unfair treaties to entrench their interests, to buy European technology to modernize Egyptian structures and institutions. 11 Ostensibly, the aim of the djiKäi movements was to recreate classical Islamic institutions of the time of the orthodox caliphs. In more practical io. See Chapter 15, above. See above R. A. Caulk, 1972. terms, it was to create Islamic theocratic states in place of traditional societies ruled by Muslims and traditionalists. It was to instal rulers chosen for their learning and piety and dedicated to running the affairs of the state on the principles of the Ku'ran and Islamic laws, and committed to establishing truly Islamic institutions. By the 1870s, the successors of the founders in Sokoto had achieved a fair measure of success. Under the overall supervision of the caliph, the individual amirs had certainly achieved more durable political structures than the Hausa rulers they had displaced. It is true that in many respects the rulers and the aristocratic classes around them had re-absorbed many of the Hausa nobility and privileges of fiefholders and merchant princes. However, the relative degree of peace that the caliphate enjoyed, the attention to markets, industries, crafts and trade routes, the power of judges and other officials and the control of amirs over the officials, all ensured a higher degree of executive authority in the state.
* **The situation of Ethiopia in the first decades of the century > The Oromo states**: The regions south of the Blue Nile were inhabited by traditionalist Oromo, who, early in the century, were in a state ofpolitical flux. The old egalitarian gada system involving rule by rotating age-groups was challenged by rich and powerful military leaders, often known by the title of abba dula or 'father of war', who began to claim life-long authority and the right to establish dynasties. In the first decades of the century, three Oromo monarchies emerged: Enarya (also known as Limmu), Goma, and Guma to the west.47 Enarya, the most powerful, was ruled by Bofu, an able chief who, to strengthen his power, accepted the advice of Muslim merchants and embraced Islam. He was succeeded by his son Ibsa, or Abba Bagibo (1825-61), who forged dynastic alliances with neighbouring ruling houses and obtained a number of matchlock guns from Gojam, which gave him an impregnable position. During his long reign trade, mainly in slaves, gold, ivory and civet, flourished, and the kingdom became rich and power¬ ful, though the expansion of Shoa later severed the trade route to Harar and the ports of the Gulf of Aden, and Abba Bagibo's death was followed by the rapid decline of the polity he had built.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure**: The emirates of type 1 are more numerous and so more varied. Cen› tralized or decentralized residence is a quick but superficial criterion for distinguishing between these emirates. Decentralized residence implies a category of intermediaries at the capital, who at the outset might be seen as 'clients' of the amir. But they, given the lineage idiom of the political system, developed lineages of their own; in consequence, the amir created a further category of clients from those unable to develop lineages, namely palace slaves, but they played a minor role. Centralized residence, in contrast, implied no such category of intermediaries between office-holder and amir, but in time the amir developed a palace slave retinue to act as his personal agents, and they played an important role in government. Centralized residence also implied that the office-holder could have charge of a number of widely dispersed towns, villages or peoples (thus preventing any territorial blocs of power), whereas decentralized residence usually meant that the office-holder's headquarters were within an area that owed allegiance to him as a whole, with only a few, if any, villages likely to owe extra-territorial allegiance to another office.
Residence as a criterion cannot be applied too strictly. Many emirates modified their residence rules for various offices in the course of the century (for example, the office of Madaki of Bauchi was transferred back to the capital from Wase early in the century); many offices had more than one residence and the exact allocation of time spent in which place is not known, nor is it known how often an office-holder outside the capital might ride in for important meetings. Finally, the relative importance of offices could change, so that in an emirate like Bauchi, power under the amir seems in the course of the century to have oscillated between offices at the centre and offices in some of the territories. But residence does reflect conditions early in the history of each emirate, and draws attention to important economic and political differences between the emirates.
* **Borno, 1820-80 > The second period, 1855-80: the Borno Shaykhdom**: If this analysis of Borno politics in terms of patron-clientage is correct (and it is the analysis of R. Cohen and L. Brenner), such a system had its origins in al-Kânâmrs use of slaves and a few friends to run his early administration.$^{31}$ Because of the country's divided loyalty, with the older lineages probably following the mat, the Shaykh^ did not take over a hereditary administration; and the deaths of äEtCänärnfs councillors in the disorders of 1846-54 cut short any development in that direction. Members of the man's administration too were discredited after 1846. It is difficult to see, then, what other form of political recruitment Shaykh 'Umar could have used at the time. It may however be an anachronism to treat patronclientage as the traditional Borno system, or even as the dominant system in the early nineteenth century. Al-Känämfs councillors primarily were not his clients but his partners, with a considerable degree of inde› pendence - thus their crucial role in the events following al-Känämfs death. Ministerial dynasties were then still a possible development. I would suggest, after all, that there was a marked political change after the period 1845-55,$^{ Dut on}$e made easier by simply extending over the whole political spectrum the principle al-Kânâmï used in his appointment of slave officials.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: It would appear that basically contending interests penetrated the Western Sudan zone of West Africa during the colonial period, the colonial or European and the Muslim represented by the Dyula. The conditions for this resided in the social structure of the people of the Western Sudan. The traditional caste system of the Western Sudanese, which recognized the authority of skilled craft groups over the related materials and geographical territory of their craft and its practice, accorded to the iman or alim (Islamic intructor) a monopoly of authority over the province of literacy, writing and communication, and also indirectly over commercial relations that developed with European colonialism.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In about a week after this he started for Kanna, one of his chief towns, about eight miles east of Abomey, where he has a large palace.

It will be tedious to mention all the ceremonies; but on July the 2nd, which was a day only for the chiefs to hear the singers in their respective places, the King came out unexpectedly, having before him twelve Ayor people, holding in their hands a piece of silk damask and one piece of cotton shirting, went round the market three times, then came and sat himself about ten feet from where I was sitting, looking on the dancing and hearing the singing, and called audience, and told the reasons of what he had done; and that was, the former kings served the Nago Ayors, and paid heavy tribute yearly, and that those who were sent to collect the tribute were such extortioners, that they would claim nothing but silk damask and that kind of shirting. Such treatment all the former kings underwent, except his late father, who would not submit; he therefore turned to and fought them, and became conqueror over them.

Presently came on two of the poor Ayors bound in baskets, each being carried by two of the Amazons. Next came an alligator and a cat, bound in the same way. Next came six of the Ayors. In the same manner a few other things passed, and then came four more, all bound as described, only in cases instead of baskets. His wives were the last, dressed with silks of different kinds.

The cowries, cloths, tobacco, and the other things, except the furniture, were thrown over to his people from a sort of platform on which he goes to stand, and the poor Ayors were thrown from the platform, except two he pardoned. These poor fellows were not criminals; they were people caught in war some time ago, and kept in prison. This custom lasted twenty days, and there were more than fifty killed before I left Kanna for Whydah.

The King was to start from Kanna to Abomey, to hold the Horses' Custom, but the month of September being evil moon to them, no custom must be held in it; so that the custom was postponed to October.

The King started at the appointed time for Abomey. All the Whydah chiefs who had returned home started again for Dahomey. The custom commenced as soon as the Yevoga of Whydah reached Dahomey.

Dahomey has two customs, which come in turns annually. One is Attor, and the other Sorsi. The former is a sort of platform erected (with sticks), on which the King has to sit or stand, to throw things to his people. The latter is a shed supported by several poles, and to each pole people appointed to be killed at a certain period of the custom are fastened one by one. The late King never exceeded thirty men at a time in all the days of his reign.

This latter custom is what is going on now.

Instead of one shed, he made double, one on the other, and ninety men fastened to the poles, and there was not one pardoned—every one was killed.
* **THE GOLD COAST.**: **THE GOLD COAST.**

*(Extract from the Account of a Journey made to Whydah by Mr. W. B. George, Native Catechist. dated July, 1875.)*

**Porto Novo.**—The first thing that occupies the attention of a stranger here is the filthy state of the country and habits of the people; the effluvium here is frightful and destructive generally. The next object that attracted my attention was the palm of a dead man's hand suspended upon a gate, in token of victory gained over Egbas during the late hostility between the Porto Novans and that nation. On proceeding through the market, I saw skulls of human beings, over ten in number, exhibited on poles as an example to thieves and murderers. Hard by the King's palace are innumerable skulls of human beings placed upon an elevation of wood erected for that purpose, and adorned with palm-leaves. Besides these there are fetishes of all kinds to be seen in every corner of the streets, in every gate and in every house; and though the country is so excessively populated, yet nothing like civility or godliness is to be noticed in the manners of the people. Ignorance, barbarity, and filth are to be seen here in their true colour.

**Godome,** where we landed, is equal to Porto Novo in point of degradation; for in the former we can boast of a chapel, but there is not a single place of worship of any kind to be found here. There are fetishes and images of all kinds and forms to be seen in every corner of the streets, to which the inhabitants pay due homage. I was conducted into the palace of the King, who, I was sorry to find, was absent, as he was on his way to Dahomey on a summons from the King, to witness the celebration of the yearly custom, as well as all other chiefs. Foreigners, &c., are also summoned to witness this dreadful ceremony, in which the lives of many are to be destroyed. The King is a terror to his people; all are therefore bound to obey his call. The very scene at the King's gate in Godome is frightful. Just opposite are three terrible images of moulded earth, sitting down, in the form of men, and having their arms folded. In the first apartment I noticed three men sitting down, chained by their necks and waists, and with a heap of palm kernels placed before them, which I saw them breaking and chewing. These are called the King's prisoners. I had to pass them as quickly as possible, for fear of involving myself in the King's quarrel. On going through the King's palace I met all his courtiers reclining in the verandah: each shook my hand, gave me a seat, and then inquired the cause of my visit. My guide told them we were missionaries going to establish the Gospel in Little Popo, and asked them in the meantime to grant us permission to pass to
**[FEB. 1, 1876.]**
* **THE GOLD COAST.**: 

**Whydah.** They promised to grant us this as soon as we were ready to depart. On the night of the 27th inst. Prince Gbo, who succeeded the King during his absence, called upon me where I put up. We sat in long conversation, and I seized an opportunity to direct it to the subject of religion, and asked him whether he would not like to have the Gospel preached in his country. Poor man! he could not understand what I meant by the terms "preaching the Gospel," but after a little explanation he seemed to like it, but confessed that nothing of the kind could be allowed to be introduced into his country without the sanction of the King of Dahomey. On Monday morning, the 28th inst., having procured carriers, we left for the next station, about eight to twelve miles from Godome, where we hoped to procure a canoe for Whydah. Along the way from Godome to the wharf is occupied by an extensive course of water about three or four feet deep, and no stranger can get through without going by hammock. Accordingly I procured one, to be carried by four men. Leaving Godome at seven, we went through, and whilst two men bore the hammock upon their shoulders, the other two had to raise me up by the shoulders and waist, so as to prevent my being dragged along through the water: this occupies a course of about five to six miles' distance. As there are many custom-houses by the way, to whose officers we were bound to pay tribute, my guide told me that we should endeavour to secure Prince Gbo's staff, as he is the senior officer of the customs, excepting those in the Whydah station; by this means we should pass along unmolested. I accordingly availed myself of the opportunity of securing this. It is three feet long, the head is carved exactly like a man's right hand held or stretched out. If a man hold out his right hand with his fingers stretched out he sees the staff to which I am alluding. I got to the next station early, about 9.30, for my carriers moved as fast as they could, and then waited for the rest of the carriers, who got to the station about eleven o'clock. My guide then delivered the staff to the officer of this station—a wild and hungry-looking fellow of about fifty years of age. This man became angry on seeing this staff, because it prevented him from perpetrating his intentions. Notwithstanding this, he insisted upon the opening of my boxes. My guide, who is one of them, and knows their uncivil behaviour, told me to open them. I refused, alluding to the staff for my security. He then went and ransacked my guide's boxes and other luggage, deprived him of all his provisions, &c., seized and took away five of my mats which were to have covered me in the canoe, and told my guide to tell me I must pay something. I was obliged to make him a present of some money, besides the things he had seized, ere I was permitted to proceed. Having secured a canoe and men, we left this station for Whydah at 12.30. This is one of the principal stations of the King of Dahomey, in which a Wesleyan Society had flourished for some time. We had a pleasant voyage all along; but at length our canoe unfortunately ran upon a stump and narrowly escaped being capsized. On the morning of the 29th inst. I engaged a man to take me upon his shoulders, and had to walk about two hours in water three or four feet deep along the way to Whydah. As this is a chief station, we of necessity called here and obtained permission, else we would not be permitted to proceed. After visiting several persons in the place, and viewing other parts of the country, in which I noticed its populated state, the prosperity of trade, the beauty of the country itself, as well as its fine buildings, I thought what a sad thing indeed it is that a country possessed of such resources has not a single church or chapel to adorn or complete its beauty! As my guide told me we should get to my station the next day, or the third day at the longest time, and being resolved to proceed to Aguay that evening, I asked him to proceed with me to the palace of Prince Dinadu, and obtained permission to go away and get to my station in time. Accordingly we proceeded. But a minute or two before we left, Mr. Buko, our landlord, mentioned that he heard it noised abroad that the English Government were sending men as spies to Whydah. I told him I had heard nothing of the kind. Before this time it appears a similar report had gone forth informing the Prince that there are spies in the land; and, as we were bound to see him before we left, he was prepared also to meet us. Our landlord accompanied us to the palace of the Prince, who seemed to be exceedingly angry at our presence, and manifested a feeling totally unfriendly at the onset. Mr. Buko, our spokesman, knelt down, clapped his hands together several times, told him our mission, and besought him to grant us permission to pass to Little Popo, where we expect to begin our work. He inquired of me, through the interpreter, "Why did not the Wesleyan Missionary Society build the chapel there before sending men to take possession of it?" I said to my guide that there had been a chapel not only there, but even in Whydah, as well as Augway, &c., but these had been broken up. But for the good of the people and the instruction of the children this Mission wishes to renew these societies, and for this cause they sent me. On hearing this he was exasperated, and ordered us to return immediately by the way we came, and inform him by whom we were sent, that we have no permission or authority to proceed thither. All along from Dahomey beyond Popo is under the King's jurisdiction. Our Superintendent must write a letter of inquiry to the King of Dahomey and the princes or chiefs about his kingdom, so that due consideration might be given to the subject. As I had suffered a little from ill health shortly before I undertook my journey this way, I pleaded to obtain permission to have my course through Popo, not far from Whydah, so that I might return by the mail packet to Lagos, as the way through which I came to Whydah is rather tedious. Here he said he would not hear from me a word more, but I should return immediately by the way I came. He then called out, and a wild-looking gentleman presented himself, knelt down before him, and clapped his hands together several times. Upon his person we observed scores of keys suspended about his neck and waist. This he did to frighten me away. This individual I conjecture to be the keeper of the doors of the prison. On seeing this I became thoroughly convinced and satisfied that evil was determined upon, and that danger was at hand if I persisted. I beckoned to my guide and landlord, the latter kneeling and clapping his hands several times: we then bowed and retired from the palace. On returning to our landlord's house, we found him much troubled about this matter. We had thought at first to pass the night in Whydah, as the day was far gone; but having now found that we were becoming obstacles in the way of our landlord, we thought it most prudent to retire. There are scores of towns and villages situated on either side of the river which I saw on my way to Whydah. Also from Lagos up to Porto Novo we find scores of towns and villages on either side of the river. — *Wesleyan Magazine.*

## The Dahoman government's use of captured Ayors in ceremonial roles, alongside the symbolic use of silk damask to challenge cultural norms, reflects a complex legal and moral system that both revered and feared authority, while also reversing power dynamics and challenging the narrative of Dahomey as a violent society.

The examination of the claim regarding the Dahoman government's use of captured Ayors in ceremonial roles and the symbolic use of silk damask reveals a nuanced perspective when combining insights from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not provide specific information on the ceremonial roles of captured Ayors or the symbolic use of silk damask, focusing instead on Dahomey's transition from the slave trade to palm oil production and the use of war captives as labor. It also lacks details on the legal and moral systems in the context of reversing power dynamics or challenging narratives of violence. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed accounts that align with the claim, describing a ceremony where twelve Ayor individuals carried silk damask and cotton shirting, symbolizing a reversal of power dynamics and challenging cultural norms. This act was intended to assert Dahomey's authority and celebrate the victory and independence achieved by the Dahoman king's father over the Ayors. The articles also highlight Dahomey's complex legal and moral system, where authority was both revered and feared, as evidenced by the ceremonial use of captured individuals and symbolic gestures of power. However, they also depict Dahomey as a society with violent practices, such as human sacrifices during the "Royal custom," which contrasts with the claim's suggestion of a narrative challenging Dahomey as a violent society. This duality underscores the complexity of Dahomey's legal and moral system, where authority and power dynamics were intricately woven into cultural and ceremonial practices.

* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.
Nevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Social change**: Artisans were denied the rights enjoyed by freemen and nobles, and were reduced to endogamy. While a noble could marry slave girls, he could not marry a blacksmith's daughter.$^{58}$ And yet, like the griot, whose verbal magic consolidated the power of the rulers and even gave him a very small share of it, the blacksmith was feared because of the magical nature of his work. He was also a mediator in conflicts between individuals and families. However, there was no shortage of subjects of tension. 59 In the Mossi kingdom of Wagadugu, slaves were made into eunuchs in sufficiently large numbers for it to be feasible to export them northward. In Asante, the quantity of human livestock obtained by the payment of tribute was so great that when the slave trade was abolished, the Asantehene stated that he could not feed the 20 000 captives whom he had on his hands, adding, 'unless I kill or sell them, they will grow strong and kill my people'. 60 It appears, however, that social relations between slaves and their owners were marked by less hostility in societies not having a central power structure. We are told that in the village of Pura, slaves were fed 'just like everyone else'. M. PŁre tells us that in the Lobi country, each submatriclan was divided into two groups: the true-born Weya, and the Dea, who were of captive origin. The latter category included people who had been adopted because they had been found at the door one morning, seeking refuge from famine or raiding. Both categories, however, were fully integrated within the social structure as sources of production and progeny. Accordingly, a slave lived in the same hut as his master, whom he addressed as 'father'; he was a member of the same kin group as the latter and was subject to the same rituals and taboos and engaged in the same work; his owner gave him a wife, he possessed a field, and was entitled to accumulate cowries to the point of buying his freedom or purchasing another man to replace him. What was required of him was that he remain in the same village as his master.$^{61}$ Here we see a clear indication of a deliberate policy of using slavery as a means of strengthening clan or territorial groups.
* **The collapse of Old Oyó**: The wars and their social effects culminated in the development of a new society; and this gave rise to the need to fashion new methods and styles of government. The new situation made for the emergence of warriors as the dominant class and the eclipsing of the pre-existing monarchical class. This is particularly true of the Yoruba area where the obas lost control to the baloguns or warlords. The experiments with military dictatorship in Ijaiye under Kurumi, federalism in Abeokuta under Sodeke and con› stitutional monarchy in Epe under Kosoko illustrate the efforts in nine› teenth-century Yorubaland to fashion new constitutions appropriate for the political management of the new society generated by the wars.$^{28}$ The eventual adoption in the twentieth century of the Yoruba-style gba-ship institution by some of the Aja communities within the Nigerian region exemplified the continuing nature of this cultural adaptation process. 29
* **Patterns of authority**: These two models were complementary, and in practice there were many kinds of intermediate situations, waverings and compromises. The realities of the environment and of economic activity, as well as historical circumstances and even personal considerations, determined whether the prevailing type of organization tended towards the mon- archical model, with its qualities of order and security, or towards the more flexible, less authoritarian democratic ideal. 24 It should be added that the state system was not always the most effective framework of order. Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples. In the case of the Aro, it was the widespread influence of a set of oracles, managed through a network of Aro colonies and local 'secret societies', that provided a judicial and economic basis of integration over a wide section of Igboland. Economic changes in the nineteenth century affected the pattern of authority not only in terms of the structures of the state systems, but often in strengthening such existing non-political integrative structures as well.
* **Some consequences of the d[ihads**: In general, traditional power and social standing were transferred to a new elite, the mudjahidun. Since the Fulbe had formed the backbone of the fighters, they tEus became the aristocrats par excellence of the Western Sudan. They filled most of the administrative positions, and many of them were settled on land alienated during the course of the djihäd. Fulbe and other landowners depended on slave labour to farm their agricultural holdings.$^{56}$ It seems that the proportion of slaves to freemen in the caliphates remained at the high level it had reached in pre-dßhäd days. Slaves who had participated in the djihâd were freed, but those who had not gone over to the shaykhs were re-enslaved. More slaves were secured in raids across frontiers and" in rebellions. The legal status of captured slaves was spelt out in œv&fatwa (legal opinion) of al-Maghïlî: As for one you find in their [unbelievers'] hands, as a slave, who claims to be a free-born Muslim, his word is to be accepted until proof is established to confirm that he is a slave ... Any person you leave from among them, because he claims that he is a free-born Muslim, then it becomes evident to you that he was unbeliever, enslave him again. 57 All individuals and groups within the caliphates were afforded protection and security. The southern movements of pastoral groups were regulated to minimize tension between them and the peasant communities. Northern frontiers and pastures were constantly watched to restrain Tuareg raids.
And slave-raiding within the communities was stopped. SkarTa courts were established and kädis (judges) were appointed by the caliphs and the amirs. Many un-Islamic practices were banned. For example prohibition on drinking of alcohol was strictly enforced; the hated taxes of the discredited regimes were replaced by the canonical zakät (tithe), kharadj (land tax), and djizya; the number of wives was restricted to four, etc.$^{3}$^ Taxes were allocated and collected by the amirs who, more often than not, levied them arbitrarily.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The political organization of Liptako represented an attempt to maintain a balance between the clans, and this was reflected in its very structures. Power was transmitted through patrilineal descent from Saidu, the father of that Brahima who had led the djihäd. However, the Ferrobe eventually decided or agreed that their antagonists, the Torodbe, should constitute the electoral college that designated the amir. The college investigated each candidate's personal qualities, such as justice and piety, as well as the services he had rendered, the extent of his matrimonial alliances, and the like, and finally gave a decision. By means of this participation, the Torodbe, even though they were debarred from wielding power themselves, were placed in a position where they could in a sense decide among the Ferrobe claimants, and this served to integrate them into the system. 43 Once the new amir had been tentatively selected, he was subjected to an interview and asked trick questions. Then animals were sacrificed to the genii and to a sacred snake. A new traditional drum was made, to be included among the symbols of power granted by the Sokoto council. 44 The new amir's head was swathed in a turban by one of the Torodbe in the presence of the chief imam and the kadi, and facing the standard he swore to respect the customs and principles of Islam and to maintain the welfare of his people. This was a ritual of political and religious renewal of cosmic dimensions, designed to appease supernatural forces of all descriptions. The religious authorities were appointed by the kadi of Dori and were invested with judicial power as courts of appeal. In addition, there was a network of village imams, headed by the chief imam of Dori.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: The mixing of ethnic and sub-ethnic groups resulted in considerable mutual exchange of ideas and material culture. We have already observed that the twentieth-century development that allowed the Aja in the area of the present-day Badagry local government area of Lagos State in Nigeria to adopt the Yoruba oba-ship institution must be traced to the nineteenthcentury and pre-nineteenth century migrations and resultant adoption of Yoruba institutions by the Aja. Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation. That such Benin cultural influence on the Yoruba has its demographic dimension is clearly reflected in traditions of Benin settlements in the Yoruba areas in question. The socio-political impact of Benin on other Edo-speaking peoples as well as the Itsekiri, the Urhobo, and the Isoko to the east and north of Benin has been much more systematically studied. 39 Above all, the nineteenth century witnessed the foundation of the modern settlement pattern in which location along or close to the coast conferred great advantages: witness, for example, the heightened status of Warri visà-vis Benin, Lagos vis-à-vis the rest of Yorubaland, Porto Novo, Whydah and, most spectacular of all, Cotonou on the Aja coast. The period also anticipated the new society of the later colonial and post-colonial period, characterized by a closer association, if not integration, within the Western European economy and culture.
* **Patterns of authority**: Kano and Bunafu thus represented two different models of the way in which the power structure affected agricultural development in Africa in the early nineteenth century, one where authority was centralized and structured, the other where it was diffuse and informal. This is not a distinction between 'state' and 'stateless' societies as anthropologists have earlier suggested. In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The local power structure was also designed to provide a place for the older Fulbe clans which could not aspire to the office of amir: the jooro (village headmen) were selected from the ranks of the heads of families of more ancient lineage. Jelgoji had a similar system for incorporating all clans within a single structure: the chief was elected by an electoral college made up of aged notables of SadaabØ descent, i.e. representatives of the people who had been dominant in the region before the arrival of the JelgobØ, whereas only a member of the latter could actually be chief. In practice, the chief was invariably a member of the Nyorgo family. The insignia of the office was a staff (symbolizing stock-breeding) hung with various kinds of agricultural products. Here again, the material prosperity of the new chiefs reign was secured by means of sacrifices carried out by the indigenous Kurumba.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance. In some cases, the Dyula community became thoroughly assimilated into the local community. Such instances of total assimilation were rare, but I. Wilks, in his informative study,$^{36}$ points to one example - the Tagara of Jirapa in north-western Ghana. The process was insidious enough. As already discussed in the case of the funeral rites of the Koumina canton, the Africans retained their custodianship of land, both physically and ritualistically, so that while, in the towns, contacts with the French and Islamic 'civilizing' missions, demonstrated undeniable advantage for the converts, the seasonal 'commuting' between land and city itself displaced 'unsecured' groups and individuals. Such was the fate of the Dyula.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: It would appear that basically contending interests penetrated the Western Sudan zone of West Africa during the colonial period, the colonial or European and the Muslim represented by the Dyula. The conditions for this resided in the social structure of the people of the Western Sudan. The traditional caste system of the Western Sudanese, which recognized the authority of skilled craft groups over the related materials and geographical territory of their craft and its practice, accorded to the iman or alim (Islamic intructor) a monopoly of authority over the province of literacy, writing and communication, and also indirectly over commercial relations that developed with European colonialism.
* **Popular reactions**: The Moroccan people were sensitive to more than these merely economic aspects: they resented as well, and perhaps above all, the decline in the authority of the kadi, the sultan and, in the last analysis, Islam itself. Each colonial power laid much stress on respect for its flag. If one of its citizens was killed, its consul cared little whether there had been provocation or whether it was intentional homicide or not; he demanded the execution of the guilty person (where this was uncertain, execution of all those present at the incident), monetary reparations to the victim's family, the dismissal of agents he considered insufficiently zealous in the matter, an official government apology, and protection for the flag. 39 Under conditions like these, officials did not know how to act. If they rejected the consul's complaints and the affair turned out badly for the sultan, they were the ones to suffer the consequences; on the other hand, if they agreed to flout custom, which left the decision in the hands of the central authority, and were diligent about the case and then the result was a popular uprising, they again bore the responsibility. Their prestige was constantly eroded, to the detriment of the public order that the Europeans claimed to need. 40 The kadi and muhtasib were particular victims of this situation contrary to the letter of sharTz. Hence their fierce opposition to protection. With Britain's active Tucking, the British Jew and philanthropist Sir Moses Montefiore visited Morocco following which Sultan Muhammad IV issued the dahir of 5 February 1864: it ordered Moroccan officials to treat Jews' affairs with speed and justice, threatening them with grave sanctions if they did not comply. 'As soon as the Jews had the dahir, they made copies of it which they distributed in all the towns; they acted together to make themselves independent of all authority, particularly that of the ports', says the historian al-Nâsirï.$^{41}$ The $^{ <}$ulama' saw this decree.as a blow aimed at sharTa and the reaction was so violent that Muhammad IV had to back 3öwn. Muslim proteges aroused even greater hostility. At the Friday prayers in the mosques the $^{ i}$ulama$^{>}$ presented numerous pamphlets urging the sultan to take severe reprisals against them. 'If you do not,' one of these $^{i}$ulama' said, 'doubt will
* **Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Ethiopia**: and 'symbolic'. The emperor personally led his army, managed imperial affairs, and dispensed justice and patronage. More importantly perhaps, the emperor symbolized national unity and independence by virtue of his alleged descent from the Biblical King Solomon and his coronation and anointment by the abuna, the Egyptian head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. 1 7 The imperial system inherited by Tewodros lacked a notable 'historic bureaucracy'.$^{18}$ Excepting comparatively few offices with well-defined functions like the Tsahafe Tezaz (Imperial Secretary) and the Afa-Negus (Chief Justice), the imperial administration was largely personalized in the emperor and his regional representatives: the governors and lords. 19 Tewodros himself attempted to create a bureaucracy by often replacing existing governors of aristocratic stock by paid army generals of humble birth, loyal to, and dependent on him. But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre. Both systems were solidly based on privilege at the core, and extensively utilized patronage and assimilation techniques. Nevertheless, whereas Ethiopia's imperial system was largely 'African', lacking political parties or parliament - Tewodros, Yohannes and Menelik became Emperor by virtue of their superior military power over their rivals, and not through the ballot box - Liberia's central government was thoroughly western. At any rate, each system possessed or developed the mechanisms and instruments necessary for containing European aggression unleashed by the Scramble and partition.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80**: In 1820 the Sokoto caliphate was composed of some seven major emirates with a further ten large emirates still in the process of formation. Borno too was re-established after the retreat from its capital and the loss of extensive areas in the west and south. In order to understand the changes implied by the terms 'caliphate' and 'emirate', let us briefly and very schematically recapitulate the old political system the reformers had replaced.
The most notable feature of the old system was the role of the king, known variously as mai, sarki, etsu, alafin. Before the shifts in power in the late eighteenth century, the king had ritual functions and a role that required a certain seclusion from the public; the palace was more sacred than a mere house. The king was more or less above politics, a symbol of great authority in whose name all acts were done; he represented the state. A number of men and women who as slaves or eunuchs were without kin or heirs were servants dedicated to the palace and the king's person; they formed one section of the administration. Another section was formed by large independent households with hereditary claims to titles, the holders of which thus had their own followings of men. A third section was the family of the king, particularly the king's mother or sister, his brothers and sons. The composition of councils and bodies responsible for rituals or for military leadership varied in detail from state to state, often with the palace slaves and the free office-holders divided into orders through which individuals could move by promotion. Political competition was limited to the offices under the king. As far as we know there were in the late eighteenth century trends for kings to take a more active part in politics, to become more exclusively Muslim and to promote reforms on the lines of Islamic government.$^{6}$ Economically, it seems that it was a period of rising levels of consumption (particularly of cotton cloth) and demand for slaves; and there was a need to regulate the expanding market and protect it. The effects of these changes reverberated down to the trading, farming and pastoral communities in the countryside, as those involved in political competition sought to strengthen their hold on their bases of power; as a consequence of which the ¿jihad found widespread support among the victims of these changes.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The western and southern Volta plateaux**: What Karamoko Moktar tried to do from southern Gwiriko, the Kene› dugu did from the north. They were a distant Kong offshoot under the TraorØ, a Joola-influenced, that is, Islamized, Senufo group which became organized in the eighteenth century around Sikasso. Between 1850 and i860, Laula founded the power of the TraorØ on the small Senufo chief› taincies. Their authority was to be confirmed from 1875 onwards by King Tieba, an ally of the French. After drawing closer to the Kiembagha of Korogho and victoriously repelling a siege laid by Samori against his strongly built fortress at Sikasso, Tieba too suffered defeat in 1890 at Sinematiali.
The peoples to the south-west of what is now Burkina Faso lived through this period under a similar climate of pressure, instability and conflict. Ethnic migrations were the rule in this region. The Pwa, Sissala, Gan, Dyan, Birifor, Dagara and Dagara-Joola followed, jostled and repelled one another, intermarried, gathered together and separated in this area, especially during the first decades of the nineteenth century.
Of course these were not human tidal waves.$^{36}$ M. PŁre, quoting her oral sources, mentions small groups, sometimes comprising several units, setting out as scouts 'to see if the place is good', to be joined by others on 'seeing that it was good'. The remarkable point here is that the closest family ties were maintained among these ethnic groups despite their diversity in the strictest sense of the term. For example, they all belonged to the four great matriarchies and bore matronymics.$^{37}$ They all spoke Voltaic languages that were frequently very close to each other. They had the same cultural, funerary, matrimonial and initiation customs, dispersed settlement patterns, similar social structures, identical agricultural methods (intensive on alluvial or domestic soils, extensive elsewhere), etc. Yet, there were enough differences in all these respects to make each group cling fiercely to its own identity.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure**: In the case of Katsina, the original, rather limited lineage-based cen› tralization gave way, in the face of militarism, to an increasingly autocratic palace government. These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.
So far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.
In larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi. The links between these representatives of the local population and the upper levels of the administration were in the hands ofjakadu, servants or agents of the office-holder allocated the responsibility for that section of the population. Similarly, messengers linked the office-holder to his amir. The function of the administration was primarily tax collection, but this was as much a political as an economic act; to pay was also a symbolic act of submission, to refuse payment was a token of rebellion. As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns. Some indication of the administrative work in the late nineteenth century has been preserved in the correspondence which has been kept by descendants of officials in Sokoto, Gombe and Bauchi.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80**: The Muslim reformers (who included at least one of the last, reforming Hausa kings) had a very different blueprint to institute. The role of the king was replaced by an amir neither whose person nor whose palace was sacred. Allah, and not the state personified by the king, was the source of authority. Consequently the amir was chosen not for any inherited quality of sacredness but for his personal piety towards Allah. The amir was the first among equals; his companions as a group were to share power under the amir's leadership. As a result, the role of palace slave-officials was to be reduced to that of personal servants and the formal office of queen mother or sister was eliminated. The amir was part of the political process, and his office was theoretically open to any suitably pious candidate. A minimal bureaucracy of ministers, judges, inspectors, police and imams was established as prescribed by the blueprint; and the regulations of the sharTa law, following the Mäliki school of interpretation, were to order relations between persons and between groups. The changes were designed to limit and formalize the political processes, to prevent gross manipulation of previously unwritten rules as well as to curtail the growth of palacecentred government. It was intended to do away with the ambiguity of a Muslim wielding ritual authority based on local, traditional religious belief, and replace it with an authority derived solely from Allah, an authority not only acceptable to the Muslim community but also accountable to it. The blueprint's detail is most conveniently set out by 'Abdullah dan Fodio in his book to guide the Kano community on their new constitution, Diyd" alhukkatn.$^{1}$ But as problems arose, Muhammad Bello and subsequent caliphs wrote letters to the various leaders of nascent communities, outlining the crucial elements of the new system and adding some practical details. From one viewpoint, the political and intellectual. history of the nineteenth century can be seen as an extended exercise in trying to implement or modify the reformers' blueprint. From another viewpoint (also implied in the blueprint), it is a history of the development and purposeful integration of the rural economies of the region, and their closer linking with first the Mediterranean and later the Atlantic economies. To these reformers' concerns, there was also added a distinctive sense of urgency and seriousness if the community was to be rebuilt, materially and spiritually, in time for the expected coming of the
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The western and southern Volta plateaux**: In this region, lineage groups and clans that for the most part lacked centralized power stood up rather well to the upheavals of the time. The area had witnessed for centuries the penetration of the Joola (Dyula) and the Marka who, through intermarriage with the indigenous peoples, had evolved new cultural, social and economic groups, one prototype being the Bobo-Joola people. A purely theoretical line should not, however, be drawn between peoples with centralized power and the others. In fact, centralization can take non-political forms, such as the poro society of the Senufo, a very large-scale religious community that determined social hierarchy. It is therefore in no way surprising that peoples with little political hierarchy should have weathered the turmoil of the nineteenth century differently from societies with more elaborate political structures. Such observations help us to understand the turbulent history of the Voltaic groups in this region during the nineteenth-century: invasions, preventive attacks, resistance, adaptation and intermarriage. Generally, while more or less vigorously rejecting attempts at domination on the part of the Mande, Mossi, Zerma, Marka and Fulbe groups, the more sedentary, indigenous peoples became used to their presence and economic activity, moving when political pressure or economic exaction became too great. We can only give a few examples here.
* **Political structures**: Khedive Ismail revived and advanced this spirit of reform, employing Europeans to supervise abolitionist and commercial ventures in the Sudan, completing the cutting of the Suez Canal and constructing other canals and irrigation works, railways, communication systems and the like. His aim was, within the limitations of Ottoman overlordship, which European powers exploited to impose unfair treaties to entrench their interests, to buy European technology to modernize Egyptian structures and institutions. 11 Ostensibly, the aim of the djiKäi movements was to recreate classical Islamic institutions of the time of the orthodox caliphs. In more practical io. See Chapter 15, above. See above R. A. Caulk, 1972. terms, it was to create Islamic theocratic states in place of traditional societies ruled by Muslims and traditionalists. It was to instal rulers chosen for their learning and piety and dedicated to running the affairs of the state on the principles of the Ku'ran and Islamic laws, and committed to establishing truly Islamic institutions. By the 1870s, the successors of the founders in Sokoto had achieved a fair measure of success. Under the overall supervision of the caliph, the individual amirs had certainly achieved more durable political structures than the Hausa rulers they had displaced. It is true that in many respects the rulers and the aristocratic classes around them had re-absorbed many of the Hausa nobility and privileges of fiefholders and merchant princes. However, the relative degree of peace that the caliphate enjoyed, the attention to markets, industries, crafts and trade routes, the power of judges and other officials and the control of amirs over the officials, all ensured a higher degree of executive authority in the state.
* **Borno, 1820-80 > The second period, 1855-80: the Borno Shaykhdom**: If this analysis of Borno politics in terms of patron-clientage is correct (and it is the analysis of R. Cohen and L. Brenner), such a system had its origins in al-Kânâmrs use of slaves and a few friends to run his early administration.$^{31}$ Because of the country's divided loyalty, with the older lineages probably following the mat, the Shaykh^ did not take over a hereditary administration; and the deaths of äEtCänärnfs councillors in the disorders of 1846-54 cut short any development in that direction. Members of the man's administration too were discredited after 1846. It is difficult to see, then, what other form of political recruitment Shaykh 'Umar could have used at the time. It may however be an anachronism to treat patronclientage as the traditional Borno system, or even as the dominant system in the early nineteenth century. Al-Känämfs councillors primarily were not his clients but his partners, with a considerable degree of inde› pendence - thus their crucial role in the events following al-Känämfs death. Ministerial dynasties were then still a possible development. I would suggest, after all, that there was a marked political change after the period 1845-55,$^{ Dut on}$e made easier by simply extending over the whole political spectrum the principle al-Kânâmï used in his appointment of slave officials.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In about a week after this he started for Kanna, one of his chief towns, about eight miles east of Abomey, where he has a large palace. Here he fixed a day for the commemoration of the victory gained by his late father over the Ayors, to whom the Dahomians were tributary.

He sent out another expedition from this, and they brought 140 slaves, and were treated as stated above.

On the 30th June the first custom, or the commemoration of the victory over the Ayors, was held. It was the last annual custom with his father; but he, wishing to have things changed to his own fashion, began with this.

The first thing was, that the King came to a large yard in the palace, where big umbrellas were fixed; under them he laid himself on a couch, surrounded by the Amazons, then singers of both sexes began their work, one after the other, singing all the strong names they could imagine. It will be tedious to mention all the ceremonies; but on July the 2nd, which was a day only for the chiefs to hear the singers in their respective places, the King came out unexpectedly, having before him twelve Ayor people, holding in their hands a piece of silk damask and one piece of cotton shirting, went round the market three times, then came and sat himself about ten feet from where I was sitting, looking on the dancing and hearing the singing, and called audience, and told the reasons of what he had done; and that was, the former kings served the Nago Ayors, and paid heavy tribute yearly, and that those who were sent to collect the tribute were such extortioners, that they would claim nothing but silk damask and that kind of shirting. Such treatment all the former kings underwent, except his late father, who would not submit; he therefore turned to and fought them, and became conqueror over them. Those of them he caught he killed, and with their blood mixed mud and built the beasts' house in the palace of Kanna; and that market where he was sitting being the very place where the collectors had to meet to receive their meals from the chiefs of Dahomey, he could do nothing better to show the happiness and privilege which his father had bequeathed to him, than making twelve of the sons of Ayor bear in their hands the cloth as mentioned above, that they may relate to their ancestors, in the other world,
* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: the change which his father had made. Here he called some of his captains, and gave them about two fathoms each of the silk damask, and explained that he did this because the Ayors would not allow silk damask to be worn at Kanna. Now the Ayors holding the cloths shall have to tell their fathers in the other world that it is not only worn to cover their nakedness, but to sweep ground with. The captains who received it wore it in such a way as to sweep the ground, and walked about where the twelve poor fellows were standing, having some of the skulls of their ancestors in a large brass pan before them. The poor fellows did not know that they were to be killed until now; and how they did look and tremble! Who could rescue them from the lion's mouth? We shall soon see their fate. The speech was then turned against the Abbeokutans and the English people who resided there.
* **Gold Coast**: Sir,—It is with great pleasure that I now open a correspondence with your valuable society. I may safely venture to say that there is no person on the Gold Coast who has hailed the advent of your periodical, the African Times, with more satisfaction and hope than I have done. I only regret that it was not diffusing its light and striking its redoubtable blows at political and moral corruption on the Gold Coast a few years earlier. It would have prevented much injustice, and saved the British name from many a blot, which has greatly damaged its prestige among the tribes of Western Africa, and made the very name of good old England a laughing-stock to the foreigner—the Dutch, the French, and the American traders on the coast.

With regard to Dahomey—respecting which my long and intimate knowledge of the country, the King, the chiefs and people, entitle, I think, my opinion to some weight—I beg to urge that the cause of humanity demands the utmost efforts of every one who is interested in the moral regeneration of Pagan Africa.

I hope we may shortly hear that Commodore Wilmot has succeeded in his enterprise, and that by peaceful measures the dangers impending over Abeokuta will be averted; and that, by judicious instructions furnished to the King and his chiefs by agencies from England, Dahomey may become that magnificent cotton field for which its soil and other capabilities give it such a peculiar adaptation.

I have anxiously watched, from month to month, the progress of public opinion in England relative to the most suitable policy for meeting the Dahoman difficulty; and I have been very glad indeed to observe the prevalence of a tendency to pacific measures.

I should deprecate any hostile movement against Dahomey, until all pacific means are utterly exhausted. The masses of the people in Dahomey are an agricultural people; and there is more cultivation of the soil in Dahomey than there is in Ashantee, or, I may say, in almost any other country westward of that state between Whydah and Apollonia. The Dahomans are warriors, in favour of the slave-trade, from a necessity arising out of the despotism of their Government so impelling them; but strange as it may seem, they have a peculiar genius for agriculture, and could, I think, be easily led into the working out of a great national scheme for cotton cultivation. But any such scheme must be well-conceived, and carried out with vigour, in extensive detail.

I would warn all parties interested against any half measures in reference to Dahomey—be they either for peace or war. Whatever is done should, to secure success, be done on an extensive and imposing scale. The Dahoman people can only be acted upon through their Government—a Government which, however much it may be feared by them, is also deeply venerated.
* **FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.**: Among the passengers on board the mail steamer Lagos, which arrived at Liverpool from the West Coast of Africa early in November, are the Dahomeyan envoys, sent by King Behanzin to confer with the French Government, with a view to peace. The party includes the king's great chiefs, Chedingar and Ayumkuken; his messenger, Tassah; Mr. Henry Dasos, an interpreter, and Mr. John P. Jackson, editor of *The Lagos Record*. The chiefs stoutly deny that the King of Dahomey is the inhuman monster he has been represented to be. They affirm that no human sacrifices are offered in Dahomey, except at the annual "Royal custom," which, however, has been suspended for the past four years. At this custom all the royal maidens are required to fetch water from the sacred streams of Golutar. This water is sprinkled in the royal mausoleum, after which sacrifices of sheep and oxen are made by the fetish priest, followed by a human sacrifice, the victim being commissioned to convey messages to the spirits of the deceased kings, and to invoke their guidance and protection for the throne and kingdom. The chiefs, in support of the foregoing, assert that of the 4,000 Yorubas captured in the last raid at Abeokuta four years ago, not one has been offered in sacrifice, and that it is a capital offence to shed human blood in Dahomey, and also that any chief or prince who would cause one of his servants to be beaten so that he fainted would be imprisoned for life. The chiefs were well pleased with the treatment and comfort they received on the voyage to England, and what they saw in the Liverpool streets and docks caused them great surprise.

These envoys took 21 days to get from Dahomey to Lagos on account of their adopting a circuitous route in order to avoid the French troops who are now operating in Dahomey. The Chief Chedingar takes to France the staff of King Behanzin, which is entirely made of silver, and represents the head of the sacred shark of Dahomey. This is the first time that this staff has ever left the country, and this is also the first occasion on which Dahomeyans have left Africa to treat with a civilised nation.

The envoys are represented to have declared that the King maintains that General Dodds deceived him, and he was

## The construction of royal monuments in Dahomey using human blood symbolized the intertwining of ritualistic violence, political power, and the subjugation of enemies, reflecting broader practices of using ancestral trophies in political and spiritual negotiations in African societies.

The claim that the construction of royal monuments in Dahomey using human blood symbolized the intertwining of ritualistic violence, political power, and the subjugation of enemies is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences in focus. The General History of Africa does not specifically address the use of human blood in Dahomey's royal monuments, nor does it explicitly discuss the intertwining of ritualistic violence and political power in this context. However, it does explore themes of ritual power, political authority, and the use of violence in various African societies, highlighting the role of religious symbols and rituals in legitimizing rulers and defending sovereignty, as well as the integration of religious and political authority. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed accounts supporting the claim, describing the practice of constructing a "Beadshouse" over the graves of deceased kings in Dahomey, where the mud for the walls is mixed with human blood, often from enemies. This practice symbolizes the intertwining of ritualistic violence and political power, reflecting the subjugation of enemies and the use of their blood in these monuments. The articles emphasize the political significance of these rituals, linking them to the king's military successes and the broader practice of using ancestral trophies in political and spiritual negotiations. While the articles do not explicitly mention ancestral trophies in political negotiations, they provide substantial evidence supporting the claim, with minor differences in the specific details compared to the broader themes discussed in the textbook.

* **Society and power in Central Africa (c. 1800-80)**: In addition to these material factors, however, there existed ritual aspects of power, represented by insignia and charms against enemies both within and without. How did the exercise of ritual and mystical power develop at a time of rapid reversals in the military and economic fortunes of these societies? Until historians have turned their attention to this question, our understanding of the history of the region must remain incomplete and confined within terms of reference that fail to reflect the deep aspirations of the ancient societies of Central Africa.
* **Political structures**: This effort at self-development was perhaps most prominent in the realm of political structures and state power. The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3
* **The role of religious ideas**: Meanwhile historians have been re-examining the role of religious ideas in the resistances. What they have found bears little resemblance either to the 'fanatical witch-doctors' of colonial reports, or to 'the magic of despair'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that 'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for "primary resistances" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. 'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the 'high priestess' was dismissed and executed. 'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west. Some› times it happened because of the influence of Christian ideas - and Hendrik Wittboi drew upon Protestant Christianity for his doctrine of sovereignty, while an African independent Christian prophet was active among the Nama at the time of their rising against the Germans. Very often it happened in the context of African religion.
* **The Cross river basin > The Ekpe society and the Bloodmen**: The Ekpe society of Calabar was an adaptation of a cult of the leopard present among many forest groups in the Cross river valley and in parts of the Cameroon. It was played as a masquerade by the young men, wearing hooded raffia costumes, while women and non-members shut themselves up in their houses. But the main function of the members was to hold weekly meetings at which social questions were discussed.
The Ekpe society, which, in the hinterland village communities, com› prised all elders, became an exclusive secret organization in the large commercial community of Calabar. It also became increasingly stratified into grades, rising from five recorded in 1828 to ten in 1840 and eleven in Ekpe was the effective law-making and enforcing authority in Calabar in the nineteenth century, and was utilized for the purpose by the foreign visitors as well. Thus, in 1850, the missionaries, supercargoes, and consul pressed the leaders of Calabar to enact an Ekpe law against human sacrifice at the deaths of rulers. Ekpe may be considered to have been an asset in the political system of Calabar in that it united all the free men of wealth and influence in a common organization. But its discrimination against the large body of men of slave origin and the poor led to the social disturbances of the mid-nineteenth century, which Dike has referred to as slave revolts.
The association of plantation slaves known as the Bloodmen came into being specifically as a pressure group to prevent the sacrifice of slaves at the deaths of kings and lineage heads. Such an organization of slaves on a blood oath was possible in Calabar because of their concentration in plantations, and because of the common disabilities they suffered. However, the association did not become a revolt for the emancipation of slaves, or even for the seizure of political power from the Ekpe. All the association achieved was to come into Calabar from the plantations in a body each time a notable man was ill or died, and there was danger of slaves being sacrificed or made to take poison ordeal. Their agitation led to the 1850-1 Ekpe law against human sacrifice, and King Archibong I considered it necessary to secure their support in the faction fights over the office of obong.
* **Political structures**: Notable examples of this tendency were the initial impact of the Mfecane, and the impact of trade and the Chokwe and Ovimbundu expansion on the Luba and Lunda state systems.$^{4}$ Several states and empires disappeared. And yet even more noticeable were the many new centres of power that emerged, experimenting with new administrative structures, generally tending towards a more effective exercise of power by the ruler, clearer definition of his jurisdiction, greater control of officials who owed their positions to his favour rather than their own hereditary rights, improved tax systems and the like. 5
Some historians have described these reformist movements as the activi› ties of African 'proto-nationalists and empire builders' engaged in a kind of African Scramble which in part provoked, or at least helps to explain, the European Scramble.$^{6}$ In fact, these reformist activities were not a sudden or fitful movement in any way comparable with the European Scramble. The search for more stable political structures had been going on throughout the nineteenth century and indeed before then as part of the general evolution of the peoples. Perhaps there was a quickening of the pace, and changes hitherto associated with the rise of states like Old Oyo in the seventeenth century or Asante, Dahomey, Futa Jallon, Futa Toro and Bondu in the eighteenth century became more general in the nineteenth century. Certainly there seems to have been a more determined effort to institutionalize political change in more permanent structures sustained by new military, social and economic systems.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Traditional African religion in the pre-colonial period**: In addition to these supernatural entities, there were other spirits or mystical powers which were recognized and reckoned with for their ability to aid or harm human beings. Included in these were agents of witchcraft, magic and sorcery. Finally, there were charms, amulets and talismans which were used for protective as well as offensive purposes.
The general conception of man was that he was a compound of immaterial and material substance. The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities. Human society was an unbroken family made up of the dead, the living and the yet unborn.
With regard to man's relation to society, being human meant belonging to a community and that involved participating in the beliefs, ceremonies, rituals and festivals ofthat community$^{2}$ and membership of the community was emphasized more than a member's individuality. For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife. An individual did not stay in one stage of existence for ever; he necessarily moved on to the next, and in order to make the transition smooth, special rites were performed to ensure that no breaks occurred, and movement and regeneration continued perpetually. 3
African traditional religion was not only pervasive, it also bound men to the unseen powers and helped them to form correct relations with the non-human powers; it also bound men to their fellow human beings.
Religion acted as the cement which held societies together, providing them with support and stability. Furthermore, traditional religion helped men to understand and control events, to relieve doubt, anxiety and guilt.
* **Patterns of authority**: Kano and Bunafu thus represented two different models of the way in which the power structure affected agricultural development in Africa in the early nineteenth century, one where authority was centralized and structured, the other where it was diffuse and informal. This is not a distinction between 'state' and 'stateless' societies as anthropologists have earlier suggested. In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables.
* **Change and continuity**: Nor is the 'traditional-modern' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku'ranic and Western schools.
Thus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant 'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of "civilization" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as 'enthusiastically and successfully' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting 'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives'$^{3}$ available to them.
* ****: A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination. What was true in 1976 can be seen as having been even more commonplace in that more dramatic period of external domina› tion in Africa, when an entire people, its social organizations, and its economic and artistic patterns became subjugated to strategies for maximum exploitation by outside interests. The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word. The Arabic dimension was unique in its own right, an ambivalent face of expansionism which none the less left strong cultural impressions on the landscape. Yet the reality that we extract from that period is the resilience and even increased vitality of the forms and values of the authentic cultures of the peoples.
* **African traditional religion and colonial rule**: Africans used their religion as a weapon to resist colonial rule and its threat to their values, and often relied on magic and the intervention of their ancestors and gods in their fight against colonial oppression. In the first two decades of this century, the Igbo warriors of south-eastern Nigeria resorted to such means to defend themselves from alien invaders. The Esza people of Abakaliki Division, the Uzuakoli and the Aro may be cited as examples.$^{6}$ Some cults were clearly a focus for resistance to colonial rule, such as the Mwari in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), or secret associations like the Poro in Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa. War-charm movements also occurred in Madagascar and the Congo basin. In East Africa, especially Kenya, African prophets arose to provide spiritual reinvigoration$^{7}$ to resist colonialism, such as occurred in the Machakos District among the people of Kilungu in the early months of 1922 (see Chapter 26). One of the best-known movements which used both religion and magic to resist colonial rule and oppression was the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa during the first decade of the twen› tieth century.$^{8}$ (See Fig. 7.1.) Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities. Besides, the movement provided the seed for African nationalism which was later to germinate and blossom into the struggle for independ› ence and its final achievement in the 1960s.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Social change**: Artisans were denied the rights enjoyed by freemen and nobles, and were reduced to endogamy. While a noble could marry slave girls, he could not marry a blacksmith's daughter.$^{58}$ And yet, like the griot, whose verbal magic consolidated the power of the rulers and even gave him a very small share of it, the blacksmith was feared because of the magical nature of his work. He was also a mediator in conflicts between individuals and families. However, there was no shortage of subjects of tension. 59 In the Mossi kingdom of Wagadugu, slaves were made into eunuchs in sufficiently large numbers for it to be feasible to export them northward. In Asante, the quantity of human livestock obtained by the payment of tribute was so great that when the slave trade was abolished, the Asantehene stated that he could not feed the 20 000 captives whom he had on his hands, adding, 'unless I kill or sell them, they will grow strong and kill my people'. 60 It appears, however, that social relations between slaves and their owners were marked by less hostility in societies not having a central power structure. We are told that in the village of Pura, slaves were fed 'just like everyone else'. M. PŁre tells us that in the Lobi country, each submatriclan was divided into two groups: the true-born Weya, and the Dea, who were of captive origin. The latter category included people who had been adopted because they had been found at the door one morning, seeking refuge from famine or raiding. Both categories, however, were fully integrated within the social structure as sources of production and progeny. Accordingly, a slave lived in the same hut as his master, whom he addressed as 'father'; he was a member of the same kin group as the latter and was subject to the same rituals and taboos and engaged in the same work; his owner gave him a wife, he possessed a field, and was entitled to accumulate cowries to the point of buying his freedom or purchasing another man to replace him. What was required of him was that he remain in the same village as his master.$^{61}$ Here we see a clear indication of a deliberate policy of using slavery as a means of strengthening clan or territorial groups.
* **The ideology of resistance**: some long-established peoples took their own advantage of the opportunities offered by nineteenth-century weapons and commerce to develop an arbitrary power, with the result that they could not count on popular support in a confrontation with the whites. This partly accounts for the ineffectiveness of resistance in Northern Rhodesia, where the Bemba chiefs faced what Henry S. Meebelo has called 'a popular revulsion against the ruling class', and where the aristocracy of Barotseland feared a slave uprising if they attempted to oppose the extension of British influence. ' 8 A number of historians, indeed, have stressed the importance of dis› criminating between resistances which were motivated by the desire of a ruling group to retain its exploitative power, and resistances on a much wider scale, which were often directed as much against the authoritarianism of African rulers as against colonial oppression. Edward Steinhart urges that protest and resistance can be and are directed ... against domestic forms of oppression ... Protest must be viewed as something other than the expression of national aspirations ... by focusing on leader› ship we have accepted the interpretation of anti-colonialism as 'African nationalism', a movement to expel aliens and to restore 'national' independence. If instead we look within the protest movements ... we are apt to discover that the impulses which the leaders organize and interpret are profoundly anti-authoritarian and revolutionary rather than anti-foreign and 'nationalist'. 19 Even where a long-established polity enjoyed a leadership with recog› nized legitimacy and was able to mobilize the majority of its population into resistance, recent historians have been inclined to criticize 'the narrow sense of primordial loyalty' and the 'parochialism' which did no more than to focus on sovereignty as previously understood. Such historians have emphasized instead the significance of those resistances in which the idea of sovereignty was redefined. Thus Isaacman argues that the 1917 revolt in the Zambezi valley was unlike previous resistances there, 'which were designed to regain the independence of a historical polity or a group of related peoples'. The 1917 revolt 'sought to liberate all the peoples of the Zambezi from colonial oppression', appealing especially to the oppressed peasantry of whatever ethnicity. 'The shift in primordial loyalties repre› sented a new level of political consciousness in which the Portuguese were perceived for the first time as the common oppressor.' 20
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The political organization of Liptako represented an attempt to maintain a balance between the clans, and this was reflected in its very structures. Power was transmitted through patrilineal descent from Saidu, the father of that Brahima who had led the djihäd. However, the Ferrobe eventually decided or agreed that their antagonists, the Torodbe, should constitute the electoral college that designated the amir. The college investigated each candidate's personal qualities, such as justice and piety, as well as the services he had rendered, the extent of his matrimonial alliances, and the like, and finally gave a decision. By means of this participation, the Torodbe, even though they were debarred from wielding power themselves, were placed in a position where they could in a sense decide among the Ferrobe claimants, and this served to integrate them into the system. 43 Once the new amir had been tentatively selected, he was subjected to an interview and asked trick questions. Then animals were sacrificed to the genii and to a sacred snake. A new traditional drum was made, to be included among the symbols of power granted by the Sokoto council. 44 The new amir's head was swathed in a turban by one of the Torodbe in the presence of the chief imam and the kadi, and facing the standard he swore to respect the customs and principles of Islam and to maintain the welfare of his people. This was a ritual of political and religious renewal of cosmic dimensions, designed to appease supernatural forces of all descriptions. The religious authorities were appointed by the kadi of Dori and were invested with judicial power as courts of appeal. In addition, there was a network of village imams, headed by the chief imam of Dori.
* **Growth of inequalities and tension**: It is clear that, during the nineteenth century, resistance to organized political authority often meant enhancing, sometimes for only a short period, the authority of religious institutions. This tended to reinforce opposition between religious and political authority here and there across the Lakes region. The small community organized around the possessed child Womunafu in the Bunafu area of Busoga in the nineteenth century is an example of such opposition, or competition, among different com› plexes of authority. In Bunafu, the enclosure of Womunafu was for several decades outside of, and opposed to, the political world around. Yet, the ideas and institutions upon which Womunafu's authority was based were extensively shared by the political capitals nearby.$^{32}$ In Bushu, in the western part of the region, the competition between religious and political bases of authority was, to a considerable extent, resolved in the nineteenth century through the integration of opposed elements into a collection of ritual chiefships.$^{33}$ In Rwanda, in Bunyoro, and in south-western presentday Uganda, kubandwa ideas and organization had long provided complexes of opposition to the authority of political capitals, a critically important plane opposed to the principles and activities of the state and from which the penetration of the state was substantially excluded. At times, kubandwa organizations were sufficiently strong to challenge and overthrow existing political authority. In the nineteenth century, perhaps the most substantial of all known kubandwa movements focused on the female deity Nyabingi. The Nyabingi movement emerged in opposition to the Rwanda state, which was formalizing its influence beyond the old administrative region in the Rwanda centre, particularly extending to the north and to the west. In the present-day Zaire-Uganda borderland, in Kigezi, and in parts of Nkore, followers of Nyabingi organized resistance to the extension of the Rwanda state into their worlds. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Nyabingi became a focus of resistance to political authority more generally and to European colonial activity as it was felt by peoples of the region. 34
* **Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies**: Mirambo's method of control in his 'empire' was based on the imposition of military power on the traditional system..Conquered rulers were required to acknowledge his over-rule by occasionally sending him tributes of ivory and young men for his army. Where there was resistance from a traditional ruler, Mirambo removed him and replaced him with a more submissive member of the same ruling family. Where a conquered province was near a powerful kingdom, Mirambo kept armed men of his own there. But his main method of control was that of keeping his army constantly on the move to intimidate both his neighbours and his subjects.
Nyungu ya Mawe's 'empire' was better integrated than that of Mirambo. Nyungu ya Mawe, like Mirambo, used the ruga-ruga to establish himself among the Kimbu. Between 1870 and 1880 he campaigned from his base in Kiwele and gained control of the trade route to the coast east of Tabora and the southbound route from Tabora to Ufipa and Lake Tanganyika. Among the conquered states Nyungu posted his own officials called vatwale, who were directly responsible to him. In his 'empire' the real rulers were no longer the traditional chiefs but the appointed vatwale. It was the duty of these officials to collect and forward to Nyungu all the ivory obtained in the kingdom. The area under each appointed official consisted of a number of traditional states. Therefore the Kimbu traditional states, num› bering about thirty, were ruled by about six or seven vatwale. 11 Mirambo and Nyungu ya Mawe were contemporaries. Both built up polities based on the changed material conditions of the late nineteenth century. Both Nyungu and Mirambo died in 1884. Because Nyungu made innovations in the administrative structure of his 'empire', when he died it survived until it was dismantled by the colonialists. On the other hand, Mirambo's 'empire' broke up into its constituent states simply because there was no successor who could maintain the strong army required to keep it together.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance. In some cases, the Dyula community became thoroughly assimilated into the local community. Such instances of total assimilation were rare, but I. Wilks, in his informative study,$^{36}$ points to one example - the Tagara of Jirapa in north-western Ghana. The process was insidious enough. As already discussed in the case of the funeral rites of the Koumina canton, the Africans retained their custodianship of land, both physically and ritualistically, so that while, in the towns, contacts with the French and Islamic 'civilizing' missions, demonstrated undeniable advantage for the converts, the seasonal 'commuting' between land and city itself displaced 'unsecured' groups and individuals. Such was the fate of the Dyula.
* **Religious protest movements**: Not so easy to suppress was the Mumbo cult, a movement contempor› aneous with Ndonye wa Kauti's prophetism which outlasted Ndonye. This movement was rooted in the resentment of colonial authority which the Luo and the Abagusii shared. This resentment dated back to the wars of occupation the British had inflicted on the Abagusii in 1904 and 1908, and on the Luo of Alego in 1908-1 o.$^{7}$ But it was further ingrained because of the British coercion of these people to yield compulsory labour for road construction and for the settler farms. There was, in addition, the hated hut tax which weighed particularly heavily on those who were polygamous. The paternalism of the missionaries further fuelled this mood of resent› ment. As in Ukambani, the Abagusii began to look for new categories of thought that would hold forth promise for a better world view. They found this in the Luo Mumbo cult, a traditional lake spirit cult which was at the height of its influence in the nineteenth century. This cult found revitalization into a political movement for resistance to the white man's presence in the second decade of this century. In an epiphany in 1913 this Mumbo spirit addressed one Onyango Dunde of the Seje clan in Alego as follows: I have chosen you to be my mouth-piece. Go out and tell all Africans - and more especially the people of Alego that from henceforth I am their God. Those whom I choose personally and also who acknowledge me will be forever in plenty. Their crops will grow of themselves, and there will be no more need to work. I will cause cattle, sheep and goats to come out of the lake in great numbers to those who believe in me, but all unbelievers and their families and cattle will die out.
The Christian religion is rotten and so is its practice of making its believers wear clothes. My followers must let their hair grow and never wash. All Europeans are your enemies but the time is shortly coming when they will disappear from our country.
* ****: The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions. It was also a cultural imposition and it used culture to buttress the political, economic and social superstructure which colonial› ism represented. It is the religious aspect of this cultural imposition of colonialism and the African response to it that this chapter deals with.
* **The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean**: A feature of this syncretism was observance of Catholic feast days and saints' days, together with recourse to the orixas and to voodoo. Thus, the feast days of the gods coincided with the dates of the Catholic saints' days. Bastide asserts that syncretism is no more than a white mask for Negro gods. The values of the two religions interpenetrate in varying degrees. In Brazil, for instance, a series of Catholic sacraments, such as baptism, are repeated not only for ritualistic purposes but also to give the individual additional strength. This acculturation of values of European origin marks even the forms closest to the African sources, such as candomblØ, macumba and other cults, some of which are close to, or even characterized by, magic. In the case oimacumba, attention should be drawn to the presence of Amerindian values, the acculturation here being of a threefold variety.
Examples of syncretism involving Amerindian culture can be seen in the West Indies, particularly in Honduras, where a mestizo people has emerged as the result of interbreeding between Amerindian women and Africans referred to as black Caribs.$^{73}$ These Africans were the descendants of the Igbo and Efik and, subsequently, of the Fante, Asante, Fon and Congo.
The 'African societies' gradually turned into 'black societies', varying in the strength of their connection with Africa and in their integration in society as a whole, in the sense of gaining full citizenship.
From the social standpoint, integration in society as a whole was keyed to the following variables: the type of society of the white colonizer; the form of land exploration; the religion of the colonizer - Protestant or Catholic; the percentage of Amerindians in the population and the degree of integration in the economic process imposed by the regime of the colonizer, either during the colonial period proper or following the attain› ment of independence by the Americas.
* **The abolitionist period**: But since the plantation complex varied throughout the Americas the socializing forces within which the Africans and their descendants would mould their own American culture likewise varied. Throughout the Amer› icas, therefore, the amalgam of cultures would demonstrate great variety.
Certainly this can be seen in the modifications which took place in the worship of Shango, perhaps the most widely distributed African religious form in the New World.$^{47}$ While the Nigerian - more specifically, the Yoruba - origin was never in doubt, the forms of Shango varied con› siderably from Cuba, to Trinidad, to Haiti, to Brazil. In Cuba, in particular, the cult became quite Catholicized, and the originally male African Shango became female, while other forms of the ritual as well as the symbols were transposed and, in some cases, transformed. What held true for the worship of Shango also followed in other aspects of community life and organization. It became increasingly more difficult for creóle Africans to maintain their original social forms in the New World, however great their numbers, owing to the development of a structure which had stabilized by the nineteenth century, and to which they were forced to become a part, and to make necessary adaption.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In about a week after this he started for Kanna, one of his chief towns, about eight miles east of Abomey, where he has a large palace. Here he fixed a day for the commemoration of the victory gained by his late father over the Ayors, to whom the Dahomians were tributary.

He sent out another expedition from this, and they brought 140 slaves, and were treated as stated above.

On the 30th June the first custom, or the commemoration of the victory over the Ayors, was held. It was the last annual custom with his father; but he, wishing to have things changed to his own fashion, began with this.

The first thing was, that the King came to a large yard in the palace, where big umbrellas were fixed; under them he laid himself on a couch, surrounded by the Amazons, then singers of both sexes began their work, one after the other, singing all the strong names they could imagine. It will be tedious to mention all the ceremonies; but on July the 2nd, which was a day only for the chiefs to hear the singers in their respective places, the King came out unexpectedly, having before him twelve Ayor people, holding in their hands a piece of silk damask and one piece of cotton shirting, went round the market three times, then came and sat himself about ten feet from where I was sitting, looking on the dancing and hearing the singing, and called audience, and told the reasons of what he had done; and that was, the former kings served the Nago Ayors, and paid heavy tribute yearly, and that those who were sent to collect the tribute were such extortioners, that they would claim nothing but silk damask and that kind of shirting. Such treatment all the former kings underwent, except his late father, who would not submit; he therefore turned to and fought them, and became conqueror over them. Those of them he caught he killed, and with their blood mixed mud and built the beasts' house in the palace of Kanna; and that market where he was sitting being the very place where the collectors had to meet to receive their meals from the chiefs of Dahomey, he could do nothing better to show the happiness and privilege which his father had bequeathed to him, than making twelve of the sons of Ayor bear in their hands the cloth as mentioned above, that they may relate to their ancestors, in the other world,
* **CAPE COAST.**: 

At the time that the Ashantees invaded these Protected Territories last year, Quacoe Duah, King of Ashantee, sent messengers to Darko Yaw with several presents, including a gold ammunition pouch and 200 oz. of gold dust, as an inducement for him to secede with his people from the alliance formed between himself and the other chiefs of the Accra or Eastern District, and come over to his side and assist his troops in the invasion of the Coast by the eastern route. These facts were at the time only suspected, but within the last few days they became matters of certainty. It appears that the King of Ashantee had arranged with Darko Yaw to come over to his side with all his chiefs and people, and in case the latter should decline to join, Quacoe Duah promised to send a small but efficient force to escort Darko Yaw and his immediate adherents within the Ashantee lines; after which a larger army was to proceed without delay to reduce the refractory Aquamboe chiefs to subjection, and then the whole were to march on to Accra through the Aquapem Mountains. It was also stipulated by Quacoe Duah that in order to prove his sincerity and desire to return to his former master, Darko Yaw should, when he was ready to start for Coomassie, send to Coomassie by certain confidential messengers of Quacoe Duah's then in Aquamboe, the heads of all those Ashantee chiefs that were killed by the Aquamboe part of the allied forces at the Battle of Dodowah in the year 1826, and which were kept as trophies in their hands. Darko Yaw having made all his preparations without the knowledge of his chiefs, secretly despatched the heads of the deceased Ashantee chiefs to Coomassie, and was about to follow with such few of his personal adherents as were privy to the conspiracy, when the whole affair was revealed to the chiefs by a mere accident. The chiefs at once assembled, consulted together, and resolved to act promptly, as the next day would see their King in the midst of the Ashantee force sent to escort him. It was agreed that they should go to the King, there and then, and if he could not give them a satisfactory account of his recent conduct, they should at once kill him. They went to his palace, and told him that they had come to consult with him what was best to be done to avert dangers that appeared to be coming upon them from different quarters, alluding to the threats and suspicions of the British Government and their native allies, that they were going over to the enemy. During the consultation the principal fetish priest counselled them to seek advice from their grand fetish. It was then resolved that they should all proceed to the village of Quajoe Osoo and consult the fetish. They went there with the King, who had not the slightest suspicion of their intentions; and everything being ready, the fetish priest was asked to tell what was the cause of all their recent misfortunes, and what they should do to avert further calamities. The priest replied, that they must at once send for the heads of the Ashantee chiefs that were in the King's possession, and perform certain rites over them. The King upon this displayed great uneasiness, and endeavoured to treat the matter as a joke, but the chiefs insisted on the production of the trophies, which, however, were not forthcoming. This being considered clear proof of the King's guilt, one of the chiefs pushed his chair from under him, another struck him with one of his own musical horns, which he took from an attendant, the rest then despatched him with clubs and cut him to pieces.
* **GOLD COAST**: 

At the time that the Ashantees invaded these Protected Territories last year, Quacoe Duah, King of Ashantee, sent messengers to Darko Yaw with several presents, including a gold ammunition pouch and 200 oz. of gold dust, as an inducement for him to secede with his people from the alliance formed between himself and the other chiefs of the Accra or Eastern District, and come over to his side and assist his troops in the invasion of the Coast by the eastern route.

* **DAHOMEY**: The King having been so successful in his expedition, the last great horrible custom is about to be performed—that is, the Gie-hole, or "Beadshouse," is to be erected on the grave of the King's deceased father. It will be a sort of monument to the father—a circular wall about six feet high, covered in with a grass roof, on the top of which will be placed a large silver bird, or lion, or imitation of some other animal. There is a similar "Beadshouse" over the graves of all the former Kings of Dahomey. Every King of Dahomey, after *finishing the funeral customs* of the deceased king, must build one of these houses—a monument of great value—over his grave. This is what the King is now about to do, and shows that the funeral customs are all ended except this last horrible one. You will see how horrible, when I tell you that *the mud for building the wall must be mingled with human blood as well as water*; and a great many precious beads are thrown into the mud. The King and some specially-selected persons must mingle this mud and build this wall. It is supposed that all the residents here will be called up to see the thing done. It is mostly the blood of the bitterest enemies that is used for this mud wall, but the Abeokutans have escaped from paying this terrible tribute of blood. The King would, no doubt, have built his wall last year with their blood, if he had taken Abeokuta, as he hoped to do.

Mr. Craft, of the Company of African Merchants here, has been sent for up to Abomey by the King on business matters.

The intention to send ambassadors to England is still entertained, and I do hope the slave-trade and many other abominable things will soon be no longer heard of any more here.

* **WEST COAST OF AFRICA**: The only Governor who saw the advantage of enlisting our influence was Sir Benjamin Pine, who, to the utter amazement of the friends of the old system, showed us a very warm friendship, and heard our advice, as he knew he could depend upon our reports. Had he remained longer on the Coast, he would have greatly developed our country. But his successors undid what he had done, his own brother included.

You will remember that Lieutenant Sealer, when he was Acting Chief Civil Commandant, went up hither to settle the palavers which arose in consequence of the people's superstition about the small-pox, which he did in a very clever way. Well, when Captain Edmunds returned, poor Sealey had to pay the whole cost of this expedition, to the amount of about 18l., out of his own pocket! And this was one of the wise acts of our dear Pine, who is lamenting that he is one of the most ill-used innocents in existence!

Still, our work, thanks be to our Lord, is growing fast. The old fetishism is showing everywhere that they feel that the end is approaching, and they prepare for the last struggle. But the victory must belong to Christ, and him even crucified! Glory be to Him for ever!—Believe me, faithfully yours,

**DAHOMEY.**

**TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.**

Great Popo, July 29.

Dear Sir,—Being away down here on business, I have not been a witness of the last great custom for the late King, which you will have heard a month or two ago was about to be held for building the blood-house over his grave. We hear that the mud being used for building this monument is mixed with human blood and liquors instead of water. The greater portion of the prisoners made by the King from the five towns he took on his late expedition will be sacrificed for this purpose.

There is no demand for slaves for exportation now. The slave merchants who had collected a number for shipment are now selling them back to the natives, to work on their plantations. This point, at least, has been gained. But it is a great pity we cannot get some parties, with a little capital, and with knowledge, to settle here, and instruct the natives in raising other produce, in addition to, or instead of, palm oil. It would be, indeed, a great blessing to this Coast.

A French vessel loading palm kernels was lately driven ashore here. She became a total wreck, and has been left to be plundered by the natives.—Yours, truly,  
J.

Burton, in his speech, said "that the Christian converts were the curse of Western Africa." Before leaving this coast, on his last visit, he wrote the following letter to the members of the Wesleyan Missionary Committee: "I cannot terminate my journey to Dahomey without expressing my gratitude to your missionary at Whydah, the Rev. Mr. Bernasko. That gentleman not only made my visit pleasant by his kindness and civility, but also enabled me, by his influence with the King, to contribute my hints in the cause of humanity and civilisation. Having heard that you entertain an idea of removing the Wesleyan missionary from Whydah, I would respectfully suggest to you the advisability of adopting a wholly different course, of strengthening rather than of abolishing it; and wholly unsolicited I have ventured to address to you these few lines." Let me say that Mr. Bernasko, about whom Captain Burton writes, is a native minister, and therefore a "Christian convert."

Mr. Walker, from his speech, appears to be also an enemy to the missions in Africa. Before he left Lagos he took the chair at the Annual Wesleyan Missionary Meeting held there, and spoke in the strongest language of the benefits derived from the labours of missionaries.

The above facts speak for themselves.—Yours faithfully,  
An Englishman.

**THE NILE.**

The following from Mr. Samuel Baker, the enterprising discoverer of another great source of the "Nile," the lake "Albert Nyanza," has been received at the Foreign-office, London:—

*(Copy.)*
* **A Royal Monument in Dahomey**: Whydah, Dahomey, June 30, 1868.

Sir,—I went up to Abomey in January last, to witness the erection of a monument which the king was going to make for his father. It was thus: He built three round houses in one of the palace-yards, named Commasie. They were each ten feet in diameter; one was for his deceased father, one for the supposed deceased friend of his father, and one for the late king's mother, who died before him. The following tools and materials were given by the king for making the monument: 2 gold pickaxes, 2 silver ditto; 2 gold hoes, and 2 silver ditto; 2 gold trowels, and 2 silver ditto; 2 copper hoes, 2 brass ditto, and 2 iron ditto; 2 iron pickaxes, 2 copper ditto, and 2 brass ditto; 1 gold-gilt watering-pot, and 1 silver-gilt ditto; 24 puncheons of rum; some gold and silver coins; some coral and other kinds of beads; some pieces of silk damask (these were torn into small pieces); and the blood of forty human beings caught by the king in his wars. All these implements were equally divided between the two prime ministers, Mingah and Maywoo, for mixing the swish, and during the mixing he threw into the mixture two boxes of gold-dust, the coral and other beads, the silk pieces also, and the blood of the human beings. This work occupied about a week. The coverings were silk, bamboo mats, and grass; and three ornaments—one like a vessel, one like an eagle, and one like a large umbrella tree—were put on the top of the three circular houses which we call monuments. At the front eight posts and cross-sticks were erected, and skulls and coral and other beads were hung on them. Smaller posts, similarly ornamented, were at the sides. On the day of the dedication almost everyone in the kingdom made presents to the king—gold coins, cowries, cloths, bullocks, sheep, goats, ducks, fowls, pigeons, palm-oil, &c. This also occupied about a week, and at the close of the presents the king produced six ornaments, some made in Europe and the others in Dahomey, in the form of hand lanterns, which were then shown to the assembly, the king saying that he had made them for his good father, who left him a large property to enjoy his kingship with. Three weeks after this he went on a war expedition, to some place of which we, the residents, are ignorant. He returned home unsuccessful, and of course, not being content at having come back empty-handed, made another expedition to five small places, which he broke, and caught all the people and brought them to Abomey. Now, lately, on the 20th inst., he made the gun custom, which ended yesterday. On this occasion all the captains swore in the large market that they would go to Abeokuta in four months' time and fight against the people there, and break the place, and catch every soul, and show them that the king has braver warriors yet than those whom the Abeokutans defeated in the last war. There is to be another custom shortly.—Yours faithfully,  
D.

## In African societies, the use of elaborate monuments, symbolic artifacts, and ceremonial customs underscores the cultural and political significance of honoring ancestors, demonstrating authority, and maintaining diplomatic relations.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the cultural and political significance of honoring ancestors, demonstrating authority, and maintaining diplomatic relations in African societies through the use of symbolic artifacts and ceremonial customs. The textbook highlights the role of ritual and mystical power in Central African societies, where insignia and charms were used for protection and authority, and emphasizes the belief in a community of the dead alongside the living, underscoring the importance of ancestors in societal structures. It also discusses the cultural significance of symbolic artifacts like charms, amulets, and talismans, and the role of religion in binding societies together, which can be seen as a form of maintaining diplomatic relations. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of elaborate monuments. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details on the construction of elaborate monuments, such as the "Beadshouse" in Dahomey, built over the graves of deceased kings and involving symbolic artifacts like gold and silver tools, beads, and human blood, highlighting the importance of honoring ancestors and displaying authority through grand customs. The articles also describe the use of symbolic staffs in diplomatic missions and ceremonial customs like the "Royal custom" involving sacrifices, further emphasizing the cultural significance of these practices. They also mention the denial of human sacrifices by Dahomeyan envoys, suggesting a complexity in the portrayal of these customs. Together, these sources illustrate how African societies use monuments, artifacts, and customs to honor ancestors, assert authority, and engage in diplomacy, while also highlighting differences in the emphasis on monuments.

* **Society and power in Central Africa (c. 1800-80)**: In addition to these material factors, however, there existed ritual aspects of power, represented by insignia and charms against enemies both within and without. How did the exercise of ritual and mystical power develop at a time of rapid reversals in the military and economic fortunes of these societies? Until historians have turned their attention to this question, our understanding of the history of the region must remain incomplete and confined within terms of reference that fail to reflect the deep aspirations of the ancient societies of Central Africa.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Traditional African religion in the pre-colonial period**: In addition to these supernatural entities, there were other spirits or mystical powers which were recognized and reckoned with for their ability to aid or harm human beings. Included in these were agents of witchcraft, magic and sorcery. Finally, there were charms, amulets and talismans which were used for protective as well as offensive purposes.
The general conception of man was that he was a compound of immaterial and material substance. The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities. Human society was an unbroken family made up of the dead, the living and the yet unborn.
With regard to man's relation to society, being human meant belonging to a community and that involved participating in the beliefs, ceremonies, rituals and festivals ofthat community$^{2}$ and membership of the community was emphasized more than a member's individuality. For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife. An individual did not stay in one stage of existence for ever; he necessarily moved on to the next, and in order to make the transition smooth, special rites were performed to ensure that no breaks occurred, and movement and regeneration continued perpetually. 3
African traditional religion was not only pervasive, it also bound men to the unseen powers and helped them to form correct relations with the non-human powers; it also bound men to their fellow human beings.
Religion acted as the cement which held societies together, providing them with support and stability. Furthermore, traditional religion helped men to understand and control events, to relieve doubt, anxiety and guilt.
* **Patterns of authority**: Kano and Bunafu thus represented two different models of the way in which the power structure affected agricultural development in Africa in the early nineteenth century, one where authority was centralized and structured, the other where it was diffuse and informal. This is not a distinction between 'state' and 'stateless' societies as anthropologists have earlier suggested. In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables.
* **The expression of African nationalism and politics**: Regardless of the degree of exposure to western influences experienced by the colonized African, a common base for the expression of African nationalism were the different forms of cultural movements. The point has been made about the resilience and continuing relevance of African cultures and institutions throughout Africa for the colonized. Even the most westernized of African educated elites were faced with the reality that they were essentially Africans whatever their degree of acculturation. Most of the youth movements already referred to, and as will be seen later, showed an awareness of the crucial importance of their culture to the preservation of their self-identity in spite of the inroads of Europe by way of the school system. The various Gikuyu associations were a good example. So also were the pan-African movements and the rather fluid concept of nØgritude which, as has been shown in Chapter 21 above, found expression from the early 1930s, as well as the so-called 'nativistic' and 'religious' movements already referred to.
* **African music**: OPPONENT: Nobody goes both ways at the same time. You have told this and that. One of the two must be wrong. That is why I am attack› ing you. (sings) 'A thief speaks with another thief. It is because you are bad that I attack you.' 7 In spite of tendencies towards romanticization, racial extravagance and other forms of sentiment and bias, it is impossible to deny the larger truth of claims on behalf of music in the lives of the African peoples. According to a contemporary Shona musician: Much of African history has been handed down ... in song. [As you play mbira and sing] you can see the panoramic scenes of those bygone days and the vague dreamy figures of the past come into ... focus in the modern time ... You can almost see your ancestors limping towards the living world again .. . 8
What has been written about the griot in Malian, Senegalese, Gambian and Guiæean societies, not merely as the leaven of social occasions, but as recorder, historian, cultural formalist of society, is more than applicable also to the Shona musician, whose instruments, the mbira, inspired the comments quoted above. The griot has been amply celebrated in the epic of a slave's descendant who returned from the United States in the last decade to trace his Gambian ancestry.$^{9}$ To move from the griot's home in the Western Sudan southwards to Central and Southern Africa is to encounter his counterpart and the epic of his survival in a phase of even greater violence and instability. Even for Southern Africa with its history of epic empire-building and its attendant warfare and violent subjugations, the five decades across the turn of the century were singularly insecure for the inhabitants and recorded numerous violent dispersals.
* **The theatrical arts**: The theatrical arts were, in most instances, an extension or elaboration of the musical; some of the examples already given above demonstrate quite effectively how difficult it is to draw the dividing line. However, as the theatrical arts evolved in the nineteenth century through contact with outside influences, they do offer, more specifically than in music, evidence of the processes of transposition from traditional to adaptive modes. The West African coast truly dramatizes the situation, shifting forms and local› ization under the double assault of Islamic structures and Christian evangelizing, the latter being in turn supported by the influence of returnee slaves in Sierra Leone and Liberia, who brought with them the entertain› ment forms of their countries of exile, their manners, values, costumes, and idioms. 11 Throughout the nineteenth century, theatrical professionalism was a way of life in the old Oyo empire in Nigeria, representing the evolution of secular theatre from masked representation during the funeral rites of a king. The disintegration of the empire under the assaults of the Fulani from the north, and the ravages of civil war with rebellious dependencies to the south, led simultaneously to the spread of the professional troupes to the south and across the borders to Dahomey (now Benin), and to its demise in its place of origin. The victorious Muslims banned most forms of theatrical per› formances, and most definitely the genre represented in festivals of the ancestors whose representation of human figures was anathema in the Muslim religion.
* **Political structures**: Christianity served a similar purpose, providing a cultural framework for creating a Creole society out of disparate groups of peoples settled in Freetown and surrounding villages, as in various settlements on the Liberian coast, or in Libreville, Freretown, and other freed slave settlements. In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15
* ****: A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination. What was true in 1976 can be seen as having been even more commonplace in that more dramatic period of external domina› tion in Africa, when an entire people, its social organizations, and its economic and artistic patterns became subjugated to strategies for maximum exploitation by outside interests. The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word. The Arabic dimension was unique in its own right, an ambivalent face of expansionism which none the less left strong cultural impressions on the landscape. Yet the reality that we extract from that period is the resilience and even increased vitality of the forms and values of the authentic cultures of the peoples.
* **Change and continuity**: Nor is the 'traditional-modern' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku'ranic and Western schools.
Thus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant 'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of "civilization" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as 'enthusiastically and successfully' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting 'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives'$^{3}$ available to them.
* **The significance of colonialism for Africa**: On the other hand, in the cultural and social field, the impact of colonial› ism was relatively neither profound nor permanent. Such changes as were introduced in the cultural field, such racial discrimination as was practised, and such condemnation of African culture as was preached even in the heyday of colonialism, were all confined primarily to the coastal areas and the urban centres, and never penetrated into the rural areas where life ran gaily on very much as before. African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained. Today, African art, music and dance are not only taught in educational institutions of all kinds but are now in boom in Africa and gaining recognition in Europe. Thus, as far as the cultural field is concerned, colonialism was certainly a mere episode and its impact skin-deep and very ephemeral.
* **African traditional religion and colonial rule**: Africans used their religion as a weapon to resist colonial rule and its threat to their values, and often relied on magic and the intervention of their ancestors and gods in their fight against colonial oppression. In the first two decades of this century, the Igbo warriors of south-eastern Nigeria resorted to such means to defend themselves from alien invaders. The Esza people of Abakaliki Division, the Uzuakoli and the Aro may be cited as examples.$^{6}$ Some cults were clearly a focus for resistance to colonial rule, such as the Mwari in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), or secret associations like the Poro in Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa. War-charm movements also occurred in Madagascar and the Congo basin. In East Africa, especially Kenya, African prophets arose to provide spiritual reinvigoration$^{7}$ to resist colonialism, such as occurred in the Machakos District among the people of Kilungu in the early months of 1922 (see Chapter 26). One of the best-known movements which used both religion and magic to resist colonial rule and oppression was the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa during the first decade of the twen› tieth century.$^{8}$ (See Fig. 7.1.) Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities. Besides, the movement provided the seed for African nationalism which was later to germinate and blossom into the struggle for independ› ence and its final achievement in the 1960s.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance. In some cases, the Dyula community became thoroughly assimilated into the local community. Such instances of total assimilation were rare, but I. Wilks, in his informative study,$^{36}$ points to one example - the Tagara of Jirapa in north-western Ghana. The process was insidious enough. As already discussed in the case of the funeral rites of the Koumina canton, the Africans retained their custodianship of land, both physically and ritualistically, so that while, in the towns, contacts with the French and Islamic 'civilizing' missions, demonstrated undeniable advantage for the converts, the seasonal 'commuting' between land and city itself displaced 'unsecured' groups and individuals. Such was the fate of the Dyula.
* **The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean**: The forms of resistance already noted during the colonial period, when small numbers of fugitive slaves including half-castes banded together and attempted to live outside the system imposed by the colonizer, emerged in the late eighteenth century. These groups maintained the values typical of African societies. The isolation or integration of these 'runaways' in terms of the national society varied in the nineteenth century with the degree of development of the country concerned and with the stage reached in the socio-economic evolution from a world characterized by the rural values of an economy centred on plantations, farms and sugar mills to forms more closely resembling the type of economy existing at the end of the century and at the beginning of the twentieth century.
The integration of blacks into rural society varied according to the re› quirements of agriculture, the shortage or availability of labour and the size of the contingents of migrants from Europe, some of these contingents arriving for the express purpose of finding work within the labour system, as in Brazil in the coffee plantations. This integration is revealed in a variety of ways, encompassing the songs of African religious groups in Cuba and Brazil, the rhythm of African instruments$^{74}$ which were effectively incor› porated in the musical culture, the art of African cooking, the utilization of certain African techniques as, for example, in Haiti, the use of agricultural implements such as the hoe among others, and the transmission of religious values and philosophies of life. Despite the break imposed by the practice of slavery, African culture survived and, what is more, created a new culture.
* **The theatrical arts**: melodies to be totally forgotten. Christmas and New Year at the turn of the century, and in the first decades of the twentieth, witnessed the streets of the capital cities of Freetown and Lagos transformed by mini-pageants reminiscent of Latin fiestas, of which the caretla, a kind of satyr masquerade, '$^{7}$ appears to have been the most durable.
* ****: The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions. It was also a cultural imposition and it used culture to buttress the political, economic and social superstructure which colonial› ism represented. It is the religious aspect of this cultural imposition of colonialism and the African response to it that this chapter deals with.
* **African architecture**: Inside the hut the coolness of the air seems delicious, when one comes in from the scorching outside. Above the door, like some huge keyhole, is a kind of columbarium shelf, where vases and household objects are arranged. The walls are smooth, polished, varnished. Opposite to the entrance is a kind of high drum made of earth, very prettily decorated with geometrical patterns in relief, painted white, red and black. These drums are the rice bins. Their earthen lids are luted with clay, and are so smooth that they resemble the skin of a drum. Fishing tackle, cords, and tools hang from pegs; sometimes too a sheaf of assagais or a shield of plaited rush. Here, in the dim twilight of an Etruscan tomb, the family spend the hottest hours of the day; at night the cattle come in to join them - oxen, goats, and hens ... everything is in its proper place; everything is clean, exact, ordered. There is no communication with the outside as soon as the door is shut. One's home is one's castle. 2
It would be futile to claim that all African housing of this period was capable of arousing such flights of lyricism in the traveller, yet one can only regret that little of the urban architecture of the time found it rewarding to borrow from the structural lessons of such traditional architecture.
* **The theatrical arts**: Again, another irony of colonial intentions. While Bob Johnson was preparing his first West African tour and Hubert Ogunde, later to become Nigeria's foremost 'concert party' leader was undergoing his aesthetic formation from the vying forces of a clergyman father and a grandmother priestess of the osugbo cult,$^{22}$ in Senegal, a European educationist, Charles Beart, was beginning to reverse the policy of European acculturation in a leading secondary school in Senegal. The extent of this development including also an appreciation of the slow pace of such an evolution - will be better grasped by recalling the educational character of assimilationism, spelt in diverse ways by the publications of such dedicated African Francophiles as the AbbØ Boilat, Paul Holle, etc. Boilat, in spite of proofs of extensive sociological research,$^{23}$ the result of his examination of the culture, philosophy, social structure, languages, etc., of the Bambara, Sarakole, Wolof, Serer, Tukulor and Moorish groups in Senegal, found no lessons to be drawn from African society for a modern cultural develop› ment, no future but to witness 'the fall of all those gross, if not dishonorable, ways known as the custom of the country '. If his addresses to the metropolitan centre of the French world did not become the cornerstone of French assimilationist policies, they undoubtedly played a key role in their formu› lation.
* **The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean**: A feature of this syncretism was observance of Catholic feast days and saints' days, together with recourse to the orixas and to voodoo. Thus, the feast days of the gods coincided with the dates of the Catholic saints' days. Bastide asserts that syncretism is no more than a white mask for Negro gods. The values of the two religions interpenetrate in varying degrees. In Brazil, for instance, a series of Catholic sacraments, such as baptism, are repeated not only for ritualistic purposes but also to give the individual additional strength. This acculturation of values of European origin marks even the forms closest to the African sources, such as candomblØ, macumba and other cults, some of which are close to, or even characterized by, magic. In the case oimacumba, attention should be drawn to the presence of Amerindian values, the acculturation here being of a threefold variety.
Examples of syncretism involving Amerindian culture can be seen in the West Indies, particularly in Honduras, where a mestizo people has emerged as the result of interbreeding between Amerindian women and Africans referred to as black Caribs.$^{73}$ These Africans were the descendants of the Igbo and Efik and, subsequently, of the Fante, Asante, Fon and Congo.
The 'African societies' gradually turned into 'black societies', varying in the strength of their connection with Africa and in their integration in society as a whole, in the sense of gaining full citizenship.
From the social standpoint, integration in society as a whole was keyed to the following variables: the type of society of the white colonizer; the form of land exploration; the religion of the colonizer - Protestant or Catholic; the percentage of Amerindians in the population and the degree of integration in the economic process imposed by the regime of the colonizer, either during the colonial period proper or following the attain› ment of independence by the Americas.
* **The abolitionist period**: But since the plantation complex varied throughout the Americas the socializing forces within which the Africans and their descendants would mould their own American culture likewise varied. Throughout the Amer› icas, therefore, the amalgam of cultures would demonstrate great variety.
Certainly this can be seen in the modifications which took place in the worship of Shango, perhaps the most widely distributed African religious form in the New World.$^{47}$ While the Nigerian - more specifically, the Yoruba - origin was never in doubt, the forms of Shango varied con› siderably from Cuba, to Trinidad, to Haiti, to Brazil. In Cuba, in particular, the cult became quite Catholicized, and the originally male African Shango became female, while other forms of the ritual as well as the symbols were transposed and, in some cases, transformed. What held true for the worship of Shango also followed in other aspects of community life and organization. It became increasingly more difficult for creóle Africans to maintain their original social forms in the New World, however great their numbers, owing to the development of a structure which had stabilized by the nineteenth century, and to which they were forced to become a part, and to make necessary adaption.
* **Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects**: Besides these educational exchanges, a series of pan-Africanist organizations and conferences, as well as commercial and literary or cultural activities 47. See R. D. Ralston, forthcoming, for development of this argument. put Africans in touch with American blacks and helped to influence events in colonial Africa. The activities of four persons dominated the develop› ment of formal, organized pan-Africanism during the colonial period. The first was Booker T. Washington, founder and principal of Tuskegee Institute, the educational model for many African and Caribbean com› munities. The second was Dr W. E. B. Du Bois who, as editor of the magazine The Crisis and 'father' of the pan-African Congress movement, per se, made Africa a subsidiary activity of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Marcus Garvey, who used his UNIA not only to forge an emigrationist movement but to promote organizational or political solidarity between all peoples of African descent was the third, and the last was AimØ CØsaire who (in concert with other Caribbean blacks such as LØon Damas of Cayenne, Dr Jean Price-Mars of Haiti, and the Senegalese poet-politician Leopold Senghor) propounded a cultural variant of pan-Africanism of black group-consciousness, called nØgritude, largely within the Francophone black world.
While the pan-Africanist interest, involvement, and impact of Washing› ton and Tuskegee on Africa and on enrolled and aspiring African students were considerable, those aspects of Washington's work are not well known. The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: the change which his father had made. Here he called some of his captains, and gave them about two fathoms each of the silk damask, and explained that he did this because the Ayors would not allow silk damask to be worn at Kanna. Now the Ayors holding the cloths shall have to tell their fathers in the other world that it is not only worn to cover their nakedness, but to sweep ground with. The captains who received it wore it in such a way as to sweep the ground, and walked about where the twelve poor fellows were standing, having some of the skulls of their ancestors in a large brass pan before them. The poor fellows did not know that they were to be killed until now; and how they did look and tremble! Who could rescue them from the lion's mouth? We shall soon see their fate. The speech was then turned against the Abbeokutans and the English people who resided there.
* **DAHOMEY**: The King having been so successful in his expedition, the last great horrible custom is about to be performed—that is, the Gie-hole, or "Beadshouse," is to be erected on the grave of the King's deceased father. It will be a sort of monument to the father—a circular wall about six feet high, covered in with a grass roof, on the top of which will be placed a large silver bird, or lion, or imitation of some other animal. There is a similar "Beadshouse" over the graves of all the former Kings of Dahomey. Every King of Dahomey, after *finishing the funeral customs* of the deceased king, must build one of these houses—a monument of great value—over his grave. This is what the King is now about to do, and shows that the funeral customs are all ended except this last horrible one. You will see how horrible, when I tell you that *the mud for building the wall must be mingled with human blood as well as water*; and a great many precious beads are thrown into the mud. The King and some specially-selected persons must mingle this mud and build this wall. It is supposed that all the residents here will be called up to see the thing done. It is mostly the blood of the bitterest enemies that is used for this mud wall, but the Abeokutans have escaped from paying this terrible tribute of blood. The King would, no doubt, have built his wall last year with their blood, if he had taken Abeokuta, as he hoped to do.

Mr. Craft, of the Company of African Merchants here, has been sent for up to Abomey by the King on business matters.

The intention to send ambassadors to England is still entertained, and I do hope the slave-trade and many other abominable things will soon be no longer heard of any more here.

Yours,

* **The Fantee War against Elmina—Burning Attah's House, Etc.**: On Saturday, the 4th inst., reports of musketry were heard at Cape Coast. Immediately after messengers arrived, with the report that the Elminas, about 2,000 in number, had suddenly attacked a village belonging to Cape Coast of about 150 inhabitants, and killed four persons, the rest escaping unhurt. This excited the Cape Coast people, and, in spite of Mr. Ussher's threats to bombard the town, they all went away to defend their brethren, and they are now there encamping against the Elminas. The next day, which was Sunday, the Administrator ordered the house in which Attah, the Headman, had resided to be pulled down to the ground, because he was, the Administrator said, the first to set a bad example, for he had gone some weeks before to the camp. The Administrator, before ascertaining who the property belonged to, ordered soldiers from the garrison to pull the house down to the ground. Much valuable property belonging to three different estates of three brothers, bequeathed to an aunt and cousin, which the Headman Attah had no share or portion in whatever, were burnt. Among these very valuable books and Bibles were thrown into the flames, to the great horror of the multitude who witnessed the scene, and the very heathen gave vent to their feelings. *Is the Bible to be burnt at all, and more so on a Sunday, by white men who say they are God's people?* Amongst these properties there was a cedar coffin, prepared by one of the above deceased for the aunt; this was also burnt, amidst mournful cries, she throwing herself upon the coffin, begging that this her last home that was left for her to be buried in by her late nephew, should not be burnt, she being over fourscore years old. Notwithstanding all these entreaties an axe was immediately applied to the destruction of the coffin, which was committed to the flames. The poor old woman sat near this flame all day and night bewailing for her losses, she having now no surviving relation to make her another coffin, being deprived also of all her wearing apparel and all the money she had to subsist on; so that everybody who went to look upon this misery could not help dropping tears. I could not describe to you half the misery of the scene.

Rumours have reached us here that a large armed force is on the other side of the Prah, sent by the King of Ashantee to assist the Elminas. There are some very extraordinary circumstances connected with this matter, and being bound in honour to communicate nothing to you but the truth, I reserve giving you the particulars of what caused the Ashantee force to be raised in aid of the Elminas. Suffice it to say for the present that they were invited down through secret mission by the authorities.

The Dutch pay a stipend of 100l. currency to the monarch of Ashantee. Lately, when the last monarch died (Quacoe Duah), great customs were performed for him at Elmina by the natives, with salutes of guns from Elmina Castle in honour of the deceased monarch.—Yours,  
Fantee.
* **A Royal Monument in Dahomey**: Whydah, Dahomey, June 30, 1868.

Sir,—I went up to Abomey in January last, to witness the erection of a monument which the king was going to make for his father. It was thus: He built three round houses in one of the palace-yards, named Commasie. They were each ten feet in diameter; one was for his deceased father, one for the supposed deceased friend of his father, and one for the late king's mother, who died before him. The following tools and materials were given by the king for making the monument: 2 gold pickaxes, 2 silver ditto; 2 gold hoes, and 2 silver ditto; 2 gold trowels, and 2 silver ditto; 2 copper hoes, 2 brass ditto, and 2 iron ditto; 2 iron pickaxes, 2 copper ditto, and 2 brass ditto; 1 gold-gilt watering-pot, and 1 silver-gilt ditto; 24 puncheons of rum; some gold and silver coins; some coral and other kinds of beads; some pieces of silk damask (these were torn into small pieces); and the blood of forty human beings caught by the king in his wars. All these implements were equally divided between the two prime ministers, Mingah and Maywoo, for mixing the swish, and during the mixing he threw into the mixture two boxes of gold-dust, the coral and other beads, the silk pieces also, and the blood of the human beings. This work occupied about a week. The coverings were silk, bamboo mats, and grass; and three ornaments—one like a vessel, one like an eagle, and one like a large umbrella tree—were put on the top of the three circular houses which we call monuments. At the front eight posts and cross-sticks were erected, and skulls and coral and other beads were hung on them. Smaller posts, similarly ornamented, were at the sides. On the day of the dedication almost everyone in the kingdom made presents to the king—gold coins, cowries, cloths, bullocks, sheep, goats, ducks, fowls, pigeons, palm-oil, &c. This also occupied about a week, and at the close of the presents the king produced six ornaments, some made in Europe and the others in Dahomey, in the form of hand lanterns, which were then shown to the assembly, the king saying that he had made them for his good father, who left him a large property to enjoy his kingship with. Three weeks after this he went on a war expedition, to some place of which we, the residents, are ignorant. He returned home unsuccessful, and of course, not being content at having come back empty-handed, made another expedition to five small places, which he broke, and caught all the people and brought them to Abomey. Now, lately, on the 20th inst., he made the gun custom, which ended yesterday. On this occasion all the captains swore in the large market that they would go to Abeokuta in four months' time and fight against the people there, and break the place, and catch every soul, and show them that the king has braver warriors yet than those whom the Abeokutans defeated in the last war. There is to be another custom shortly.—Yours faithfully,  
D.

* **THE GOLD COAST.**: 

**Whydah.** They promised to grant us this as soon as we were ready to depart. On the night of the 27th inst. Prince Gbo, who succeeded the King during his absence, called upon me where I put up. We sat in long conversation, and I seized an opportunity to direct it to the subject of religion, and asked him whether he would not like to have the Gospel preached in his country. Poor man! he could not understand what I meant by the terms "preaching the Gospel," but after a little explanation he seemed to like it, but confessed that nothing of the kind could be allowed to be introduced into his country without the sanction of the King of Dahomey. On Monday morning, the 28th inst., having procured carriers, we left for the next station, about eight to twelve miles from Godome, where we hoped to procure a canoe for Whydah. Along the way from Godome to the wharf is occupied by an extensive course of water about three or four feet deep, and no stranger can get through without going by hammock. Accordingly I procured one, to be carried by four men. Leaving Godome at seven, we went through, and whilst two men bore the hammock upon their shoulders, the other two had to raise me up by the shoulders and waist, so as to prevent my being dragged along through the water: this occupies a course of about five to six miles' distance. As there are many custom-houses by the way, to whose officers we were bound to pay tribute, my guide told me that we should endeavour to secure Prince Gbo's staff, as he is the senior officer of the customs, excepting those in the Whydah station; by this means we should pass along unmolested. I accordingly availed myself of the opportunity of securing this. It is three feet long, the head is carved exactly like a man's right hand held or stretched out. If a man hold out his right hand with his fingers stretched out he sees the staff to which I am alluding. I got to the next station early, about 9.30, for my carriers moved as fast as they could, and then waited for the rest of the carriers, who got to the station about eleven o'clock. My guide then delivered the staff to the officer of this station—a wild and hungry-looking fellow of about fifty years of age. This man became angry on seeing this staff, because it prevented him from perpetrating his intentions. Notwithstanding this, he insisted upon the opening of my boxes. My guide, who is one of them, and knows their uncivil behaviour, told me to open them. I refused, alluding to the staff for my security. He then went and ransacked my guide's boxes and other luggage, deprived him of all his provisions, &c., seized and took away five of my mats which were to have covered me in the canoe, and told my guide to tell me I must pay something. I was obliged to make him a present of some money, besides the things he had seized, ere I was permitted to proceed. Having secured a canoe and men, we left this station for Whydah at 12.30. This is one of the principal stations of the King of Dahomey, in which a Wesleyan Society had flourished for some time. We had a pleasant voyage all along; but at length our canoe unfortunately ran upon a stump and narrowly escaped being capsized. On the morning of the 29th inst. I engaged a man to take me upon his shoulders, and had to walk about two hours in water three or four feet deep along the way to Whydah. As this is a chief station, we of necessity called here and obtained permission, else we would not be permitted to proceed. After visiting several persons in the place, and viewing other parts of the country, in which I noticed its populated state, the prosperity of trade, the beauty of the country itself, as well as its fine buildings, I thought what a sad thing indeed it is that a country possessed of such resources has not a single church or chapel to adorn or complete its beauty! As my guide told me we should get to my station the next day, or the third day at the longest time, and being resolved to proceed to Aguay that evening, I asked him to proceed with me to the palace of Prince Dinadu, and obtained permission to go away and get to my station in time. Accordingly we proceeded. But a minute or two before we left, Mr. Buko, our landlord, mentioned that he heard it noised abroad that the English Government were sending men as spies to Whydah. I told him I had heard nothing of the kind. Before this time it appears a similar report had gone forth informing the Prince that there are spies in the land; and, as we were bound to see him before we left, he was prepared also to meet us. Our landlord accompanied us to the palace of the Prince, who seemed to be exceedingly angry at our presence, and manifested a feeling totally unfriendly at the onset. Mr. Buko, our spokesman, knelt down, clapped his hands together several times, told him our mission, and besought him to grant us permission to pass to Little Popo, where we expect to begin our work. He inquired of me, through the interpreter, "Why did not the Wesleyan Missionary Society build the chapel there before sending men to take possession of it?" I said to my guide that there had been a chapel not only there, but even in Whydah, as well as Augway, &c., but these had been broken up. But for the good of the people and the instruction of the children this Mission wishes to renew these societies, and for this cause they sent me. On hearing this he was exasperated, and ordered us to return immediately by the way we came, and inform him by whom we were sent, that we have no permission or authority to proceed thither. All along from Dahomey beyond Popo is under the King's jurisdiction. Our Superintendent must write a letter of inquiry to the King of Dahomey and the princes or chiefs about his kingdom, so that due consideration might be given to the subject. As I had suffered a little from ill health shortly before I undertook my journey this way, I pleaded to obtain permission to have my course through Popo, not far from Whydah, so that I might return by the mail packet to Lagos, as the way through which I came to Whydah is rather tedious. Here he said he would not hear from me a word more, but I should return immediately by the way I came. He then called out, and a wild-looking gentleman presented himself, knelt down before him, and clapped his hands together several times. Upon his person we observed scores of keys suspended about his neck and waist. This he did to frighten me away. This individual I conjecture to be the keeper of the doors of the prison. On seeing this I became thoroughly convinced and satisfied that evil was determined upon, and that danger was at hand if I persisted. I beckoned to my guide and landlord, the latter kneeling and clapping his hands several times: we then bowed and retired from the palace. On returning to our landlord's house, we found him much troubled about this matter. We had thought at first to pass the night in Whydah, as the day was far gone; but having now found that we were becoming obstacles in the way of our landlord, we thought it most prudent to retire. There are scores of towns and villages situated on either side of the river which I saw on my way to Whydah. Also from Lagos up to Porto Novo we find scores of towns and villages on either side of the river. — *Wesleyan Magazine.*

* **Gold Coast**: The forces of the King of Gaman are reported to have obtained great successes in conflicts with those of the King of Ashanti. It is much to be desired that the Gamans should be able to maintain their cause against Ashanti, and not meet with the fate of the Djaubins, who were partially encouraged by British Government officials, but afterwards abandoned and allowed to perish. The King of Gaman demands of the King of Ashanti a gold stool and sundry other articles in gold, seized and carried to Coomassie by the Ashantees when they subjugated the Gamans, about a hundred years since. There is a general opinion that the Gamans will put an end to the Ashantee rule, if they can obtain adequate supplies of arms and ammunition, the want of which by the Djaubins facilitated the triumph of the Ashantees, and the breaking up of the Djaubin power. The Gold Coast people desire that the Gamans should be the conquerors.
* **FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.**: Among the passengers on board the mail steamer Lagos, which arrived at Liverpool from the West Coast of Africa early in November, are the Dahomeyan envoys, sent by King Behanzin to confer with the French Government, with a view to peace. The party includes the king's great chiefs, Chedingar and Ayumkuken; his messenger, Tassah; Mr. Henry Dasos, an interpreter, and Mr. John P. Jackson, editor of *The Lagos Record*. The chiefs stoutly deny that the King of Dahomey is the inhuman monster he has been represented to be. They affirm that no human sacrifices are offered in Dahomey, except at the annual "Royal custom," which, however, has been suspended for the past four years. At this custom all the royal maidens are required to fetch water from the sacred streams of Golutar. This water is sprinkled in the royal mausoleum, after which sacrifices of sheep and oxen are made by the fetish priest, followed by a human sacrifice, the victim being commissioned to convey messages to the spirits of the deceased kings, and to invoke their guidance and protection for the throne and kingdom. The chiefs, in support of the foregoing, assert that of the 4,000 Yorubas captured in the last raid at Abeokuta four years ago, not one has been offered in sacrifice, and that it is a capital offence to shed human blood in Dahomey, and also that any chief or prince who would cause one of his servants to be beaten so that he fainted would be imprisoned for life. The chiefs were well pleased with the treatment and comfort they received on the voyage to England, and what they saw in the Liverpool streets and docks caused them great surprise.

These envoys took 21 days to get from Dahomey to Lagos on account of their adopting a circuitous route in order to avoid the French troops who are now operating in Dahomey. The Chief Chedingar takes to France the staff of King Behanzin, which is entirely made of silver, and represents the head of the sacred shark of Dahomey. This is the first time that this staff has ever left the country, and this is also the first occasion on which Dahomeyans have left Africa to treat with a civilised nation.

The envoys are represented to have declared that the King maintains that General Dodds deceived him, and he was

## Tensions and potential conflicts between colonial powers and local African communities were exacerbated by aggressive and disrespectful actions from British forces, reflecting broader resistance to colonial interference in governance and trade.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that tensions and potential conflicts between colonial powers and local African communities were exacerbated by aggressive and disrespectful actions from British forces. The textbook highlights instances such as the British interference in local governance, exemplified by the imposition of unqualified chiefs during the Asante uprising of 1900, and the demand for the sacred Golden Stool by the British governor, which was a profound symbol of Asante identity. The use of violence and mercenaries, as seen in the resistance by the Nandi in Kenya, and the tactic of "divide and conquer" further illustrate the aggressive actions that fueled resistance. Additionally, the imposition of taxes, forced labor, and the undermining of local trade monopolies, like those held by the Mazrui family, demonstrate broader resistance to colonial interference in trade. Similarly, The African Times articles describe aggressive colonial interference, such as Captain Glover's rumored plan to attack Eppe by bribing local chiefs, and Captain Ness's arrest of local leaders in Ningo, reflecting forceful imposition of authority. The violent confrontation in Quittah, where British forces killed several natives, and the failed military expedition against King Karimoo, further underscore the violent and disrespectful actions of British forces, contributing to local resistance. Together, these examples from both sources illustrate the aggressive and disrespectful actions of British forces that intensified conflicts with African communities, aligning with the claim of exacerbated tensions and broader resistance to colonial interference in governance and trade.

* **The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Kenya**: Lenana of the Maasai similarly allied himself with the British by contrast with another section of the Maasai who were opposed to a foreign presence in their area. Often those who made an alliance with the British were rewarded with posts such as chiefships in the colonial system. So Lenana, like many others, was made a paramount chief of the Maasai in Kenya. African resistance varied in accordance with the nature of the society and in accordance with how each community perceived the external threat to its sovereignty. '$^{s}$ What differed was the extent or otherwise of resistance. As Ochieng puts it, 'practically everywhere in Kenya the imposition of colonial rule was resisted. Better armed and employing groups of mercenaries, the British imposed their authority only by violence'. 16 On the coast, the Mazrui family resisted the take-over by the IBEAC. This resistance was led by Mbaruk bin Rashid who organized hit-and-run warfare against the superior weapons of the British forces. It took reinforce› ments of Indian troops brought in by the British to defeat him. He fled Tanganyika, only to fall into the hands of the Germans. The Mazrui resistance came about as a result of British attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the coastal societies. After the Mazrui family had settled in Takarungu on the Kenya coast, they had gradually begun to extend their influence to many parts of the coast. They acquired, for example, the monopoly of buying grain from the Mijikenda people along the coast and had thus come to control the sale of food crops on the coast. The monopoly was resisted by the Giriama between 1877 and 1883 when war broke out between the two groups. The Mazrui were defeated. There› after, they had come to some understanding with the Giriama whereupon the two communities became trading partners. The coming of the British interfered with this arrangement as well as the internal organization of the Mazrui society, providing one reason why the Mazrui resisted the imposition of British rule.
When in 1895, the Wali Takarungu died, the IBEAC chose their local friend to succeed him instead of Mbaruk who had a better claim to the throne but was known not to favour the British presence.$^{17}$ It was for this reason that Mbaruk sought to drive the British away from the coast by force.
* **African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > The Yaa Asantewaa War**: Like the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898, the Asante uprising of 1900 was precipitated by the attempts of the British to consolidate their rule by the deposition of some of the anti-British chiefs and the appointment to replace them of people who were not traditionally qualified, and by the imposition of a tax, in this case 4s per head, as a war indemnity in 1897. But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.
Similar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony. This resistance by the Baule which broke out in 1908 continued until 1910 when, using the notorious search and destroy tactics, the French suppressed all remain› ing opposition with a brutality and wickedness unparalleled in the annals of African resistance (see Plate 6.5a). At the end of this, the population of the Baule had dropped from about 1.5 million in 1900 to about 260000 by .191 i.$^{6S}$ The neighbours of the Baule, the Guro, the Dan and the Bete held out till 1919.
* **Anti-colonial movements in East Africa to 1914**: and this failure did indeed make 'the passing of the old societies inevitable'. 49 On the whole, between 1890 and 1914 dramatic changes took place in East Africa. Colonialism was imposed on the people, violently in most cases, even if the violence was sometimes disguised in the form of law. African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops. The economy there was settlerbased. Various African responses to this position have been outlined. More were to follow in the period after the First World War.
* **The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Kenya**: African response to all this was, as already indicated, both military and diplomatic, though at times there was withdrawal, non-co-operation or passivity. The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.
That the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force.
* **Early localized resistance against colonial rule and capitalism**: Flight across international borders was yet another common expression of discontent. Although the clandestine nature of the exodus precludes any accurate assessment they appear to have been rather large in scale. Official British records indicate that more than 50000 Africans living in the Zambezi valley fled into Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland between 1895 and 1907 in the misguided hope that British colonialism would be more benign.$^{42}$ The existence of a common or related ethnic group on either side of the frontier facilitated the withdrawal of the Ovambo and Bakongo from Angola and the Shona and Chewa from Mozambique (see Fig. 8.1). In Nyasaland large numbers of lakeside Tonga and Tumbuka migrated from the Rukuru watershed to outside the sphere of British control to avoid paying taxes; 43 Creation of refugee communities in desolate areas constituted a variant of the withdrawal strategy. Rather than crossing international boundaries, the peasants, many of whom had refused to satisfy their 'legal' responsi- bilities, created autonomous enclaves. This phenomenon occurred with some regularity among Bemba dissidents who fled into the interior. 'Out of reach, the mi tanda dwellers attained a kind of independence which they fiercely and jealously guarded'.$^{44}$ A similar pattern occurred in the Gambo region of southern Angola which became a hide-out for outlaws and the disenchanted, in the rugged Gaerezi mountains separating Mozambique from Southern Rhodesia, and in the forest and mountainous areas of the Congo.$^{45}$ Although little is known about the internal organization of these communities, their commitment to remain free and their location in harsh backwater areas is strikingly similar to that of the maroon communities of escaped slaves in the Americas. 46 Other fugitive communities, not content just to remain outside the sphere of European control, adopted an aggressive posture towards the colonial regimes. They attacked specific symbols of rural oppression - the planta› tions, labour recruiters, tax collectors and African police - in an effort to protect their natal villages and kinship groups from continued harassment and exploitation. Like the 'social bandits' of Sicily or north-eastern Brazil, analysed by Eric Hobsbawm,$^{47}$ the attacks were led by individuals who were not regarded as criminals by their own society, although they had violated the laws of the colonial regime. The best known of'social bandit' leaders was Mapondera who successfully battled Southern Rhodesian
* **Early localized resistance against colonial rule and capitalism**: The peasants also developed a number of techniques to avoid or minimize the discomforts of forced labour. In the most extreme situations, as in the case of the Namwhana and Lungu of Northern Rhodesia, they took up arms and drove the recruiters off their land.$^{38}$ Labour grievances also precipitated the 1893-4 Manjanga insurrection in the lower Congo and countless uprisings in the rubber collecting areas.$^{39}$ Other less dangerous tactics included feigned illness, work slowdowns, strikes and fleeing. In the Abercorn District of Northern Rhodesia colonial officials repeatedly complained that the Africans 'loafed and systematically had to be driven'. Ultimately, the workers ceased their labour entirely until they were guaranteed a salary.$^{40}$ The lack of co-operation and the high rate of absenteeism convinced European officials of the inherently slothful nature of the Africans. One Portuguese administrator noted that 'None of them flee on account of bad treatment, nor do they have the slightest other justifiable reason ... Thus, I am left to conclude that the great reluctance which almost all of them exhibit towards work has been the sole cause of their fleeing the services in question.' 41 Other disgruntled workers sabotaged agricultural equipment, burned warehouses and robbed stores belonging to the concessionary companies and local traders, and destroyed transportation and communication lines.
* **Models of African initiatives and reactions**: War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals. They also provided pretexts for British interference in African affairs through offers of 'liberation' and 'protection' to the underdogs, 'alliances' with less powerful kingdoms, and invasion of the militaristic ones. The British employed a deliberate tactic of 'divide and conquer'. As a result, they exploited African rivalries, fears and weaknesses to their fullest advantage.
* **The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14**: British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.
The missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population.
* **The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation**: Immanuel Wallerstein has seen this war of the traders as one of the decisive events of early colonialism: 'Many parts of sub-Saharan Africa ... [had been] engaged in a process of relatively autonomous development, tied to the European world in a limited but important manner through the intermediary of merchants or state trading agents on each side ... Yet in 1879 this whole structure began to crumble, and by 1900 it had ceased to exist.' With the imposition of colonial rule, 'the characteristic link between Africans and Europeans was no longer that between trading partners ... The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance. Hopkins warns us not to imagine that Niger delta traders like Nana Olomu were forerunners of nationalism or spokesmen for popular griev› ances, pointing out that their 'vision of social justice did not include the emancipation of their own slaves'. Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment.
* **Conclusion**: By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa. The vast majority of the Africans had by then entered the third level of resistance characterized by the struggle to obtain a favourable modus vivendi under colonial rule, economy and culture. In reality it was a different form of response to the struggles against colonial conquest and occupation, and it belongs to a different chapter in African history. For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere. The African masses were primarily recognized as the 'black problem' and were, as Jabavu described them, 'landless, voteless, helots, pariahs, social outcasts in their fatherland with no future in any path of life'.$^{14}$ Further- more, these were the first Africans to face the crisis in identity$^{15}$ created by new artificial colonial boundaries which partitioned cultural-linguistichistorical groups, by cultural shock in mining and farming compounds, the homes of the whites, and in Christian churches and schools throughout the settler-dominated world.
* **The ideology of resistance**: Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance. They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6
Over the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.
The chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ... Overnight, African political states lost their power, independence and meaning. 8
* **The economic and political setting in Southern Africa and the Belgian Congo: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in the Belgian Congo**: Given this shifting balance of power, it is hardly surprising that direct confrontations which had frequently occurred in the period preceding the First World War almost disappeared. Occasionally, alienated peasants attacked the symbols of oppression - loyalist chiefs, African police and tax collectors. Far more hazardous were peasant revolts which were reported in the Bas-Congo in the period between 1920 and 1922, in the Kwango area a decade later,$^{41}$ and among Pende peasants and workers in Kwilu in 1931 (see Fig. 27.2). A sharp increase in taxes, a 50% reduction in the price peasants received for their commodities and the decision of Unilever to lower wages on its plantations fuelled the popular discontent that led to the major uprising in 1931. The insurgents gained additional adherents when a 'prophet', Matemu-a-Kenenia, revealed that the ancestors had instructed Africans to kill or destroy all white animals and objects in the land as well as all symbols of European rule as a prelude to divine intervention and the end of white domination. The movement attracted widespread support, but it was immediately suppressed, and more than 400 Pende and one European lost their lives in the process. 42 Other religious-political movements attracted even larger peasant followings, which may be partly due to the fact that the colonial authorities had imposed a strict ban on political organizations. Their appeal also reflected the growing sense of anxiety and frustration brought on by the economic uncertainties of the 1921 recession and the depression a decade later.
* **The African challenge to European authority**: In South Africa the Afrikaner revolt of late 1914 against the government's decision to support the Allies was due both to pro-German sympathy and hatred of Britain. The Germans themselves did their best to provoke dis› affection among the African subjects of the Allies, being particularly active along the north-eastern border of Nigeria and in Libya. In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures. Rather they were directed against obnoxious features of colonial rule such as taxation, which was introduced into Yorubaland for the first time in 1916 and together with the increased powers given to traditional rulers under the policy of 'indirect rule', provoked the Iseyin riots.$^{44}$ In French West Africa the impositions of the indigØnat (a discriminatory judicial code), the reorganization of administra› tive boundaries, the suppression of chiefs or the exactions of chiefs without traditional authority were all major causes of the revolts that broke out in every colony of the federation.
These revolts were, whatever their cause, put down ruthlessly by the colonial authorities. 'Rebels' were impressed into the army, flogged or even hanged, chiefs exiled or imprisoned, and villages razed to the ground to serve as a warning. But not all protests were violent in character. Many people tried to avoid the source of their grievances by emigration or other forms of evasive action. Thus large numbers of French subjects in Senegal, Guinea, Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Ivory Coast undertook what A. I. Asiwaju has termed 'protest migrations' to the neighbouring British territories.$^{45}$ To avoid recruitment teams, inhabitants of whole villages fled to the bush. Young men mutilated themselves rather than serve in the colonial army. The protest migrations were of such magnitude that it was estimated that French West Africa lost some 62000 subjects as a result of them.$^{46}$ In Zanzibar, too, men hid all day and slept in trees at night to avoid being impressed as carriers. 47
* **The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Angola**: The latter tried on many occasions to rise up against metropolitan rule (especially in 1924-5), and subsequently against the dictatorial regime (notably in 1930), but these attempts only indirectly affected the oppressed African population.$^{77}$ Africans had become foreigners in their own country and their only apparent function in the eyes of the Europeans was their productive capacity. In those circumstances, the few strikes in which they took part in the ports (1928) or the railways (1933) were no more than flashes in the pan, and came to nothing, for there was no lasting unity between white labourers and black unskilled workers. Moreover, black workers lacked the support of the African soldiers enrolled in the colonial army, and could not look to an alliance with the assimilados who had been reduced to silence by the authorities.
* **The ideology of resistance**: some long-established peoples took their own advantage of the opportunities offered by nineteenth-century weapons and commerce to develop an arbitrary power, with the result that they could not count on popular support in a confrontation with the whites. This partly accounts for the ineffectiveness of resistance in Northern Rhodesia, where the Bemba chiefs faced what Henry S. Meebelo has called 'a popular revulsion against the ruling class', and where the aristocracy of Barotseland feared a slave uprising if they attempted to oppose the extension of British influence. ' 8 A number of historians, indeed, have stressed the importance of dis› criminating between resistances which were motivated by the desire of a ruling group to retain its exploitative power, and resistances on a much wider scale, which were often directed as much against the authoritarianism of African rulers as against colonial oppression. Edward Steinhart urges that protest and resistance can be and are directed ... against domestic forms of oppression ... Protest must be viewed as something other than the expression of national aspirations ... by focusing on leader› ship we have accepted the interpretation of anti-colonialism as 'African nationalism', a movement to expel aliens and to restore 'national' independence. If instead we look within the protest movements ... we are apt to discover that the impulses which the leaders organize and interpret are profoundly anti-authoritarian and revolutionary rather than anti-foreign and 'nationalist'. 19 Even where a long-established polity enjoyed a leadership with recog› nized legitimacy and was able to mobilize the majority of its population into resistance, recent historians have been inclined to criticize 'the narrow sense of primordial loyalty' and the 'parochialism' which did no more than to focus on sovereignty as previously understood. Such historians have emphasized instead the significance of those resistances in which the idea of sovereignty was redefined. Thus Isaacman argues that the 1917 revolt in the Zambezi valley was unlike previous resistances there, 'which were designed to regain the independence of a historical polity or a group of related peoples'. The 1917 revolt 'sought to liberate all the peoples of the Zambezi from colonial oppression', appealing especially to the oppressed peasantry of whatever ethnicity. 'The shift in primordial loyalties repre› sented a new level of political consciousness in which the Portuguese were perceived for the first time as the common oppressor.' 20
* **The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance**: century occurred only after fifteen years of diplomatic manoeuvring with Great Britain.$^{14}$ In the most extreme cases, states like Quitanghona in northern Mozambique and the Chikunda empires of the Zambezi valley willingly acknowledged the nominal authority of the Portuguese so long as no serious effort was made to impose colonial rule.$^{IS}$ This strategy, however, invariably led to confrontation, since the Congress of Berlin explicitly demanded effective control as a pre-condition for international recognition of a claim to colonial possession.
* **The generality of resistance**: In 1965 the Soviet historian, A. B. Davidson, called upon scholars to refute 'the traditional European historiographical view' in which 'the African people apprehended the coming of the colonialists as good fortune; as deliverance from fratricidal internecine wars, from the tyranny of neigh› bouring tribes, from epidemics, and periodic starvations'; in which peoples who did not resist were described as 'peace-loving' and those who did resist were described as 'blood-thirsty'. Davidson remarked that 'protectors of colonial rule refused to consider rebellion a regular phenomenon'. They explained it in terms of 'primitive and irrational' responses, or in terms of the agitation of the 'blood-thirsty' minority. 'They rejected the only correct explanation which regards rebellions as just wars for liberation, which is why they were supported by the overwhelming majority of Africans.' l In 1965 Davidson emphasized that 'many rebellions are not yet known... Often we do not have concrete information about those rebellions that are considered an established fact'. Since then, the job of 'discovering' resistances has gone on apace. Historians have begun to classify revolts more rigorously, distinguishing 'social banditry' from 'peasant rebellion', and guerrilla warfare from the clash of armies. In some cases episodes trumpeted by the colonialists as rebellions have been shown to have been forced upon the people by ignorance and fear on the part of the whites. 2 In many more cases considerable and significant resistances have been rescued from obscurity. We now possess detailed studies for most of the 'major' uprisings and in some cases a vigorous argument about how best to explain and interpret them has been taking place. From all this it is quite clear that Davidson was right to think that resistance was a 'regular phenomenon'.
* ****: Much has been written about the African response to foreign penetration and eventual rule towards the end of the last century and the beginning of the present. Most of the discussion, if not all of it, has been centred on the dichotomy between resisters, who by implication are to be praised as heroes, and so-called collaborators, who also by implication are to be condemned as traitors. This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1
Among the resisters, there were also divisions. There were those who took to armed confrontation with the intruders - active resistance. Then there were those who, though they did not take to arms, refused to co› operate with the intruders. This form of resistance is referred to as passive resistance. There has not been a similar treatment of the so-called collaborators. They are often put together as simply one undifferentiated group.
* **The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance**: of the most powerful states, ethnic particularism, and internal cleavages among the ruling strata or class and occasionally, between it and their subject population. Their net effect was to limit the likelihood of large-scale, broad-based and co› ordinated anti-colonial efforts necessary to counteract the distinct advantage in firepower and military technology which the European imperialist forces enjoyed.
* **Marketing**: Certainly, until the early 1930s, the tendency was to encourage whoever was likely to contribute in this respect. Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk. They sold their

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: the change which his father had made. Here he called some of his captains, and gave them about two fathoms each of the silk damask, and explained that he did this because the Ayors would not allow silk damask to be worn at Kanna. Now the Ayors holding the cloths shall have to tell their fathers in the other world that it is not only worn to cover their nakedness, but to sweep ground with. The captains who received it wore it in such a way as to sweep the ground, and walked about where the twelve poor fellows were standing, having some of the skulls of their ancestors in a large brass pan before them. The poor fellows did not know that they were to be killed until now; and how they did look and tremble! Who could rescue them from the lion's mouth? We shall soon see their fate. The speech was then turned against the Abbeokutans and the English people who resided there.
* **RUMOURS OF WAR AT LAGOS.**: Sir,—Since my last it has been rumoured here that our newly-arrived Administrator, Captain Glover, intends sending a consul* to Eppe, a small town situated east of Lagos. He has sent messengers to apprise Chief Possu of his intentions, and that he wished that chief to accept his proposal; but Possu, who some time ago had to engage in a war expedition in defence of his town and people, still maintains his ground. He declined, stating that he is a stranger in Eppe; that he had fled there with Kosoko for refuge, at the time of the civil war in Lagos, about 1852; and that it is impossible for him to admit a consul in that town, he being only a citizen there. In return the Administrator says he must; but Possu maintains his plea. Now it is widely spoken about that there are emissaries from the Administrator to the chiefs of the small towns bordering on the other side of Lagos Lagoon with presents to bribe them against Possu, and to accompany him in an expedition to attack Eppe. If this be true, we call upon you to denounce this act, and beg of you to bring it before the home authorities. It is said every preparation is now being made, and I am afraid it will occur before you hear of it, or, rather the home Government. The whole of the neighbouring tribes and chiefs have agreed that, on an attack upon any of their neighbours by the Local Government, they will cut off all supplies from Lagos.

Our Administrator is not yet here a month, and these rumours are already afloat. We fear to imagine what may be now getting up by him. Should anything of the sort occur, it will take us another ten years before we can be at peace in Lagos.

Please inform our Executive that if he be quiet, and reserve the Government ammunition for any attack on the town of Lagos, the people of Lagos will thank him very much.

He sent, almost directly he arrived, a message to Abeokuta that he wished to establish a post-office between Abeokuta and Lagos. I can assure you the letter was not received, and the messengers have had a narrow escape with his letter back to the Governor. These are seeking occasions under false pretences. I write this to inform you before any decree goes forth.—Yours faithfully,
* **Human Sacrifice Prevented at Ningo**: It having been ascertained that the victim was to be put to death the next day, Sunday, the Pram Pram palaver was put off, and it was decided that the urgency of the case justified a departure from the original programme, and an immediate visit to Ningo was determined upon. Accordingly, at six A.M. on Sunday, the 20th, the expedition left Pram Pram and reached Ningo at eight. Proceeding direct to the town, the civil authorities went to the King's house, the military taking possession of the market-place. The Commandant having acquainted the chiefs with the cause of his visit, gave them half an hour to deliver up the man they had in confinement, and all those persons who had any hand in the matter. Perceiving that the people were only taking advantage of the time given them to muster what they call the "companies," with a view of intimidating him, the Civil Commandant, at the expiration of the half-hour, resigned his authority into the hands of Captain Ness, a thorough man of business in his own line. In five minutes this officer had succeeded in arresting the principal chiefs and captains of the companies, but the intended victim and the chief culprit were not then forthcoming, and so perfect were his arrangements, that this was done without the least trouble, and with no resistance whatever.

The prisoners were at once marched out of the town in charge of the military; but no sooner were the people aware of this than they beat to arms, and in less than ten minutes some 400 men turned out with arms, and were rushing to the sea-beach to cut off the party. Captain Ness, perceiving this, immediately halted his men, and directing the constables to take charge of the prisoners and proceed with them and the numerous hammockmen and carriers to a certain spot, faced the advancing force of Ningos. No sooner did they see this movement on the part of the troops, than they retired hastily into their town. Captain Ness and his party remained on the same spot under shelter of some cocoanut trees for two hours, where they took their breakfast. The natives were utterly astounded at the cool indifference with which this officer seemed to look upon their warlike demonstrations. After half-an-hour they returned without their arms to the place where the officers were at breakfast, begged pardon for their conduct, and promised, if the Commandant would only wait two hours, they would bring of their own accord the two other persons that were still required. At two P.M. the expedition returned safely to Pram Pram with the prisoners.

The effect of this prompt vindication of the authority of the Government was so great upon the minds of the people of the latter place, that the next morning they surrendered all the culprits required of them before the Civil Commandant had time to demand them, the Ningos at the same time delivering up the intended victim and his accuser.
* **Ahwoonah**: The natives between the Volta and Quittah do not seem to get on well with the British authorities there. In letters we have received much of the difficulty is said to arise from uncertainty as to the limits of British jurisdiction, and not a little of it to the violence and thieving propensities of the Houssa police. By the steamer Roquelle intelligence reaches us that there is now something more serious, several thousands of the Ahwoonahs having assembled in arms and threatened Quittah. All the available Houssas at Accra have been dispatched. A correspondent of the Standard, writing from Accra, says, regarding the origin of this new trouble: "Captain L., my informant, states that on the 23rd he accompanied the Commandant of Quittah on a shooting excursion on the Quittah Lagoon; and that feeling knocked up at noon they attempted to land on a small island for the purpose of procuring some cocoanuts to refresh themselves with. Before they were well out of their boat a considerable number of armed natives suddenly attacked them, and in defending themselves with their rifles five of the natives were killed by them, they themselves escaping in their boat with great difficulty, but without any casualty. Forty-eight hours after this the natives of all the surrounding villages had mustered in arms with the avowed object of attacking the fort and town of Quittah." The Accra writer further says: "When all has been made quiet, doubtless a searching inquiry will be instituted into the circumstances which have brought about this rising. That there will be an inquiry we have little doubt; but 'a searching inquiry' would be such a novelty on the West Coast, that we shall be glad to have some authentic account of it to place upon record in our pages. If there be truth in some of the representations that have been made to us previous to the date of this outbreak, such an inquiry is highly necessary.—Ed. A.T.
* **SIERRA LEONE**: The Governor of Sierra Leone left per s.s. Benin, on April 20, on leave for England, and the following day the Colonial Secretary, Mr. J. J. Crooks, was sworn in as Administrator in the Court Hall. Until lately, whenever the Governor was absent from the Colony, the officer commanding the troops was Administrator. The appointment of the Colonial Secretary to that post is a reversion to the policy followed up to 1872. As Colonial Secretary he is *au courant* with all affairs, while the officer in command of the troops might possibly be a perfect stranger to the Colony, and would only follow the Colonial Secretary's advice. It has even happened that a young lieutenant has been in command. A deal of mischief might result under such circumstances.

The officer commanding the troops in Sierra Leone has received instructions to despatch to the Gambia River at the first opportunity 3 officers and 50 men of the 2nd Battalion West India Regiment. It seems probable that strong measures will have to be adopted with one of the Chieftains in the upper part of the river.

The Frontier Police, who were expected to prove equal to regular soldiers, have just had a serious reverse. About two weeks ago fifty of them, under the command of Major Moor and Captain Campbell, were sent to seize one of the Chiefs, named King Karimoo, in a stockaded town, out of British territory. When they had arrived before the town the natives told them to go back, as they were not at war with the British. This they refused to do, and attempted to enter, whereupon the natives fired upon them, wounding three constables severely and also Captain Campbell in the forearm. The police are said to have returned the fire without orders from Major Moor. Had they not cleared out, it is probable that the whole force might have been annihilated. Major Moor is expected here today; he is reported to be slightly wounded.

## The Ashantees, through strategic alliances with local groups like the Awoonlahs, Aquamboes, and others, played a central role in exacerbating regional conflicts and disrupting the political stability of the Eastern Districts for several years.

The claim that the Ashantees, through strategic alliances with local groups like the Awoonlahs and Aquamboes, played a central role in exacerbating regional conflicts and disrupting the political stability of the Eastern Districts is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not mention specific alliances between the Ashantees and these local groups, nor does it directly address their role in regional conflicts or political instability in the Eastern Districts. Instead, it focuses on the Ashantee's political and military strategies, their dominance over other Akan states, and their economic interactions with non-Akan regions and European powers, without providing specific details about the mentioned alliances or their impact. This absence of information suggests that the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim directly, which could be significant for historians comparing the claim to the textbook's content. In contrast, The African Times articles provide several details supporting the claim, noting that the Ashantees aided the Aquamoos and Awconlahs in war efforts, including plundering plantations and attacking trading parties. The articles report the Ashantees' active participation in conflicts, such as bringing forces against the trans-Volta Crepee and their involvement in incidents like the capture of a missionary and the detention of Mr. Simpson. These details align with the claim of the Ashantees' alliances contributing to regional instability, though the articles lack a comprehensive overview of the Ashantees' motivations or the broader geopolitical context, which could offer a more nuanced understanding of their role.

* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: However, with the Akan states the problem was essentially one of sovereignty. There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.
As proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: The third category of states included geographically and culturally distant peoples such as the Dagomba, the Mamprusi and the Gonja. They were viewed by the Asante authorities primarily as having to contribute to the economic development of the metropolis. These non-Akan states to the north were subjected to military and political control because of their economic resources. They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army. An old Asante source declared on this subject: Na yene wonom nko nhyiamu ('We did not hold council with them').
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: In the eighteenth century the Asante dynasties carved a vast empire for themselves in the heart of the forest and south of the Black Volta river bend.$^{1}$ Thanks to Osei Tutu, the founder, Opoku Ware and Osei Kodjo, this kingdom was highly integrated, with its nucleus around Kumasi and the Golden Stool (sikadwa). It wielded undisputed economic and political power over the coast and over the dependent kingdoms to the north. Towards the centre, kingdoms associated with the Oyoko clan from Kumasi gradually became subjugated and tributary on account of structural reforms carried out by Osei Kodjo, first, in the kingdom of Kumasi, and then at the expense of the neighbouring Akan kingdoms: Mampong, Nsuta, Dwaben, Bekwai, Kokofu, Bono, as also Denkyira, Ahafo, Sefwi, Adansi, etc. In this region, the Kumasihene (king of Kumasi) became the Asantehene. From this base, the Asante dynasty held political and economic sway over the coastal kingdoms (Wassa, Nzima, Twifu, Akwamu, Akyem, Akuapem, Ga and Adangbe), and more especially the coastal strip of the Fante chief› taincies. Similarly, to the north, the kingdoms of Gyaman, Gonja, Dagomba and Mamprusi came under the sway of Asante, sanctioned by a yearly tribute (ayibuade) of two thousand slaves, especially after the 1794 treaty.
The nineteenth century was to start with the reign of one of the greatest of the Asantehenes, Osei Bonsu (1801-24), whose victorious armies pushed through to the coast in a series of campaigns (1807, 1811 and 1814). The British, who at the time were caught up in the Napoleonic Wars and had no clear policy for their Gold Coast settlements, could not but recognize, through the President of the Council of Merchants, Colonel Torrane, and his successors, the reality of the suzerainty, or even sovereignty, of Asante over all the coastal peoples.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline**: The unrivalled power of Asante during the eighteenth and early nine› teenth centuries had of course been ultimately due to its favourable inter› mediary position between two poles, that is, the Niger Bend and the coast of the Gulf of Guinea, but also to its leaders' skill in political and administrative organization.$^{10}$ During the early nineteenth century, this system reached a high degree of perfection and efficiency, which alone justified its growing expansion until it engulfed the Fante states. The great Asante kingdom then comprised three types of territorial unit.
First, there was the central group of Asante chiefdoms, long united under the authority of the Asantehene by the same language, geographical contiguity, a vast network of family ties and affinities, a century of common military activities and pride in their spectacular achievements. In addition, and fundamentally, there was the mystical bond of belief in the protecting power of the Golden Stool of the Asante and the spirits of the Asantehene's ancestors.$^{11}$ Membership in the union took the following tangible forms: participation by chiefs of member states in the enthronement of the head of state of Kumasi, the Asante sovereign, and the swearing of an oath of allegiance to him; attendance at the general assembly (nhyiamu) of chiefs at which major political matters (such as war, peace and treaties) were discussed, and acceptance of the great Asante oath as the supreme instru› ment of justice for all of the Asantehene's territories. 12 These integrative institutions constituted the fundamental bases of the state machinery. They were to be found in all the Akan states as well as in Asante, which meant that the idea of the legitimacy of power through conquest had replaced that of political identity established through kinship and religion. The second category of states in this vast empire was therefore the Akan states bordering Asante territory. The peoples of these states understood the meaning of these institutions. They were expected to live under the Asantehene's authority so as to derive the same benefits from these institutions as the Asante peoples.
* **Political structures**: Notable examples of this tendency were the initial impact of the Mfecane, and the impact of trade and the Chokwe and Ovimbundu expansion on the Luba and Lunda state systems.$^{4}$ Several states and empires disappeared. And yet even more noticeable were the many new centres of power that emerged, experimenting with new administrative structures, generally tending towards a more effective exercise of power by the ruler, clearer definition of his jurisdiction, greater control of officials who owed their positions to his favour rather than their own hereditary rights, improved tax systems and the like. 5
Some historians have described these reformist movements as the activi› ties of African 'proto-nationalists and empire builders' engaged in a kind of African Scramble which in part provoked, or at least helps to explain, the European Scramble.$^{6}$ In fact, these reformist activities were not a sudden or fitful movement in any way comparable with the European Scramble. The search for more stable political structures had been going on throughout the nineteenth century and indeed before then as part of the general evolution of the peoples. Perhaps there was a quickening of the pace, and changes hitherto associated with the rise of states like Old Oyo in the seventeenth century or Asante, Dahomey, Futa Jallon, Futa Toro and Bondu in the eighteenth century became more general in the nineteenth century. Certainly there seems to have been a more determined effort to institutionalize political change in more permanent structures sustained by new military, social and economic systems.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > Summary**: Thus, in the centre and the north of the region covered in this chapter, existing political structures went into in a state of increasingly rapid decline in the nineteenth century and in some cases came to be dominated by new forces which had arisen mainly as a result of the Sokoto djihäd. These took advantage of the internal decay of the existing structures to establish themselves, before being swept away in their turn by foreign powers that were even more formidable.
There can be no single explanation for this kind of decline, such as might be offered if it were seen solely in terms of external influences, or as part of a predisposition towards colonization. There is no doubt that, as a result of processes which had come into operation some time before, kingdoms and peoples that had not adopted centralized systems of govern› ment were about to reach a turning point in their history as regards both their internal affairs and the external influences to which they were subject.
In turn, the Mossi, Bambara and Joola kingdoms had attempted to gain control of an area including both the fringes of the desert and the edges of the forest. Although none of them achieved this on any lasting basis, in each case the high point of their power coincided with their maximum north-south extension, even though the nucleus of the Bambara empire of Segu kept more closely to its west-east axis of the- valley of the Niger. However, during the nineteenth century, political instability and popu- lation movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist movements were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority, such as the Tondyon of Segu and the ministers of the court of Wagadugu. Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Social change**: Other types of tension became more accentuated in the centralized states during this period, namely Asante, the Bambara kingdoms, Yatenga, the kingdom of Wagadugu and Gwiriko: all of these witnessed rivalry between the lordly or noble class and the ruler. Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.
Lastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education.
* **Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies**: accumulated from the trade. The rivalry for control of trade increased the social disruption and this was further intensified by population move› ments caused by the contemporaneous Nguni (also referred to as Ngoni in some of the literature) invasion. The consequent instability increased the number of people who were ready to follow enterprising leaders. In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another. In the 1860s the Arabs managed to have Mnwa Sele deposed and replaced by Mkasiwa, and Mnwa Sele's brother Simba left Unyanyembe to set up his kingdom among the Konongo to the south-west of Tabora. Another member of the chiefly family in Unyan› yembe called Nyungu ya Ma we left his country in 1874 to establish a well-organized kingdom among the Wakimbu to the south-west of the Wanyamwezi. Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state. Even Isike, the successor of Mkasiwa in Unyanyembe, became powerful enough to offer the Arabs and later the Germans a great deal of resistance.
* **The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance**: Other African polities sought to overcome their limited military capacity by organizing broad-based multi-ethnic, anti-colonial alliances. The powerful Gaza ruler Gungunyane, for example, appealed to the Swazi to join the struggle against the Portuguese, while the Barue created a multi-ethnic network which included Tonga, Tawara and a variety of Shona peoples living in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).$^{21}$ As in the case of the Barue, such temporary unions occurred most often where economic, kinship or religious alliances had previously existed. The formation of the Yao confederation under Makanjuira and the MakuaSwahili alliance combined all three elements, while financial considerations underpinned the ill-fated Bemba-Arab efforts at the end of the nineteenth century.$^{22}$ Occasionally, historic rivals cast aside their animosity in an effort to survive, which explains the alliance of the central Lunda and Chokwe against the Congo Free State's forces despite a mutual enmity which dated back over a generation. Similar considerations also moti› vated the Mburuma Nsenga and Tawara to aid the Chikunda at the turn of the century and the Cuanhama-Cuamato alliance in southern Angola.
* **Somaliland > Local protest movements**: distribution or grazing needs. The Gadabursi and Isa clans, for example, were divided between Britain and Ethiopia, and, in the case of the Isa, France also. Boundaries sometimes cut across many ethnic groups, and in several cases lands belonging to one group were allocated to new owners with no traditional claims to them. The outcome was agitation to get back lost lands or to be allowed to rejoin kinsmen in a different location. The Somali people had often resisted this colonial demarcation of the frontiers by force. The joint Anglo-Ethiopian commission that was sent in 1932 to fix the Protectorate's boundary, for example, encountered violent opposi› tion from the clansmen in the area, and its officer in charge was killed. 43 These local risings against colonial rule in Somaliland were limited in scope and nature. Since they were undertaken within the traditional frame› work of the Somali segmentary system, widespread co-operation was extremely difficult. The inherent rivalry between different clans, and their internal fights for water and grazing grounds were crippling disadvantages to Somali resistance.$^{44}$ Colonial administrators took advantage of this situation to play off one ethnic group against another, and to find for themselves agents and allies. The tough policy that they used against these risings was a further reason for their limitation. Nevertheless they provided an element of continuity with the former era and laid the foundation for further popular resistance to colonialism in Somaliland.
* **Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies**: Clearly, in the Great Lakes region some of the larger kingdoms were greatly strengthened by their connections with the coastal traders. The acquisition of firearms, especially, increased their capability to raid others.
As they raided, they accumulated cattle, hoes, ivory and captives; the last two could be sold to coastal traders for all kinds of luxury goods including textiles, bracelets, beads, tableware and, above all, firearms. Larger states could raid smaller ones, but all of them raided the neighbouring noncentralized communities, who suffered the most. The exception of Rwanda and Burundi (already mentioned) shows that it was possible to form an alternative strategy in dealing with this penetration of trade. Their strength came not from acquisition of guns but from their ability to maintain stability and unity in the densely populated mountain environment. Their extensive wars and raids during the period enabled them to accumulate wealth in a situation in which ivory and captives were irrelevant.
The second region we have deliberately omitted in this section is southern Tanzania. This is because the consequences of long-distance trade in this region are best considered along with the consequences of another intruding influence, i.e. that of the Nguni, to which we should now turn our attention.
* **On the eve of the nineteenth century**: Despite these unifying rituals and institutions, a number of factors militated against the growth of highly centralized kingdoms. Among the most important destabilizing factors were the recurring succession crises at the royal capital, the reluctance of outlying officials to subordinate their economic and political interests to those of the central authority, revolts against oppressive leaders who violated the 'rule of law', the lack of ethnic The works of C. Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1972; C. Meillassoux, 1974; E. Terray, 1972 and M. Godelier, 1975, though not in total agreement, represent an important theoretical breakthrough for an analysis of class formation. and cultural homogeneity, and the absence of a standing army to police the vast regions of the kingdom. The result was an irregular, though recurring, pattern of conflict and secession. Thus, the Shona states of Barue, Manica, Quiteve and Changamire all asserted their independence from the Mwenemutapa only to be faced with the same problems within their own homelands.$^{7}$ A similar pattern characterized the area north of the Zambezi, especially in the Malawian kingdoms of Kalonga, Undi and Lundu.$^{8}$ The fragility of many states should not mask the durability of more-localized kinship and community networks which provided a bedrock of social loyalties and assistance in times of need. 9
* **On the eve of the 'Scramble'**: By 1875 there were very few indigenous regional powers. To a certain extent this power vacuum reflected the past inability of many Central African societies to organize or sustain a centralized political system. Many of the Lunda and Shona states had also undergone a process of political fractionalization. North of the Zambezi, the slave trade intensified internal rivalries in the kingdoms of the Lunda of Kazembe, Undi, Kalonga and Lundu that left them vulnerable to the seditious activities and attacks of the slave traders and their Nguni counterparts. To the south, cleavages within the Shona aristocracy, coupled with the devastating raids of the Zwangendaba and Gaza Nguni, substantially weakened the regional powers. The incursions of Zwangendaba, for example, are generally credited with destroying the badly divided Rozwi kingdom of Changamire, while the division of the Barue state into two competing factions, coupled with the debilitating Gaza raids, enabled the Goan adventurer Gouveia to usurp temporarily the Barue throne around 1875. 97 Gouveia's success was part of a larger process by which Yao, ArabSwahili, Chikunda and Nguni invaders took advantage of the power vacuum to impose conquest states. While these new military states were undoubt› edly stronger than the polities they had vanquished, the subject peoples often perceived them as alien interlopers and resented their authoritarian rule. As a result, the leaders were compelled to intensify their coercive practices, which heightened the level of hostility and increased the fre› quency of insurrections. The revolts of the lakeside Tonga, Tumbuka and Henga against the Mbwela Nguni, and of the Tonga and Chopi against the Gaza, demonstrate the growing antipathy of the oppressed. A similar spirit of defiance motivated the Tawara and Tonga to periodically challenge the Afro-Portuguese and their Chikunda allies, who had carved out large territorial holdings along the southern margin of the Zambezi. The Swahili ruler, who governed the coastal sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona, faced similar opposition. Such animosity did not lend itself to a unified struggle against the Europeans. On the contrary, many of the subject peoples subsequently refused to assist the alien rulers; others actually aided the Europeans whom they perceived as 'liberators'. 98 The dependence of the slave-trading
* **The Young Associations**: Much prominence has been given in the recent historiography to the educated elites, the Asotni or jfosomo, in the development of African politics during these years. '$^{s}$ This newly emergent group consisted of those few men (and hardly any women) who had attended the missionary schools like Maseno, Budo, Thogoto and Zanzibar, subsequently becoming teachers, catechists, clerks and artisans. Working in opposition to the colonial-appointed chiefs, and to the local administration, these people organized 'Young' Associations as protest movements through which to conduct their political campaigns. These associations therefore had a mass following. The doyen of them was the Young Baganda Association, which excelled in its opposition to the chiefs and the Kabaka of Buganda. Equally prominent was the Young Kavirondo Association in mobilizing peasants in Nyanza. As well, there was the Kikuyu Central Association, which was noted for its persistence and organizational ability during these years. To their fortunes we must now turn.
* ****: Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time. On the whole, coastal areas had had a longer contact with Europeans and Arabs than the interior areas. Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.
Apart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya. This was especially the case against the Nandi.$^{9}$ The Maasai example serves to illustrate the kind of dislocation that had taken place among the economies of various societies in this general area. Thus, colonialism came to an area already suffering from an economic crisis with all its attendant effects.
* **Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies**: In examining the consequences of the expansion of long-distance trade to the interior we have avoided discussing two major regions. The first is the Great Lakes region which is the subject of Chapter 11. Perhaps it would suffice here to note that by the middle of the nineteenth century, there were many kingdoms of varying sizes in the area. Some of them were large and powerful while others were small and weak. But all of them had participated in a regional trade network whose routes connected most of the major capitals. It was into this regional trade network that the inter› national trade from the East African coast was to be absorbed. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the most powerful of these kingdoms were probably Buganda, Bunyoro and Burundi. But there were many others less powerful, including Busoga, Toro, the Ankole states (Nkore, Buhweju and Bunyaruguru),$^{28}$ Karagwe, the Buhaya states and Buzinza.
* **Socio-economic effects of expanding trade**: By 1800, the Maasai's legendary power had significantly declined. This section of the Plains Nilotes group had reached the limits of their expansion. They had also become divided into pastoralists, who occupied the Rift Valley plains between central Tanganyika and central Kenya, and the smaller agriculturist group - the Iloikop or Wa-Kwavi - who settled in the area between Mt Kilimanjaro and the Highlands of present-day Kenya. The history of the Maasai during the period under study is dominated by the struggle between these two groups at one level and by further civil strife between the various laibons vying for leadership at another level.
This civil conflict drove groups of Maasai in different directions in the hinterland, a notable factor which inhibited an earlier penetration of this section of the interior by Arab and Swahili traders. Groups of Wa-Kwavi raided as far east as the environs of Mombasa. In 1837, a skirmish took place between Wa-Kwavi and an Arab-Swahili party that met them outside the town. The latter was badly mauled in the encounter. Contemporary sources, such as the missionary J. L. Krapf, refer to the recurrent threat posed by the Wa-Kwavi to the Miji Kenda, which justified the defensive aspects of the kaya system.
West of the Rift Valley, movement and settlement of peoples took place in the Great Lakes region. These evolved into the Bantu-speaking groups such as the Abaluyia, the Baganda, the Basoga etc., and the Nilotic groups, such as the Luo, the Acholi and others. The first half of the nineteenth century witnessed a continuation of movement, settlement and interaction in that region, as well as a crystallization of diverse political systems within different groups that lent them some relatively distinct identity. For example, in the case of Buganda, a centralized state developed, headed by the ruler (the kabaka), with his insignias of office - drums, stools and spears, and his body of counsellors, the lukiko. By the nineteenth century, Buganda, which had hitherto been dominated by Bunyoro, became more powerful and expansionist.
* **Trading circuits**: Fragile agriculture in Rwanda was offset by inter-zonal, inter-ethnic, and inter-class exchange.$^{20}$ Complementarities in production and consumption among regions of surplus and regions of shortfall created a network of communication, exchange, and interaction that reinforced the broader field upon which the Rwandan state was organized. Such routine exchanges may have permitted the retention of specialized local economies, as well as ethnic-specific or class-specific dietary patterns, reinforcing the social class distinctions in the western Lakes Plateau region.
* **Somaliland > Local protest movements**: By and large, Somali resistance in the inter-war period in the European colonies and in the Ethiopian-occupied Ogaden was local in nature and at no time involved all Somali people. This was mainly due to the fact that the Somali did not constitute a single autonomous political unit. Instead they were divided into a number of large and often mutually hostile clans, themselves 'further split into a wide array of subsidiary kingship groups', each usually composed of a few thousand men only. 33 These local risings are too many and too diverse to be enumerated here. But what they stood for could be seen from studying some of them.
* **Changing relations with the outside world**: Zinder. The unity of the Ahaggar confederation, which facilitated these economic adjustments, was without doubt the product of conflict with neighbours. In the 1870s, the Ahaggar had mounted a serious challenge to the Ajjer Tuareg to their east and north, which was growing rich with the boom conditions in Tripoli-Kano trade during that decade, and they faced hostile Tuareg groups in other directions, such as the Oulliminden to the south-west and certain Air Tuareg to the south-east. 16 A full account of resistance would also call attention to the mobility of camel nomads and their ability to migrate with their herds from one end of the Sahara to the other as long as they were willing to take up a life fraught with danger and uncertainty. A case in point is the fifty years' odyssey of the Djeramna, who first ran afoul of the French in 1881 near GØry ville during the revolt of the Awlâd Sïdï Shaykh, an uprising sparked by land shortage, news of the massacre of theTIatters expedition, and the departure of French troops to help in the Tunisian campaign. When Bü Amäma, the leader of the uprising, was deserted by his partisans, the Djeramna left to join the Ahaggar Tuareg. In 1889, they took part in a raid led by the Chaamba on the Tripoli-Kano road south of Ghadämes; somewhat later they were reported to have taken part in a raid in the Fezzän and another in southern Tunisia. With the collapse of Tuareg resistance they retreated to the Tripolitanian highlands bordering on southern Tunisia and Algeria and their raids became an issue in territorial rivalry between the French and the Turks. In 1925, they finally returned to surrender at GØry ville nearly fifty years after having "left on their wanderings. 17

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: "Now the Ayor people are no more his enemies, but the Abbeokutans," he said. "Abbeokuta is not to be counted with the number of the existing countries. They say," he said, "they have the English on their side; he has not only one European nation to be on his side, he has France, Spain, and Portugal on his side against England and Abbeokuta; or, rather, not against England herself, but those who have gone out and reside in his enemies' country against him. For them he has given whips already to his captains, and he will tie them all and bring them to Kanna to be hung there." One of his captains interrupted him by asking his favour to order his chief minister to mark out a place where those English caught shall be hung. The place was marked directly, and a banyan tree was cut to plant there until the time came for the flagstaff to be fixed and stringed with the English. Then he told Mr. — that he thought the English Queen does not know, or has not given such orders on which that consul is acting with some of the men of war officers. "Stop," he said, "it is only at Porto Novo they will cut their capers, but to Whydah or any port belonging to Dahomey they dare not come." He called out the Governor of Whydah and told him that whenever he sees any English vessel landing emigrants at Whydah, he must allow them to come ashore, and kill every one of them. The French or any other may do so, but not the English, because he has heard that when they want to take any place they cunningly land emigrants, and in a day these become their soldiers. Here he finished his speech, when Mr. — got up and told him that the English Queen and Government are still his friends; and of course, if they had any cause of complaint, they would send direct to tell him, but that of the actions of the consul or the men of war officers, being unknown to the Queen or the Government, may so far be true, such as the late Mr. Consul Foote's affairs with Porto Novo. He may not perhaps send to ask the Government before he took any severe measures, being empowered to do what he thought proper, but would afterwards acquaint the Government; and if they approved of it, it would be a name or promotion to him. His Majesty told Mr. — he had spoken the truth, presented a decanter of rum, and then got up to dance for joy, because his father had not left him in the bondage of the Ayors. On the 4th the twelve poor Ayors were sent out to fear the singers.

**WAR IN THE EASTERN DISTRICTS—ASHANTEES ENGAGED IN IT.**

**TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.**

Christiansborg, Accra, December 7, 1866.

Sir,—After having closed my letters to you, the reports which have reached us some time ago from the Volta Districts have been confirmed, from a letter received from Odonko Anu, chief of the Eastern Kroboe, addressed to the Commander of Accra, to the effect that his people are prevented from going to their plantations, owing to their plantations having been plundered and destroyed by marauders from the Aquamoo side; added to the fact of the path to Krepee having been stopped. That a fortnight ago, a numerous trading party of our men, on their way from Krepee, were seized by a party of the enemy, who cut the throats of some of the men, and took all the women prisoners. All this is supposed to have been done by parties of Aquamoos, who are aided by a body of Ashantees, said to have been despatched by their King to assist the Aquamoos and the Awconlahs in their war against us.
* **State of Affairs on the Gold Coast**: TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.

Christiansborg, Accra, April 9.

Sir,—I have only time to write you a few lines about our affairs. It is said Colonel Conran is coming out to the Coast again, either as Brigadier-General commanding the troops all along the Coast, or as our Administrator! God forbid both, the latter above all! Mr. Usher, the present Acting Administrator, whatever may be his other merits or demerits, is at least gentlemanly in his bearing. But nobody will do any good while this place is under Sierra Leone; every Administrator's hands will be too much tied up. Look at the Awoonlah affair. All was ready for operations against them in February. But the Governor-General had to be waited for, and it is now too late in the season to act. Governor Blackall arrived here in his yacht on the 6th. Government prevented his landing, so a deputation went off to him by request—twelve principal Europeans and natives. He said he could do nothing in the way of offensive operations without first communicating with the Homo Government, but will say more when he comes back on the 20th instant. You know that I have often written you, that unless matters were soon settled the Ashantees would soon take open part in the affair, and that some of them had already been down. To-day a letter came from Akim to warn us that the Ashantees are on the move to march down to join the Aquamboes and Awoonlahs and attack the protectorate. If the past apathy on the part of our Government be continued there will be terrible evil before three months are over. I will write again by mail of the 20th.—Yours, &c.,
* **Awoolah Outrages—Ashantees at Jellee Coffee—A Man Flayed Alive**: Sir,—So much for the celebrated Awoonlah peace. Providence has in its own time and way proved to the German missionaries that the Awoonlahs never did make peace.

This mail brings the following from Jellee Coffee: The place (Jellee Coffee) is full of Ashantees. The Awoonlahs have given themselves up to the Ashantees. One of the missionaries from Christainsborg, who went to Quittah intending to go by that route to Crepee, was caught by the Awoonlahs and nearly beaten to death; they knocked out half his teeth. Mr. Nicol Irvine, of this place, a native of Scotland, and one of our most esteemed merchants, who was there trading, was going to be killed, but purchased his life with two puncheons of rum If it had not been for the personal interference of John Tay, of Jellee Coffee, Irvine would have been killed. *They flayed an Accra canoeman alive!*

There were several English naval officers at Jellee Coffee at the time; the naval men assisted several of the Accras to escape on board the shipping in the roads. The Awoonlahs declare that if the Accra tribes do not attack them, they will attack the Accras. This is authentic, and you have my authority to publish it. More next mail.—Yours truly,

Accra.

P.S.—The Dart has been sent down expressly from Cape Coast by Mr. Usher to fetch Mr. Freeman, who is to be dispatched to the Fantee camp (Commendah affair) to endeavour to appease the chiefs. Mr. Usher has been arresting some of the chiefs. There is no doubt the Fantees would rather be slaves of the English than allies of the Dutch, but if this arresting of their chiefs, &c., is proceeded with there will be mischief. A.

Christiansborg, Accra, March 22, 1868:

Sir,—There is now an outcry from the Coast and the missionaries that the educated merchants and traders are a great hindrance to peace. I would like to ask, who have been the sufferers in this Awoonlah affair? What have we gained by keeping up, as they choose to say so falsely, a war excitement? Have not more than three-fourths of us been ruined by this war. Facts are now speaking for themselves. I am sorry to say that most of the European houses here are feeling the dire effects of it. You have had "Ad Valorem's" account and mine, and you have the accumulating *facts—facts* before you. The Rev. Mr. Schrenk writes against us in the *Anti-slavery Reporter*, and now you see him signing with us the memorial to the Governor-in-Chief! You must always bear in mind, as I know you do, that none of these people, the German missionaries and their commercial managers, have any *permanent interest* in these countries. They have the interest of the people at heart, no doubt, in a religious point of view; but beyond that they would sell or dispose of the country in any way that seems best to suit their present interest. The case is different with us. We have been waiting for the last two years for the restoration of peace, and have been bitterly disappointed.—Yours truly,
* **GOLD COAST.**: On the 17th, the European merchants and the educated natives met his Excellency again on the same subject—viz., the disturbed state of the country, and the combination of the Ashantees with the Aquamboes and Ahwoonahs. Mr. Irvine was again our speaker, but the Administrator invited information from any person present acquainted with the matter. Several individuals gave what information they were possessed of. Captain Russell, the Civil Commandant, corroborated all that was said as to the movements of the Ashantees, and the continued hostilities on the part of the Aquamboes. Every person present expressed his conviction that no peace could be secured on the Volta until the Aquamboes were thoroughly subdued, and that without delay, and when I tell you that the great champion of "peace at any price" from Christiansborg expressed himself to the same effect, and even declared his willingness to lead the van, I think you will give me credit for having persistently adhered to the policy I have preached so long—viz., a short war to secure a good long peace. The Administrator informed us that he quite coincided with us that such measures were absolutely indispensable, but that he could not agree with us in many points of detail, and he would therefore act in accordance with a plan he had already cut out and dried for himself before he left Cape Coast.

Mr. Simpson met the three kings and their captains on the 18th, but as I was not present I cannot inform you what took place; but I believe they endeavoured to impress on his Excellency the necessity of allowing them to proceed to immediate action and the danger of delay, and I know that they warned the Governor to beware of receiving any information from the friends of the Aquamboes and the Ahwoonahs during his journey into the interior and the Volta district.

His Excellency left for Odumasi in Crobo on the 20th February, with the view of seeing into the state of affairs for himself. On the 5th inst. a report reached Accra to the effect that he had arrived at Odumasi and had sent a message to the King of Aquamboe to meet him at that place, to come to some under...

standing; but that the king flatly refused to do so. It was subsequently further reported that Mr. Simpson had proceeded himself to Aquamboe, and had been forcibly detained there at the instigation of the Ashantee captain. On the following day, however, the Commandant received an official despatch from the Administrator, and he at once convened a meeting of the kings, chiefs, and merchants, to communicate to them the contents. This was on the 5th inst. The despatch was dated Aquamboe, March 3, and it informed the Commandant that the Administrator had concluded a treaty of peace with the King of Aquamboe—on paper!
* **THE CREPEE WAR.**: We hate war; but we know that it is sometimes inevitable; and when inevitable we like to see it carried on with vigour and decision. If there be not exaggeration in the accounts which reach us from Accra, the war against the Ashantees, &c., in the Volta districts is at last to be thus prosecuted. We hope it is all true. Petty but cruel hostilities have been ruining the Eastern provinces and their trade for now three or four years past. With a protecting Government that has ceased to protect—at least actively—and a people unused for a couple of generations to act alone, the Ashantees, and their Awoonah and other allies, have had it pretty much their own way, and would have extended their mischievous operations, but for the unexpected and firm resistance of the trans-Volta Crepee, under their chief, Domprey, who have valiantly and, so far successfully, defended their country. It became evident, however, that their resistance could not be much longer continued, and that they must be reduced by the forces that were being brought against them, unless the Accra and other seacoast tribes came in to their assistance. The native kings and chiefs were found powerless of themselves to give the required aid. And we are happy that it was so. All our efforts for years past have been directed to the forming of a public opinion among the educated...

* **SLAVE EMANCIPATION.—A BRIEF DIALOGUE.**: Sir,—As far as my limited knowledge of the English language extends, I have perused and re-perused your leading columns of the March and April numbers, having reference to the abolition of our domestic slavery by Her Majesty's Government, and I feel gratified to find you do not in any way uphold or countenance our holding slaves in the Gold Coast Coast Colony; and I am fully convinced that you are, indeed, an Englishman, and have a heartfelt regard for the British law, which requires that everybody shall be free.

Moved by this motive, I feel compelled to place you in possession of the substance of a conversation between two friends a few weeks ago, and at which I was fortunately present, as it appears to me to be interesting:—

P.—"I cannot, in fact, understand how Her Majesty's Government could free our slaves without paying something to us as compensation for freeing them."

S.—"We ought rather to reward them handsomely, in addition to their emancipation of our slaves, than to ask them to compensate us for declaring and proclaiming their freedom."

P.—"Upon what ground do you make this assertion?"

S.—"Upon what ground do you also express such opinion?"

P.—"Why, upon the ground of the war for which our slaves are to be freed by them not being our own."

S.—"Akins have, from first to last, been our faithful allies, and have remained so with us to the present day. Assins had been our allies a little before the Insimacow War, in which
[August 2, 1875.]

The celebrated General, Sir Charles Macarthy, lost his life, and who were added or united to us by the Treaty made and concluded between the King of Ashantee and Governor Maclean, after the Catamansoo or Dodoa War of 1824." Since the conclusion of the Treaty alluded to, the Akims and Assins had constantly kept provoking the King of Ashanti by plundering and kidnapping and molesting the Ashantee traders who must necessarily pass through their towns and villages. (We never recollect to have heard that the Denkirahs pursued the same course.) Then, as the result of these proceedings, "palaver goes, palaver comes all the time," as justly remarked by Mr. Hammond in his simple but interesting letter to the *African Times* some time ago. See the case of Chibbor and Gabrie, both chiefs of Assin; see also the missions to Akim by Messrs. Robertson, Martin, and Bentill, respectively, &c., and those to Assin by Mr. Blanksor and others; all these having been made at the expense of the British authorities. We had been bound by oath to protect, support, and assist our allies in cases of emergency, and the Ashanti wars had ever been caused by our allies, and therefore the Ashanti wars were our own."

P.—"I intended to argue further with you about this palaver, but the long history you have just given me has necessarily prevented me from saying anything more upon the subject, and I must bid you good night."

## During the late 19th century, the geopolitical tensions and territorial disputes in Africa, exemplified by the actions of the King of Dahomey and the contested status of regions like Whydah, underscore the competitive nature of European colonial powers, such as Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, as they sought to expand their influence and control over strategic areas, often at the expense of African kingdoms.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the competitive nature of European colonial powers in Africa during the late 19th century, as they sought to expand their influence and control over strategic areas, often at the expense of African kingdoms. The textbook highlights the Anglo-French rivalry over territories like Porto Novo and western Yorubaland, driven by both local dynamics and European geopolitical interests, exemplified by the French conquest of Dahomey in 1892 and the partition of Borgu between Britain and France in 1895. While the textbook primarily focuses on Britain, France, and Germany, with Portugal's activities noted in a different context, it does not specifically mention the King of Dahomey or the contested status of Whydah, nor does it address Spain's involvement. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details on the King of Dahomey's interactions with European nations, including alliances with France, Spain, and Portugal against England, illustrating the complex dynamics and alliances of the period. The contested status of regions like Whydah is highlighted through reports of Portuguese annexation and British blockades, emphasizing their strategic importance. The articles also mention European involvement in local conflicts and trade disputes, such as the blockade of Dahomey and the seizure of goods at Porto Novo. However, they do not explicitly mention Spain's involvement in these specific events. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the competitive colonial landscape in Africa during this era, despite some differences in the specific details and focus of each source.

Retrieved GHA chunks:
* **The growth of European interest**: Thus as early as the 1860s, at a time when the French and British governments were generally opposed to colonial acquisitions in Africa, the special circumstances of this particular African locality had already involved the two most active European nations in a struggle for territorial possession. The Anglo-French convention of August 1863 actually agreed on a partition of the area between the two powers, with the Yewa river, about 20 km west of what became the border in 1889, as the agreed boundary. The French and British declarations of protectorates in the area between 1862 and 1863 did not enjoy official ratification and had to be abandoned in the 1870s. But the struggle was resumed again in the 1880s, partly because of the entry of Germany into the race and partly because of renewed invasions by Dahomey which increased the determination of the rulers of Porto Novo and the states of western Yorubaland to seek protection from the French or the British. The French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, the AngloFrench Partition of Borgu in 1895, the extension of British rule over the rest of Yorubaland and their conquest of Benin in 1897 must be seen as the logical conclusion of the Anglo-French rivalry of the 1860s, itself provoked by the pre-existing unities of the hinterland of the ports the European powers tried to control on the coast.
* **The growth of European interest**: The events that marked the real turning point, however, were the formal annexation of Lagos to the British Crown in 1861 and a British naval action against Porto Novo later the same year.$^{34}$ These two British actions naturally sensitized the French, who had considerable commercial interests in Whydah and Porto Novo. Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.
* **Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?**: Fourthly, while the period after the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-8 was marked, according to J. Holland Rose, by 'a state of political equilibrium which made for peace and stagnation in Europe',$^{58}$ the same period in Africa was marked by inter-state and intra-state conflict and rivalry - the Mandingo against the Tukulor, the Asante against the Fante, the Baganda against the Banyoro, the Batoro against the Banyoro, the Mashona against the Ndebele, etc. Thus, while Europe could focus her attention militarily almost exclusively on her imperial activities overseas without any distraction at home, African states and countries had their attention divided. Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.
By contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level.
* **The legacy of wars**: In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans. African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.
They continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.
It appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.
* **The growth of European interest**: Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts. European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.
Unfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port. Further west, suspicion of British political intentions grew in 1851 when Lagos was bombarded by the anti-slave trade squadron.
* **The growth of European interest**: In discussing the growth of European interest in the area of West Africa under review, it is useful to distinguish between two phases: that of freedom of movement for the European powers involved up to 1861 when Lagos was annexed to the British Crown, and the succeeding era of international rivalry between France and Britain with Germany entering the competition in the 1880s. This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.
In the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.
Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The African dimension theory**: In these cases an explanation of partition will need to emphasise external pressures, such as mercantile demands and Anglo-French rivalries. At the other extreme, it is possible to envisage cases where the indigenous rulers adopted reactionary attitudes, where attempts were made to maintain incomes by predatory means, and where internal conflicts were pro› nounced. In these cases an explanation of imperialism will need to place more weight on disintegrative forces on the African side of the frontier, though without neglecting external factors. 32 The present writer agrees with most of the views of members of this school.$^{33}$ Like them, he explains the partition in both African and European terms, and therefore sees the African dimension theory as supplementing the Eurocentric theories already discussed. He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest. It would appear, indeed, that the African dimension theory provides a better rounded, more historically focused theory of the partition than any of the purely Eurocentric theories.
* ****: Never in the history of Africa did so many changes occur and with such speed as they did between 1880 and 1935. Indeed, the most fundamental and dramatic - though tragic - of these changes took place in the much shorter period from 1890 to 1910, the period that saw the conquest and occupation of virtually the whole continent of Africa by the imperial powers and the establishment of the colonial system. The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system. The pace of this drama was truly astonishing, for as late as 1880 only very limited areas of Africa had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In the whole of West Africa, only the island and coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Freetown and its environs (now in Sierra Leone), the southern parts of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the coastal areas of Abidjan in Ivory Coast and Porto Novo in Dahomey (now Benin) and the island of Lagos (in what is now Nigeria) had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In North Africa, it was only Algeria that had by 1880 been colonized by the French. Not an inch of the whole of East Africa had come under the control of any European power, while only the coastal stretches of Mozambique and Angola of the whole of Central Africa were being ruled by the Portuguese. It was only in Southern Africa that foreign rule had not only been firmly implanted but had even been extended a considerable distance inland (see Fig. 1.1). In short, by as late as 1880, about as much as 80% of the continent of Africa was being ruled by her own kings, queens, clan and lineage heads, in empires, kingdoms, communities and polities of various sizes and shapes.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble**: Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited. Both Germany and, especially, Britain were able to wield all the influence they wanted, and no statesmen in their right senses would have freely elected to incur the costs, and court the unforeseen contingencies of formal annexation when they could derive the same advantages from informal control. 'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.
But this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique. So far as the Portuguese and King Leopold were concerned, then, the Scramble was under way by 1876.
* **Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?**: European powers were able to conquer Africa with such relative ease because in virtually every respect the dice was so heavily loaded in their favour. In the first place, thanks to the activities of European explorers and missionaries, Europeans were by 1880 far more knowledgeable about Africa and its interior - its physical appearance, terrain, economy and other resources and the strength and weakness of its states and societies - than Africans were about Europe.
Secondly, owing to the revolutionary changes in medical technology and in particular the discovery of the prophylactic use of quinine against malaria, Europeans became far less fearful of Africa than they had been before the middle of the nineteenth century. 57 Thirdly, as a result of the uneven nature of the trade between Europe and Africa up to the 1870s, and even after, as well as the increasing pace of the industrial revolution, the material and financial resources available to Europe were overwhelming in comparison with those of Africa. Thus while . European powers could afford to spend millions of pounds on overseas campaigns, African states were unable to sustain any protracted military confrontation against them.
* **The changing balance of power**: Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.
Perhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882.
* **The state of African preparedness**: Similar sentiments were expressed by Lat Dior, the Darnel of Cayor (in modern Senegal) in 1883 (quoted in Chapter 6 below), by King Machemba of the Yao in what is now mainland Tanzania in 1890 (quoted in Chapter 3 below) and by Hendrik Wittboi, a king in what is now Namibia (quoted in Chapter 3 below). But the last and most fascinating piece of evidence I would like to cite here is the moving appeal addressed by Menelik of Ethiopia to Queen Victoria of Great Britain in April 1891. Similar letters were sent to the heads of state of France, Germany, Italy and Russia. In this appeal, Menelik first defined the then boundaries of Ethiopia, and - expressing personal expansionist ambitions - declared his intention to re-establish 'the former boundaries of Ethiopia as far as Khartoum and the Niza Lake, including all of the territories of the Gallas', and added: / have no intention at all of being an indifferent spectator, if the distant Powers hold the idea of dividing up Africa, Ethiopia having been for the past fourteen centuries, an island of Christians in a sea of Pagans.
Since the All-Powerful has protected Ethiopia up until now, I am hopeful that He will keep and enlarge it also in the future, and I do not think for a moment that He will divide Ethiopia among the other Powers.
Formerly the boundary of Ethiopia was the sea. Failing the use of force and failing the aid of the Christians, our boundary on the sea fell into the hands of the Muslims. Today we do not pretend to be able to recover our sea coast by force; but we hope that the Christian Powers, advised by our Saviour, Jesus Christ, will restore our seacoast boundary to us, or that they will give us at least a few points along the coast. 4
* **The structure of Volume VII**: A great majority of African rulers, then, did opt for the defence of their sovereignty and independence. It is in the strategies and the tactics that they adopted to achieve this universal objective that they differed. Most African rulers chose the strategy of confrontation, using either diplomatic or military weapons or both. As will be seen below, Samori Ture, and Kabarega of Bunyoro resorted to both weapons while Prempeh I and Mwanga of Buganda relied on diplomacy. Others such as Tofa of Porto Novo (in what is now Benin) chose the strategy of alliance or co-operation, not of collaboration.
This question of strategy should be highlighted here because it has been 12. J. D. Hargreaves in L. H. Gann and P. Duignan (eds), 1969, pp. 205-6. grossly misunderstood hitherto and this has led to the classification of some of the African rulers as collaborators and their action as that of collaboration. We are opposed to the use of this term collaboration not only because it is inaccurate but also because it is derogatory and Eurocentric. As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty. Those who threw in their lot with the Europeans therefore had their own objective, and it is therefore totally wrong to call them collaborators.
* **Increased European pressures**: As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control. Towards the end of this period, however, the rise of Germany as a major Western power was beginning to increase the competition that already existed. Outside the East African sphere, tensions caused by this competition were already beginning to appear. When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties. The British kept hoping that strengthening Seyyid Barghash's authority on the mainland would be enough to protect their interests without direct colonization.
* **The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance**: century occurred only after fifteen years of diplomatic manoeuvring with Great Britain.$^{14}$ In the most extreme cases, states like Quitanghona in northern Mozambique and the Chikunda empires of the Zambezi valley willingly acknowledged the nominal authority of the Portuguese so long as no serious effort was made to impose colonial rule.$^{IS}$ This strategy, however, invariably led to confrontation, since the Congress of Berlin explicitly demanded effective control as a pre-condition for international recognition of a claim to colonial possession.
* **Periodization of colonialism in Africa**: The question of the periodization of the history of colonialism in Africa, which has been ignored by many historians but was raised by A. B. Davidson and Michael Crowder in the 1960s, should be briefly looked at.
Some historians have proposed 1870 as the date for the beginning of the European Scramble for Africa and the imposition of colonial rule. This date, however, seems to be too early. As G. N. Uzoigwe shows in Chapter 2, it was the activities of the French in the Senegambia region, of King Leopold of the Belgians represented by H. M. Stanley, and the French represented by Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza in the Congo region, and of the Portuguese in Central Africa that touched off the Scramble and all these activities surely did not commence until the late 1870s and early 1880s. It seems, therefore, that 1880 would be a more appropriate date than 1870.$^{20}$ From 1880 to the collapse of colonialism in the 1960s and 1970s, therefore, the study of colonial rule,and African initiatives and reactions should be divided into three eras: 1880-1919 (subdivided into 1880-1900 and 1900-19, the periods of conquest and occupation respect› ively), which we would term the era of the defence of African sovereignty and independence using the strategy of confrontation or alliance or tempor› ary submission; the period 1919-35 which we would call the period of accommodation using the strategy of protest or resistance; and the period since 1935 which is the period of the independence movements using the strategy of positive action. 21 It is our contention that the period from 1880 to about 1919, the so-called era of pacification in the view of some historians, was the period which, from the European perspective, saw the completion of the partition on paper, the deployment of troops to effect the partition on the ground, and the effective occupation of the conquered areas, signified by the intro› duction of various administrative measures and an infrastructure of roads, railways and the telegraph for the exploitation of the resources of the colonies.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Global strategy**: There is a third school which maintains that the European interest in Africa which gave rise to the Scramble was a matter of global strategy, not economics. The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic 'protonationalist' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These 'romantic, reactionary struggles' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. '$^{9}$ He even concedes that, 'What actually started the economic push into the "Dark Continent" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials';$^{20}$ and that therefore 'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion's share into her own free-trade empire'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy
* **Implications of incorporation**: The ultimate decline of Britain's advantage had nothing to do with developments in the periphery of the world-economy. It was simply the consequence of the rise of the competitive qualities of manufactures elsewhere: in France, in Germany, in the USA. The depression of 1873 detonated the active political challenge to British hegemony; in Africa as all over the world.$^{52}$ By 1879 the structure of African informal empire was crumbling; by 1900 most of Africa was colonized. 53
* **Increased European interest**: It is important not to exaggerate the extent of European power in Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century, or the rate at which Europeans acquired 'possessions' or penetrated inland before 1850. The Portuguese made extensive claims both in Angola and in Mozambique. They had established military outposts and prazos (agricultural estates) in the interior, and from time to time they controlled the area from Loje, south of Cuanza, as far east as Kassanje, apart from trading posts on the coast between Ambriz and Moçâmedes. In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials. The increased demand for slaves in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century had shifted attention from the prazo system, and the security of the trade routes depended more on the pombeiros (barefoot mulatto merchants), bearing Brazilian trade-goods and surviving only on the good will of African rulers and merchants.$^{10}$ The French had revived their trading posts in Senegambia after 1815, notably Saint-Louis and GorØe. Their venture to establish an agricultural farm in Waalo with a military post in Bakel to protect it had been a failure. In North Africa, they seized Algiers in 1830. They spent the next twenty years overcoming the resistance of the Algerians, notably the movement led by Amir 'Abd al-Kädir. The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture. With the increasing prosperity and expansion of the Creoles to Bathurst (now Banjul), Badagry, Lagos and beyond, British commercial and missionary influence was spreading along the coast and at one or two points like Abeokuta began to penetrate into the interior around 1850. On the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the British still shared the trade with the Danes and the Dutch, and took measures to resist Asante (Ashanti) efforts to dominate the coast, notably by exploiting the Fante fear of Asante domination and encouraging the Fante to act together under British tutelage. In Southern Africa, though the attempt to settle British farmers in Natal was not successful, the Cape Colony was expanding largely through the rebellious trekboers who seceded into the interior and obliged the British rulers to follow after them,
* **The African challenge to European authority**: At a time when the Allied colonial regimes in Africa could least afford trouble in their own backyards, their authority - still only tenuously established in places like southern Ivory Coast, much of Libya, or Karamoja in Uganda - was widely challenged by armed risings and other forms of protest by their subjects. As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: "Now the Ayor people are no more his enemies, but the Abbeokutans," he said. "Abbeokuta is not to be counted with the number of the existing countries. They say," he said, "they have the English on their side; he has not only one European nation to be on his side, he has France, Spain, and Portugal on his side against England and Abbeokuta; or, rather, not against England herself, but those who have gone out and reside in his enemies' country against him. For them he has given whips already to his captains, and he will tie them all and bring them to Kanna to be hung there." One of his captains interrupted him by asking his favour to order his chief minister to mark out a place where those English caught shall be hung. The place was marked directly, and a banyan tree was cut to plant there until the time came for the flagstaff to be fixed and stringed with the English. Then he told Mr. — that he thought the English Queen does not know, or has not given such orders on which that consul is acting with some of the men of war officers. "Stop," he said, "it is only at Porto Novo they will cut their capers, but to Whydah or any port belonging to Dahomey they dare not come." He called out the Governor of Whydah and told him that whenever he sees any English vessel landing emigrants at Whydah, he must allow them to come ashore, and kill every one of them. The French or any other may do so, but not the English, because he has heard that when they want to take any place they cunningly land emigrants, and in a day these become their soldiers. Here he finished his speech, when Mr. — got up and told him that the English Queen and Government are still his friends; and of course, if they had any cause of complaint, they would send direct to tell him, but that of the actions of the consul or the men of war officers, being unknown to the Queen or the Government, may so far be true, such as the late Mr. Consul Foote's affairs with Porto Novo. He may not perhaps send to ask the Government before he took any severe measures, being empowered to do what he thought proper, but would afterwards acquaint the Government; and if they approved of it, it would be a name or promotion to him. His Majesty told Mr. — he had spoken the truth, presented a decanter of rum, and then got up to dance for joy, because his father had not left him in the bondage of the Ayors. On the 4th the twelve poor Ayors were sent out to fear the singers.

It may be interesting to some of our readers who occupy themselves in the course of ocean currents to learn that a bottle floated ashore between Edina and Little Bassa on the 14th Sept., containing a paper, on which was written as follows: "Great Britain, S.S.S.—at sea, under steam. March 21st, 1862. Latitude 4 deg. 22 sec. N.—Longitude 31 deg. 28 sec. W. 51 days out from Melbourne, bound to Liverpool, another child dead, making five deaths during voyage.—W. W. Harbal. Sydney, N.S.W."

We extract the following from the missionary paper, the _Cacalla Messenger_: "It is reported that the King of Dahomey has announced his determination to attack Abeokuta in November. This will probably call forth the long-desired interference of the English to abate the horrible power of Dahomey.
* **LAGOS.**: With reference to the lamented death of Mr. and Miss Bischoff, at Abeokuta, announced in our last number, our correspondents state that "they both insisted on living in such a manner that no one doubted death would be the result."* A hope is at the same time expressed, "that others may profit by the sad lesson, and not despise the advice of old residents, who know that nourishing food and the moderate use of wine are both necessary to enable Europeans to withstand the debilitating effects of the African climate."

Commander Glover, R.N., Colonial Secretary for Lagos, had arrived, and was soon appointed acting governor, during the absence of Governor Freeman, who has returned to England in the Calabar on leave.

Although the Abeokuta roads still remain closed, we are glad to find that there have been lately some shipments of oil from Lagos. This comes partly from Badagry and Porto Novo, and partly from the Ijebu Towns. The gradual development of trade in that direction proves that Lagos would rapidly have increased in prosperity had not the Abeokutans closed the roads to their town. It is deeply to be regretted that there is no sign at present of any change of conduct on the part of the Egbas, who may yet, ere long, bitterly repent their egregious folly and ingratitude.

Walter Hanson, Esq., has been appointed Civil Commandant at Badagry, and Vice-Consul for Okeodan and Addo.

We alluded in our last to a report which had reached Lagos of the Dahomans having plundered the oil stores, &c., on Porto Novo beach. It seems that the King of Dahomey sent men down to stop the landing of goods there (the beach being his property) without his authority and payment of duties to him. Not obtaining a satisfactory explanation, they seized one hundred puncheons of rum. Our correspondent says, "This is a nice little nut for the French to crack! they will find that Porto Novo is not quite so independent of Lagos as they fondly imagined." By permission of the Lagos authorities, they have now a war steamer in their part of the Lagoon. We fear this mixing up of British, French, and Dahoman territory, rights, and claims, will lead ere long to serious complications in the Bight of Benin.

**ALTERATION IN SAILINGS.**

Shippers are respectfully informed that, commencing in January next, the service between Liverpool and the South-west Coast of Africa will be conducted by a separate line of steamers, worked quite apart from those calling at the usual West Coast ports.

The first steamer after the Congo, 16th inst., will be the Roquelle, which, unless prevented by unforeseen circumstances, will sail on or about the 29th January; to be followed by a steamer about every five weeks.

The ports intended to be called at are Madeira, Cape Palmas, Bonny, Gaboon, Black Point, Landana, Congo, Ambrizette, Kinsembo, Ambriz, and Loanda.

**WEST COAST NEWS.**

**THE BLOCKADE OF DAHOMEY.**

**CAPE COAST CASTLE, Nov. 14.**—The Dahomans, feeling the blockade severely, have planted stakes round a great fetish tree, and swear to fix on them the heads of the Europeans at the first attack made against them. A Portuguese merchant, Senhor Lino, and Senhor Da Silva (a Brazilian) have been stripped, flogged, and carried off to Abomey for saying the King should pay the fine. Their factories have been plundered. The chiefs have seized all the spirits in the factories. Seven natives have been shot by the King's orders for talking about a palaver with the British Commodore. Other outrages are of daily occurrence. The Whydahs have petitioned the Commodore for protection from the King. Troops are assembling in Whydah to attack Azooma. An attack is also expected on Grand Popo. According to other reports the King of Dahomey was said to be anxious to communicate directly with the English Government, and had sent letters to Little Popo.
* **FRENCH AFRICAN EXPLORATION.**: The writer proceeds to give some interesting information about a European established in these parts, one M. Philippe Broyon, a native of Switzerland. "M. Broyon is about thirty-three years of age. He is tall, thin, and muscular, and looks like a soldier. He did not marry the daughter of Mirambo, as has been stated, but a negress whom he rescued from slavery. He was formerly employed at Zanzibar, but subsequently took to travelling in Africa and carrying on the ivory trade. The English often tried to purchase his services, but without success, for he does not like them. However, forced by necessity, he has accepted their offers, and is now conducting a caravan of merchandise for the English.

As regards one of the monarchs of Africa, the Abbé says: "Mirambo enjoys in Europe a reputation far beyond his merits. He is a cruel tyrant, whose caprice is the only law known. His army reckons scarcely more than four hundred men. If he does not make the Europeans pay the right of passage, he knows how to make up for it in another and far more advantageous way. He proposes to every white man who crosses his country the pact of blood. At the end of the ceremony he makes a few gifts, but he besieges the European in return with demands which have to be satisfied."

The writer concludes with some remarks respecting the doings of the English. He says: "The English occupy Mpapona, which is a strategical position of the first order. All the routes which lead to Unyamezi pass by it. It is not six months that they have been there, and already four handsome stone houses have been built. A clergyman, a mason, and a carpenter compose all the personnel of the station. They are eminently practical men. The English have founded another station in the Ukereone, a third in the Uganda, and a fourth at Ujiji. The power of the Arabs in these parts is decreasing daily. The ivory trade no longer satisfies their wants, and as the slave-trade is prohibited, they will soon be forced to leave the colonies which they have founded in the interior of Africa, and the English will take their place.
* **THE REPORTED CESSION OF WHYDAH TO GREAT BRITAIN**: We have not had opportunities for ascertaining the correctness or otherwise of the reports reaching us from Lisbon of an agreement between the Portuguese and British Governments, by which the former cedes all its rights in Whydah in return for the acknowledgment by the latter of its sovereignty over territories at the mouth

of the River Congo; but if the report be true, the new year has already borne fruit of very great importance as regards the progress of civilization in West Africa. Our often expressed desire that the whole of the trans-Volta seaboard down to Whydah should be brought under British authority will then have been more than realized. It was and is the only possible remedy for evils of a very serious nature—the only peaceful means for bringing the Dahomian monarchy under those restraints of humanity by which an end shall be put to the abominable massacres which it has been but too often our duty to hold up to the condemnation of the civilized world.
* **The West Coast of Africa**: The steamer Roquelle, of the British and African Company, lately arrived at Liverpool from West Africa with mails and passengers. She brings news from Brass, where it is feared the absence of the British Consul may lead to some serious conflicts. The steamer left on the 6th September; a few days previous to which, the natives came down the river in great force, and compelled the traders to sign an agreement not to take any of their steam launches up the Brass river. Limits were marked beyond which the launches were not to go. The British Consuls have been absent from the coast for some time, and the traders themselves sent for a gunboat to be despatched to the Brass river, in order that the difference might be adjusted, and, if possible, a serious disturbance avoided. One of the traders, who the natives alleged had gone beyond the limits, was fined by the natives. The barque Benedicta was lost on Akassa Bar on the 4th September. The crew escaped to the shore, where they were held by a native chief, and not released until a ransom had been paid for them. News from Whydah announces the annexation of that place by the Portuguese. A man-of-war went specially to Whydah, and afterwards took away, it is reported, 1,200 slaves belonging to the King of Dahomey. The slaves, it is stated, go under an agreement to work in the plantation at St. Thomé, an island on the south-west coast, belonging to the Portuguese. It was not stated that the men were slaves to the Portuguese authorities, but merely that they had previously been slaves belonging to the King of Dahomey, with whom the Portuguese authorities entered into an agreement for the removal of the men from Dahomey to St. Thomé.

Our readers will find upon another page some further particulars in reference to the part which is being taken by the Portuguese authorities in support of the slave trade. A recent despatch has it that the whole kingdom of Dahomey has been placed under the "protection" of Portugal!
* **FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.**: Four times in the history of the country have the British been compelled to blockade its coast line. The last of these occasions was in 1876, in punishment for Gelele's ignominious treatment of a British subject in Whydah, and his refusal to pay the fine in palm oil imposed upon him. But this stoppage of trade really injured the Europeans more than it did the natives. The rout suffered by his troops at Abeokuta kept him moderately quiet until some months before his death. Mission after mission was despatched to him, but little result came of these. Instead of abolishing human sacrifices, he usually offered to entertain the envoy with a spectacle of this hideous description; he lamented that the interference of the white men with the slave traffic compelled him to kill his prisoners once a year, as he had really no other way of disposing of these incumbrances! As a matter of fact, the "customs" still continue, and not infrequently the Europeans in Whydah are ordered to come to Abomey in order to witness this dreadful spectacle. Nearly forty years ago the king's Army was estimated at over 10,000 men and 2,500 women; but fighting women now probably amount to 5,000. These are the dreaded Amazons. They form the flower of the troops, taking the post of honour on the flanks of the army, and fighting with a ferocity which quails at nothing. In the hands of Europeans, the country might be productive; for the soil is rich and capable of growing all tropical products. Gold is known to exist, while maize, guinea corn, cassava, yams, sweet potatoes, plantains, oranges, pineapples, ginger, sugar-cane, and a host of similar crops grow freely. Cattle, sheep, and goats live, but are not plentiful, and fowls are scarce. But it is doubtful whether such a region is fit for European colonisation. Whydah might be occupied, and a Protectorate extended over the rest of the country. But Whydah is an open roadstead, so that it is not an ideal spot, while the susceptibilities of Portugal, which has for long regarded this place as almost its own, and four years ago was on the eve of formally annexing it, must be gravely considered by any other Power.

## Some Africans believed that the British monarchy was unaware of the injustices and unjust treatment carried out by its colonial representatives, who were influenced by local intrigues.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the claim that some Africans believed the British monarchy was unaware of the injustices and unjust treatment carried out by its colonial representatives, who were influenced by local intrigues. The General History of Africa does not explicitly address this belief, focusing instead on the colonial administration's paternalistic and authoritarian nature, the manipulation of traditional leadership, and the imposition of European bureaucratic structures. It highlights the resistance of African leaders to colonial rule and the discontent among both traditional and educated elites, but it does not provide evidence of a belief among Africans that the British monarchy was ignorant of the injustices perpetrated by its representatives. In contrast, The African Times news articles support the claim by suggesting that some Africans believed the British monarchy and government might not be aware of the actions of their consul or war officers. The articles express confidence that the Queen does not wish to exercise power wrongfully and suggest that the conduct of agents, such as Colonel Conran, might be contrary to her instructions, indicating a perceived disconnect between the monarchy's intentions and the actions of its colonial agents. Additionally, the articles highlight the negative impact of local intrigues and the unjust treatment of African dignitaries under British protection, implying a lack of oversight or awareness by the British authorities. Together, these sources illustrate a complex narrative where the belief in the monarchy's unawareness is more explicitly documented in contemporary news articles than in historical texts.

* **Means of control and administration**: Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.
Even where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model.
* ****: Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other. The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3
* ****: The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness. The colonial governments made varied use, as R. F. Betts has shown above (Chapter 13) of traditional institutions and leadership elites to facilitate their control of the subject peoples. Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools. Having lost the traditionality of their positions and roles in the eyes of their people, they were treated in most cases like mere instruments of control by the colonial masters and not as real partners. The loss of real power and social status and prestige was a source of discontent for many of them.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the political field**: Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government. In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them. But in both cases, the colonial system finally diminished their authority.
* **The state of African preparedness**: What was the attitude of the Africans themselves to the establishment of colonialism, involving as it did such a fundamental change in the nature of the relationships that had existed between them and the Europeans over the preceding three hundred years? This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2
In 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them. I know what is necessary for me and what I want: I have my own merchants: also, consider yourself fortunate that I do not order your head to be cut off. Go away now, and above all, never come back. 3
* **Models of African initiatives and reactions**: War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals. They also provided pretexts for British interference in African affairs through offers of 'liberation' and 'protection' to the underdogs, 'alliances' with less powerful kingdoms, and invasion of the militaristic ones. The British employed a deliberate tactic of 'divide and conquer'. As a result, they exploited African rivalries, fears and weaknesses to their fullest advantage.
* ****: Related to ideology as a factor is the settler factor. The settler factor showed in the relative intensity of colonization as a process, the frustration of the expectations of the colonized or lack of responsiveness to African claims. This factor explains the differences in tone and intensity in the expression of African nationalism as between settler-ridden Algeria on the one hand and, on the other, French territories which did not have Algeria's settler problem. The same happened as between settler-dominated Kenya, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa on the one hand, and other British colonies. The declaration of the paramountcy of African interests (otherwise known as the Devonshire declaration) of 1923 in respect of Africans in Kenya was, in essence, an expression of the same ideology as informed British colonial administration in other regions. The different experiences of these territories resulted from the settlers' firm determina› tion to perpetuate the subjugation of the indigenous population by practising what has been described as 'ultracolonialism'. ' °
* **'Native policy'**: Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.
There were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6
* **The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14**: British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.
The missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population.
* **Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Inter-territorial movements and international movements: the National Congress of British West Africa**: Having been told that they had no history worth taking seriously, and conscious of the fact that their own socio-economic group had limited opportunities in the colonial system, it is perhaps not surprising that the nationalist intelligentsia came to prefer a visionary 'West African national› ity' to a political system in which they had no voice and which, in any case, was alien and therefore, in their view, oppressive. Gold Coast news› papers never tired of denouncing alien rule. As one of the editorials observed: 'The introduction of the British system of government in place of the one existing before was an encroachment which no self-respecting nation would allow'.
In spite of all the objection to 'alien rule', however, there was never any mention of severing relations with the colonial power; alien rule was bad but there were good reasons for consenting to it; it was better to demand more opportunities for a particular social group and make moderate demands than to do away with alien rule completely; and one could still be 'free', 'under the Union Jack'. Even Herbert Macaulay, regarded by the administration as the gadfly of Lagos politics, could speak sincerely about the 'manifold blessings of Pax-Britannica'. The National Congress of British West Africa also declared: That the policy of the Congress shall be to maintain strictly and in› violate the connection of the British West African Dependencies with the British Empire, and to maintain unreservedly all and every right of free citizenship of the Empire and the fundamental principle that taxation goes with effective representation ... to aid in the develop› ment of the political institutions of British West Africa under the Union Jack ... and, in time, to ensure within her borders the Govern› ment of the people by the people for the people; to ensure equal opportunity for all, to preserve the lands of the people for the people. ' 2 Finally, the leaders also saw themselves as the only class of people who, by virtue of their social and occupational status, were qualified to control by constitutional means what hysterical American racists like Lothrop Stoddard and Madison Grant called 'the rising tide of colour against white supremacy'.
* **The new social structures**: Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.
Furthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims. As a result, closely related and sometimes previously politically united peoples at times found themselves on opposite sides of the agreed boundary lines.
* **The new social structures**: If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.
Another aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3
* **Conclusion**: By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa. The vast majority of the Africans had by then entered the third level of resistance characterized by the struggle to obtain a favourable modus vivendi under colonial rule, economy and culture. In reality it was a different form of response to the struggles against colonial conquest and occupation, and it belongs to a different chapter in African history. For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere. The African masses were primarily recognized as the 'black problem' and were, as Jabavu described them, 'landless, voteless, helots, pariahs, social outcasts in their fatherland with no future in any path of life'.$^{14}$ Further- more, these were the first Africans to face the crisis in identity$^{15}$ created by new artificial colonial boundaries which partitioned cultural-linguistichistorical groups, by cultural shock in mining and farming compounds, the homes of the whites, and in Christian churches and schools throughout the settler-dominated world.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the political field**: Another negative impact of colonialism in the political field was the mentality that it created among Africans that government and all public property belonged not to the people but rather to the white colonial rulers and could and should therefore be taken advantage of at the least oppor› tunity. This mentality is evident from the Ghanaian saying that Oburoni ade see a, egu po mu, or, aban wotwuu no adze wonnsua no meaning that if the white man's property gets damaged, it should simply be dumped into the sea, or government should be dragged on the ground rather than carried aloft. Both sayings imply that nobody should be concerned with what happens to government property. This mentality was the direct product of the remote and esoteric nature of the colonial administration and the elimination of an overwhelming majority of Africans, both educated and uneducated, from the decision-making process. It is important to note that this mentality is still with most Africans even after decades of independence and is part of the explanation for the reckless way in which government property is handled in many independent African countries.
* **Change and continuity**: Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.
One can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations.
* **The structure of Volume VII**: The second section deals with a theme that had until the 1960s either been grossly misrepresented or entirely ignored by the colonial school of African historiography, namely, African initiatives and reactions in the face of the conquest and occupation of Africa. To the members of this school such as H. H. Johnston, Sir Alan Burns and, more recently, Margery Perham, Lewis H. Gann and Peter Duignan,$^{10}$ Africans in fact welcomed the establishment of colonial rule since not only did it save them from anarchy and internecine warfare but it also brought them some concrete benefits. Thus Margery Perham: most of the tribes quickly accepted European rule as part of an irresist› ible order, one which brought many benefits, above all peace, and exciting novelties, railways and roads, lamps, bicycles, ploughs, new foods and crops, and all that could be acquired and experienced in town and city. For the ruling classes, traditional or created, it brought a new strength and security of status and new forms of wealth and power. For many years after annexation, though there was much bewilderment, revolts were very few, and there does not appear to have been much sense of indignity at being ruled. ' ' Such ideas are also reflected in the use of such Eurocentric terms as 'pacification', Pax Britannica and Pax Gallica used to describe what amounted to the conquest and occupation of Africa between 1890 and 1914. Those historians who did pay some attention to this subject mentioned it almost accidentally or casually. In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies. It is to correct this wrong interpretation of the colonial school and to redress the balance and highlight the African perspective that we have devoted as many as seven chapters to this theme of African initiatives and reactions.
* **Ownership of the means of production**: rulers. This Society did this by appealing to the Privy Council in London which ruled that land was the 'undisputed right of the community'. " Asa result of these victories by the West Africans, the British abandoned the policy of direct control of land though in theory all lands in the conquered areas of British West Africa such as Benin in Nigeria and Asante in the Gold Coast or lands ceded to the British Crown such as Lagos were owned by the Crown while lands in the protectorates such as Northern Nigeria or the Northern Terri› tories of the Gold Coast were held in trust by the Crown for the people. 1 9 However, rigorous campaigns were mounted by Europeans like W. H. Lever, the Liverpool soap and margarine tycoon, and societies such as the British Cotton Growing Association between 1906 and 1925 for the estab› lishment of plantations in British West Africa, and indeed a few plantations were established in the Gold Coast, Southern Nigeria and Sierra Leone. These campaigns, however, failed and by 1930 only a relatively small proportion of land in British West Africa had been alienated for the use of the colonial rulers and other Europeans and most of this was for mining purposes.
* **The rise of new organizations**: As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent. With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.
The fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s.
* **Conclusions**: What were the effects of colonial African and American black interaction? Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.
Perspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the social field**: also created in some Africans a deep sense of inferiority which Afigbo has defined above quite succintly as 'a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future in short, a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of [and one may add subservience to] European powers' (Chapter 19). This feeling of inferiority has not entirely disappeared even after two decades of independence.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: "Now the Ayor people are no more his enemies, but the Abbeokutans," he said. "Abbeokuta is not to be counted with the number of the existing countries. They say," he said, "they have the English on their side; he has not only one European nation to be on his side, he has France, Spain, and Portugal on his side against England and Abbeokuta; or, rather, not against England herself, but those who have gone out and reside in his enemies' country against him. For them he has given whips already to his captains, and he will tie them all and bring them to Kanna to be hung there." One of his captains interrupted him by asking his favour to order his chief minister to mark out a place where those English caught shall be hung. The place was marked directly, and a banyan tree was cut to plant there until the time came for the flagstaff to be fixed and stringed with the English. Then he told Mr. — that he thought the English Queen does not know, or has not given such orders on which that consul is acting with some of the men of war officers. "Stop," he said, "it is only at Porto Novo they will cut their capers, but to Whydah or any port belonging to Dahomey they dare not come." He called out the Governor of Whydah and told him that whenever he sees any English vessel landing emigrants at Whydah, he must allow them to come ashore, and kill every one of them. The French or any other may do so, but not the English, because he has heard that when they want to take any place they cunningly land emigrants, and in a day these become their soldiers. Here he finished his speech, when Mr. — got up and told him that the English Queen and Government are still his friends; and of course, if they had any cause of complaint, they would send direct to tell him, but that of the actions of the consul or the men of war officers, being unknown to the Queen or the Government, may so far be true, such as the late Mr. Consul Foote's affairs with Porto Novo. He may not perhaps send to ask the Government before he took any severe measures, being empowered to do what he thought proper, but would afterwards acquaint the Government; and if they approved of it, it would be a name or promotion to him. His Majesty told Mr. — he had spoken the truth, presented a decanter of rum, and then got up to dance for joy, because his father had not left him in the bondage of the Ayors. On the 4th the twelve poor Ayors were sent out to fear the singers.

The evening of the 5th was an evil night, being a night previous to the passing round the market all his furniture to show his people.

We therefore thought it proper that John Aggery, being a prince of Cape Coast, and having a right in preference to any other, a Christian, and one of the first who preached the Gospel in our town before we ever had a Wesleyan missionary sent out to us; should be our king, and so we made him king over us. Now, because we are weak and helpless, we must be trodden down, and by England, our own protector and teacher too. This would cause even the hardened heart of Ashantee to shed tears; and we know that if the kind friends who are near our gracious Queen, and who have voice in her kingdom, were to read the African Times and see the suffering of their objects of mercy, things would be different, and King Aggery would be sent back to his own town, and not be kept at Sierra Leone to starve, and for nothing wrong done by him. Mr. Editor, thou art a man of God, and hast the desire to promote the glory of God. We pray you to let it be known that we are not ignorant of the power of the great Queen of England and the wealth of her kingdom, and we are confident that she does not wish to exercise power wrongfully over us, neither does she desire to increase the wealth of her kingdom by taking Cape Coast or the whole of Fantee, but the conduct of the agents out here puzzles us. Pray England to rectify what Colonel Conran has done against her instructions and our minds will be disburdened of their doubts. We pray Her Gracious Majesty to pity her servant, King Aggery, and send him back, so as to wipe away many tears from the faces of many poor old women and children.—My name is,

* **THE GOLDEN AXE**: In another portion of our paper our readers will find an account of the arrival in England of the Golden Axe, which so scared the Acting-Governor of Cape Coast. We are not informed of the condition under which this was delivered to Sir Samuel Rowe, and by him sent to London. It has come, however, on an errand of peace—it may be, as a token of submission. We should not have noticed this but that there is already a rumour current that this implement, the exhibition of which at Cape Coast has cost so much to the Gold Coast Treasury, is to be returned to Sir Samuel Rowe, and by him to the King of Ashanti. We hope there will not be any precipitation in this matter. If the axe being in England leads to a loss of prestige of the King among his people, we shall not look upon such a result as an unmixed evil, if at all an evil. We have before insisted that our relations with Ashanti shall be put upon such a footing that all possibility of any future scare by a nervous Governor, owing to Ashanti pretensions and demands, shall be impossible. Our efforts should undoubtedly be directed, not toward strengthening the Ashanti power, but toward rendering it permanently harmless. It is not for us to point out how this may be best accomplished. We have published some important letters, which ought to open the eyes of Sir Samuel Rowe to a lurking danger in Accra, through intrigues of certain individuals with Ashanti—intrigues that led to the unjust and ill-advised treatment received by King Takie and other African dignitaries who, instead of finding a secure asylum under British protection, have found only humiliation and a prison. We may return to this matter in our next issue. Its importance demands that we should do so if possible.

## The British colonial strategy in Africa relied heavily on military force and local intermediaries to suppress resistance, protect territorial interests, and maintain control, as evidenced by coordinated military efforts against uprisings and the use of emigrants to establish covert military presence.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the British colonial strategy in Africa, which heavily relied on military force and local intermediaries to suppress resistance, protect territorial interests, and maintain control. The General History of Africa highlights Britain's use of military imperialism, exemplified by the punitive expedition against Benin in 1897 and the conquest of Nigeria, including the annexation of Asante and the Sokoto sultanate. This strategy involved a combination of diplomacy and military confrontation, with varied Nigerian reactions ranging from open military confrontation to alliances and submission. The British effectively employed a divide-and-rule approach, exploiting African rivalries and utilizing African levies in military campaigns, as seen in the conquest of the Zambezi valley and the occupation of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. Similarly, The African Times articles describe coordinated military efforts against groups like the Angoni Zulus, led by British officers and involving local troops such as the Sikhs and Atonga, underscoring the reliance on military force. The campaign against Nupé further illustrates the use of military action to enforce treaties and suppress slave raiding. Additionally, the strategic placement of local leaders, like Masambah Kokie, to manage local affairs, indicates the use of intermediaries. However, both sources do not support the claim regarding the use of emigrants to establish a covert military presence, as neither the textbook nor the articles mention such a tactic. This absence highlights a notable difference, suggesting that while military force and local intermediaries were integral to the British strategy, the specific use of emigrants for covert military purposes lacks evidence in these accounts.

* **Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Southern Nigeria**: While the Yoruba, by and large, chose the strategy of submission, the rulers of the kingdom of Benin and some of the rulers of the states of the Niger Delta chose that of confrontation. Though Benin had signed a treaty of protection with the British in 1892, she none the less guarded her sovereignty with determination. This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies. The other Delta states - Old Calabar, New Calabar, Brass and Bonny - stunned by this treatment of one of the most powerful and wealthy rulers of the Delta states and divided internally, surrendered and accepted governing councils imposed on them by Johnston.
* **The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance**: African rivalries, moreover, facilitated a strategy of divide and rule which Harry Johnston and other colonial officials employed with consum› mate skill. The annals of the struggle for the retention of the African's independence and sovereignty are replete with examples of Africans who not only, submitted but aided the colonial powers in" an effort to avenge past abuses perpetrated by their neighbours. The Inhambane Tonga and the Sena helped the Portuguese against their respective Shangaan and Barue overlords, while in the Congo a number of subject people co-operated with the Belgians to free themselves from Yeke and Arab rule or from the slave raiders. In addition, several African leaders recognized that alliances with the Europeans could fulfil their expansionist aspirations and simultaneously strengthen their own internal position. Such considera› tions, for example, motivated Tippu Tib and the sons of Msiri to aid the Congo Free State.$^{28}$ Other African societies, including some which initially opposed the invaders, later allied$^{29}$ with them in exchange for material benefits and promises of improved status in the new colonial order. Thus, once the Yao were defeated, they helped to conquer the Mpeseni Nguni who, in turn, were used by the Portuguese to defeat the Barue. , ·;/-.,-, Without African allies and mercenaries, it would not have been possible for the Europeans to impose their rule at such a minimal cost in man› power. More than 90% of.the Portuguese armies which finally 'conquered' the Zambezi valley in 1902, for example, were African levies.$^{30}$ Although not as extreme, a similar pattern existed in Angola. To the north, the Congo Free State army consisted of African levies with some Zanzibari and Hausa mercenaries. Only, the officers were Europeans. The success of Harry Johnston's policy of divide and rule is also demonstrated by the large number of Africans who participated in the British occupation of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia.
* **Military conquest, 1885-1902**: Britain's military imperialism was equally spectacular and bloody; the African response, as will be seen in the following chapters, was also resolute and often prolonged. Operating from its coastal possessions on the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and in Nigeria, Britain halted effectively French expansion towards the lower Niger and into the Asante hinterland. The last Kumasi expedition (1900) was followed up in 1901 by the annexation of Asante, and Nana Prempeh was exiled to the Seychelles. The Northern Territories to the north of Asante were also formally annexed in 1901, having been occupied between 1896 and 1898. From the Lagos colony, Britain launched its conquest of Nigeria. By 1893 most of Yorubaland had been proclaimed a protectorate; the conquest of Itsekiriland was accomplished in 1894, and Nana Olomu, its resourceful 'merchant prince', was exiled to Accra; and while apparently unable to challenge King Jaja of Opobo in open battle, Harry Johnston, the British Consul, tricked him into attend› ing a meeting aboard a British warship, where he was made prisoner and shipped to the West Indies in 1887. Both Brass and Bini were duly con› quered by the end of the century. By 1900, British supremacy in southern Nigeria was more or less assured. The effective occupation of Igboland and some other areas of the eastern hinterland, however, were not accom› plished until the first two decades of this century. To the north, British conquest was accomplished from Nupe, where - by 1895 - George Goldie's Royal Niger Company exercised influence from Lokoja to the sea. Ilorin was occupied in 1897; and after the establishment of the West African Frontier Force in 1898 the Sokoto sultanate was conquered by Lugard in 1902.
In North Africa, Britain, already in a commanding position in Egypt, waited until 1896 when the reconquest of the Sudan was authorized. This was achieved in 1898 with savage and unnecessary bloodshed. Over 20000 Sudanese, including their leader, Khalifa 'Abdallah, died in battle. France's occupation of Fashoda in the south of the Sudan (1898) was understandably not countenanced by Lord Salisbury, and the French were forced to withdraw.
* **Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Southern Nigeria**: The agencies and methods that the British adopted to bring the whole of modern Nigeria under their control varied, as did the initiatives and reactions on the part of the Nigerians. Yorubaland was won by the mission› aries and the Lagos government; the Oil Rivers by the missionaries and the consuls; and Northern Nigeria by both the National African Company (from 1886 the Royal Niger Company) and the British government. The main weapons used by the British were diplomacy and military confronta› tion. Nigerian reactions therefore varied from open military confrontation to temporary alliances and submission.
* **Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900**: While the French resorted mainly to warfare in their occupation of French West Africa during the period 1880 to 1900, the British, by contrast, used a combination of peaceful diplomacy and warfare. Using the former approach, they concluded a number of treaties of protection with African states as they did in the northern parts of Sierra Leone, the northern parts of the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and in some parts of Yorubaland. In other parts, as in Asante, Ijebu in Yorubaland, in the Niger Delta areas and especially in Northern Nigeria, however, the British by and large used force. In reacting to the British, the peoples of the area in question, like those in French West Africa, resorted to all the options open to them, those of confrontation, alliance and submission or a combination of any of these options. Let us analyse what happened in Asante, Southern Nigeria and in Northern Nigeria as cases in point.
* **The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Kenya**: African response to all this was, as already indicated, both military and diplomatic, though at times there was withdrawal, non-co-operation or passivity. The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.
That the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force.
* **Models of African initiatives and reactions**: War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals. They also provided pretexts for British interference in African affairs through offers of 'liberation' and 'protection' to the underdogs, 'alliances' with less powerful kingdoms, and invasion of the militaristic ones. The British employed a deliberate tactic of 'divide and conquer'. As a result, they exploited African rivalries, fears and weaknesses to their fullest advantage.
* **Means of control and administration**: However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.
This account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'. Training schools, such as the Ecole William Ponty in Dakar, were undertaking the preparation of educators and administrators upon whom the colonial administration was more and more to depend. Principally in the urban regions, the 'wind of change' was slowly being generated.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the political field**: A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R. E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'. '$^{6}$ Indeed, as will be seen in the next volume, as a result of their repeated and often unnecessary and unjustifiable interventions in the politics of independent African states, those armies have become the heaviest of the millstones round the necks of African governments and peoples.
* **The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Uganda**: Probably the greatest diplomat of all those who had to deal with the advent of imperialism in East Africa in the last decade of the nineteenth century was Mwanga, the Kabaka of Buganda, which had been declared a British Protectorate in 1894. When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903.
* **'Native policy'**: Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.
This realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.
In contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2
* **The structure of Volume VII**: It will be seen from these chapters that the view that Africans received the invading soldiers with elation and quickly accepted colonial rule is not borne out by the available evidence. In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.
John D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.
* **Means of control and administration**: Whatever the variety of theories and methods of colonial domination suggested and implemented in the period between the two world wars, an emergent pattern of bureaucratic rule is evident. By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.
As its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.
* **The legacy of wars**: As noted above, the critical factor in the changing balance of power in Africa in the 1870s was not the troops, nor their training and discipline or generalship, but the quality and quantity of the guns available to the respective sides. The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.
The truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected.
* **The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance**: A number of African societies also expanded their defensive capabilities through internal military innovations. The Barue developed munitions plants which produced powder, rifles and even components for their artillery.$^{8}$ New and expansive defensive structures such as the fortified town of Jumbe of Kota and the aringas of the Zambezi and Luangwa valley were built to withstand European siege.$^{9}$ Other Africans, among them the Makua, Lunda and the disparate bands who operated in the Gambo region of southern Angola, developed guerrilla tactics that stifled the first imperialist advances. Around the turn of the century Barue, Tawara, Tonga and other Shona religious spirit mediums (svikiro) (see Fig. 8.1) provided divinely inspired medicines to neutralize the European weapons and turn their bullets into water. 10 Despite the common commitment of some of the Africans to prevent foreign rule and to acquire modern weapons, the immediate tactics they employed varied substantially. In several cases African states reacted violently to the first European encroachments despite the overwhelming military advantage which the enemy enjoyed. Thus, the Chewa leader Mwase Kasungu led his people in a futile effort against the British, ultimately committing suicide in 1896 rather than capitulating.$^{11}$ At about the same time the Bihe of Angola ambushed a colonial force seeking to establish interior posts which would cut through their homelands, and the Humbe, to the south, attacked a Portuguese force after Lisbon refused to pay rent for the right to maintain a small fort within its borders. ' 2 Other African leaders sought to avoid initial confrontations in the hope that they could either strengthen their military capacity or negotiate a 'just' treaty in which the sovereignty of their state would be recognized. For almost a decade Gungunyane (Plate 8.2) negotiated with both the British and Portuguese and was prepared to make a variety of concessions short of renouncing Shangaan independence. '$^{3}$ The Barue royal family pursued a similar policy seeking to enlist the support of Karl Peters, a German adventurer, whom they thought had close ties to Bismarck's government, while sporadic Bemba resistance at the end of the century occurred only after fifteen years of diplomatic manoeuvring with Great Britain.$^{14}$ In the most extreme cases, states like Quitanghona in northern Mozambique and the Chikunda empires of the Zambezi valley willingly acknowledged the nominal authority
* **Colonial rule and structure**: In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.
Lugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization. The egregious exception, however, was South Africa where the concept of'native authority' was the means by which the white minority assured local administration of Africans now displaced by the policy of segregation to territorial reserves.
* ****: Here two points must be made. First, as regards statements by educated townspeople, we must remember that the military conquest was preceded by lengthy psychological and political preparation. Meanwhile, the urban elite had lost all their will to resist. Those of its members who have left memoirs were not members of the resistance at the time, whatever may be said of them today. Secondly, as regards the oral accounts, we must not forget that the witnesses were bound to have been exposed to two sorts of influences. The first was European. Accounts of engage› ments seen from the colonial standpoint were published almost immediately in the specialist press;$^{4}$ it was also colonial policy to send the sons of subject chiefs to French schools in the hope of turning them into faithful allies. Barely ten years after the event, for example, a son might give details of his father's battles which the latter knew nothing about, though, from then on, he would knit them into his account in all good faith. The colonial version, though contemporaneous with the events, is not perfect; it is tainted with the hostility that existed in the armies of the colonial powers between metropolitan and colonial regiments. The officers of the latter did not hesitate to portray their campaigns in Africa in such a way as to make them look comparable to the battles waged in Europe by the former. 5
The second influence was nationalist. Operations for conquest were contemporaneous with reformist and nationalist activity in the towns. Even when they were taking place far from the towns, the townspeople eagerly followed their ups and downs and immediately used them for ideological ends. It was often the militant townsman who got the old highland warrior to dictate his recollections.
For the two reasons given, the statements we now have cannot transform the colonial account or the nationalist version: but they can throw a different light on them, always provided we go beyond their strictly local setting.
* **The structure of Volume VII**: A great majority of African rulers, then, did opt for the defence of their sovereignty and independence. It is in the strategies and the tactics that they adopted to achieve this universal objective that they differed. Most African rulers chose the strategy of confrontation, using either diplomatic or military weapons or both. As will be seen below, Samori Ture, and Kabarega of Bunyoro resorted to both weapons while Prempeh I and Mwanga of Buganda relied on diplomacy. Others such as Tofa of Porto Novo (in what is now Benin) chose the strategy of alliance or co-operation, not of collaboration.
This question of strategy should be highlighted here because it has been 12. J. D. Hargreaves in L. H. Gann and P. Duignan (eds), 1969, pp. 205-6. grossly misunderstood hitherto and this has led to the classification of some of the African rulers as collaborators and their action as that of collaboration. We are opposed to the use of this term collaboration not only because it is inaccurate but also because it is derogatory and Eurocentric. As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty. Those who threw in their lot with the Europeans therefore had their own objective, and it is therefore totally wrong to call them collaborators.
* **The War on African soil**: all Britain's longed-for Cape to Cairo route.$^{!}$ ' But once it was clear that quick victory would not be achieved, it was perceived that protracted campaigns in Africa would tie down Allied colonial troops who might otherwise be sent to the European front. This strategy was brilliantly pursued by General P. E. von Lettow-Vorbeck, the German commander in East Africa who engaged a combined Allied force - at one time over ten times greater than his own - for the duration of the war (see Fig. 12.1e).
* **The Nguni invasion**: and build up centralized political entities. But recent research$^{36}$ has indicated that this assumption is incorrect since centralization had started in both cases before the Nguni invasion. What is true is that the Nguni military techniques did strengthen the societies that adopted them and made them capable of facing the conditions of the time, including the effects of the slave trade. Besides the need for selfdefence against the Nguni themselves and against the slave-raiders, some of the societies were able to use the techniques to build up large states, as in the case of Mirambo, already discussed, and the Sangu and the Hehe in the southern region.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: "Now the Ayor people are no more his enemies, but the Abbeokutans," he said. "Abbeokuta is not to be counted with the number of the existing countries. They say," he said, "they have the English on their side; he has not only one European nation to be on his side, he has France, Spain, and Portugal on his side against England and Abbeokuta; or, rather, not against England herself, but those who have gone out and reside in his enemies' country against him. For them he has given whips already to his captains, and he will tie them all and bring them to Kanna to be hung there." One of his captains interrupted him by asking his favour to order his chief minister to mark out a place where those English caught shall be hung. The place was marked directly, and a banyan tree was cut to plant there until the time came for the flagstaff to be fixed and stringed with the English. Then he told Mr. — that he thought the English Queen does not know, or has not given such orders on which that consul is acting with some of the men of war officers. "Stop," he said, "it is only at Porto Novo they will cut their capers, but to Whydah or any port belonging to Dahomey they dare not come." He called out the Governor of Whydah and told him that whenever he sees any English vessel landing emigrants at Whydah, he must allow them to come ashore, and kill every one of them. The French or any other may do so, but not the English, because he has heard that when they want to take any place they cunningly land emigrants, and in a day these become their soldiers. Here he finished his speech, when Mr. — got up and told him that the English Queen and Government are still his friends; and of course, if they had any cause of complaint, they would send direct to tell him, but that of the actions of the consul or the men of war officers, being unknown to the Queen or the Government, may so far be true, such as the late Mr. Consul Foote's affairs with Porto Novo. He may not perhaps send to ask the Government before he took any severe measures, being empowered to do what he thought proper, but would afterwards acquaint the Government; and if they approved of it, it would be a name or promotion to him. His Majesty told Mr. — he had spoken the truth, presented a decanter of rum, and then got up to dance for joy, because his father had not left him in the bondage of the Ayors. On the 4th the twelve poor Ayors were sent out to fear the singers.

The evening of the 5th was an evil night, being a night previous to the passing round the market all his furniture to show his people.

On the morning of the 6th I found at the gate leading to that part of the palace where he sat last for the custom seven human heads, freshly cut, four laid on one side, and three on the other, with their faces on the ground.
* **Good Service rendered by Colonel D'Arcy**: **GOOD SERVICE RENDERED BY COLONEL D'ARCY.**

_Brilliant Charge of the 4th West India Regiment—Five Marabout Towns Levelled to the Ground._

More of these _Marabouts_ we must always expect to hear. Their restless and impetuous spirit will always lead them to intrude on their neighbours' property, which will eventually end in war and bloodshed. Early this year, Baccary Sardah committed a terrible onslaught on the people of Woollie, destroyed a vast amount of property belonging to the British merchants, and escaped scot free to his own country, enjoying the fruit of his plunder. He had not been made to taste _British projectiles_, and, consequently, most of the Marabouts along the river have since considered that they have unlimited licence to commit any outrage on British subjects, even within British possessions. Indeed, they have believed that the new arrangement in the Government had so fettered the hands of the Administrator that he would be obliged to receive insult and insolence unrevenged from their hand. They also considered the kind, conciliatory bearing of his Excellency towards them as nothing more nor less than a dread of their impetuosity and power. But they were fully undeceived in an affair which has lately taken place in the _one mile piece of ground_ ceded by the King of Barah to the British Government.

A few years ago, his Excellency the Administrator placed _Masambah Kokie_ in _Fritish Nenny_, as chief of that part of the country, to cultivate the ground, and to keep peace. At this time the Marabout influence had been growing very strong, and the Marabouts seemed certain to become very troublesome. _Masambah Kokie_, being a Soninkee and a British subject, was more peaceful than the Marabouts, and all the Foolahs flocked about his town, Bantang Koto, with their bullocks, much to the annoyance of the Marabouts in these parts, who, a few months ago, made a night attack against them, and robbed them of all their cattle. Some remonstrance was made to their chief, but nothing decided was done. They became more restless, and their chief Mahfal charged Masambah Kokie with having robbed them of their land, telling him that he was nothing but a stranger, and that the sooner he make his exit the better it will be for him. Masambah Kokie judiciously informed his Excellency the Administrator of what had taken place, and intimated that the attitude of the Marabouts was very warlike. He was supplied with guns and ammunition.
* **WHEAT CULTIVATION IN WEST AFRICA.**: Extract.

"A correspondent sends us the following extract from a private letter just received from Lagos, by the steamer Loanda: 'A proclamation from the Egbas, Jebus, and the Yorubas was received here on January 11, stating that they will not open the roads until the English give up, and all white men leave, Lagos, Leckie, and Palma. So there is not much chance of the roads being re-opened for some years to come. If the roads are to be re-opened at all, it must be by shot, shell, and rockets, or by blockading them. The natives, instead of sending produce, destroy it; whilst vessels here have to leave in ballast. It is a great pity that Governor Glover ever left, as I am sure that, had he been here, he would have opened the roads before this. There is a strong feeling in Lagos in favour of Governor Glover, and even his opponents are beginning to see that they have been de- luded. There is no resource left but force; and the Home Government will be culpable if they neglect to make use of it. Ever since Governor Glover was recalled, both the Lagos Government and its messengers have been treated with contempt, especially by the King of the Je- bus. The British flag has been dishonoured and treated con- temptuously by a few tribes of semi-barbarians, who still hold the power of England at defiance. At first there were only two tribes, the Abeokutans and the Jebus, opposed to the opening of the road, but now the Yorubas have joined; so that, with the exception of Porto Novo, Lagos is completely blockaded for business purposes.' Our correspondent adds that his own con- viction is that a general appeal will be made, both by the Europeans and natives, for the return of ex-Governor Glover, and that the result of Governor Glover's re-appointment will be the opening of the roads into the interior, and the consequent full resumption of trade."
* **THE WEST COAST**: The British and African Steam Navigation Company's Royal mail steamer Sherbro, recently arrived in the Mersey with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa.

At Opobo and Bonny no settlement of the differences had been effected, and trade in consequence was almost at a standstill. H.M.S. Wrangler had gone to Old Calabar when the Sherbro left the river for the purpose of bringing up Consul Hewitt, who had just arrived from England. It was expected at both places that the Consul would be able to settle the points in dispute and prevent any hostilities.

Sir Samuel Rowe, the Governor of the West African Settlements, had returned to Sierra Leone when the Sherbro passed, after an expedition up the Roquelle River to satisfy some unfriendly natives. Sir Samuel, with his staff, had previously been stopped by the natives, and not allowed to proceed into the interior. The natives subsequently threatened to make a descent on the English settlement. The expedition...
51

Just concluded was made by Sir Samuel, accompanied by a force of one of the West India regiments. The enemy on this occasion were not encountered, although the Governor and his force proceeded beyond the place where he had been previously stopped.

The steamer Benin, of the African Steamship Company, with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa, has also arrived.

The Benin brings news of the death of John Jumbo, the eldest son of the well-known African Chief, Oko Jumbo. He had been suffering from ill-health for some time past, and at the time of his death he was on board the Benin, with the intention of going to Grand Canary for the benefit of his health. John Jumbo was one of the best known of Oko Jumbo's sons, and was very much respected both on the Coast and in England. He has been several times in England—indeed, he was educated at the Liverpool College, and was everywhere known as the "African Prince."

Particulars are also brought of the murder of Mr. John Steel Hoyland by the natives at Abinsie. Mr. Hoyland, who was an agent of an English company, visited the river Binue in his launch. The natives in several parts are known to be treacherous, and through their hostility Mr. Hoyland lost his life. According to the information received, the unfortunate gentleman was struck by a poisoned arrow and died soon afterwards. Mr. Hoyland had been on the Coast for nearly two years.
* **Native Rising in Central Africa**: On Dec. 10, Reuter's Agency received despatches from Blantyre, announcing the beginning of operations against the Angoni Zulus, who, in consequence of the news of the Matabele war, made a serious attack upon the south-western portion of the British Protectorate early in October. The Acting Commissioner at once despatched three columns to operate against the Natives. Fuller information from Blantyre, dated Oct. 25, informs us that a very serious attack had been made on the south-western portion of the British Central Africa Protectorate by the Angoni Zulus under Chikusi. The ruling chiefs of this tribe are related to the Matabele south of the Zambesi, and from time to time Matabele refugees have come to this district from across the Zambesi. By this means reports that the British were being worsted in the south by the Matabele spread to the Angoni, and Chikusi (whose territory lies partly within the British Protectorate and partly within the Portuguese sphere) seemed to think he could attack the British with some prospect of success. The slave raids of this chief were stopped a short time ago by the establishment of forts in the Upper Shire district, and as he thus lost much revenue by no longer being able to sell slaves to Arabs and Yaos he has of late been on very bad terms with the British. On Oct. 8, 600 of Chikusi’s warriors entered the Zambesi Industrial Mission station at Ntonda, on British territory, and, after demanding that the station and villages round should be ransomed they burnt villages and killed a number of people attached to the mission. On the same evening another band of 300 armed men occupied the mission station. Following on this, villages near Fort Liwonde on the Upper Shire were raided by Chikusi, and many people massacred.

As soon as the news reached Zamba, Mr. Sharpe, Acting Commissioner, took immediate measures for the defence of the protectorate. On Oct. 20 a column under Captain Stewart was despatched to the frontier, via Liwonde. Another force under Lieut. Alston, was sent via Fort Johnston, and Captain Manning and Sergeant-Major Devoy received orders to lead a third force of Sikhs from Central Angoniland. The three were to converge on Chikusi’s country. At the same time the Acting Commissioner sent information to the Portuguese at Tete asking them to co-operate with the British in dealing with such portions of Chikusi’s country as lay within their sphere. It was computed that Chikusi could put into the field 30,000 warriors, but only some 300 of these are armed with guns. In this case, however, it is not so much the guns that are dreaded as the rush of thousands of men armed with spears and knobkerries, and it is felt that the present enemy is only less formidable than the Arab confederation at the north end of Lake Nyassa was a year ago.
* **Native Rising in Central Africa**: There has been trouble, too, with other Angoni chiefs; and Chiwere, in Central Angoniland, where there are now numerous European settlers, is becoming excited. Blantyre is not very far distant from Angoniland, and means were at once taken to look after its defences.

The column under Capt. Stewart started from Zomba on Oct. 12 and reached Chikusi’s head kraal early on Oct. 21. The force consisted of fifty-eight Sikhs and two hundred Native troops, with six Europeans: Captain Stewart, Lieut. Alston, Corporal Fletcher, Dr. Poole, Mr. Greville (acting Vice-Consul at Blantyre), and Mr. S. Chance, in charge of the 7-pounder mountain gun. The expedition passed a number of villages which had been burnt by Chikusi, where were lying heaps of speared and mutilated bodies. The rebels from

behind cover opened a hot fire, wounding two Sikhs and two Native soldiers; but the fight did not last long; the Sikhs formed up and charged, followed by the Atonga troops, and the Angoni fled. The chief's town was then burnt and a small cannon was captured. Chikusi himself was afterwards captured by a small party under Mr. Greville and brought into camp. After his arrest all sorts of charges of murder and raiding were brought against him, and after evidence had been taken, the Court appointed to try him found that the accusations had been proved and sentenced him to death. He was shot the same evening. Capt. Manning, who joined Capt. Stewart after the fight, set about pacifying the country and building a fort in Lower Angoniland.
* **The Royal Niger Company**: In the spring of 1896 the Company found itself free from international subjects of preoccupation, and its influence was recognised throughout a territory of which the area equals in extent about half the size of British India. For the first time it was free to turn its attention to the internal native affairs of its sphere. From a certain number of the weaker tribes the Company has accepted sovereign rights, giving in exchange a guarantee of protection. A clause in its treaties with stronger powers is to the effect that they shall not raid for slaves in the protected States, and it is essential that the Company shall cause treaties to be respected. The campaign just concluded is an application of the theory in practice. Nupé had entered into a treaty with the Company not to raid in the protected States, and broke its treaty, not only in this but in other respects. The Company has punished Nupé so effectually that it may be hoped the lesson will hold good for all Mahommedan States who find themselves tempted to recalcitrance. The importance of the result of this campaign can hardly be over-estimated. Had Nupé been able to make good its resistance, the British flag would have been driven off the river, the garrisons of the Company must have been recalled from Yola and from Boussa, and the intermediate stations, the frontier lines which it has required years of negotiation to trace between the spheres of Great Britain and Germany and Great Britain and France, would have fallen in, and the Imperial Government would have been called upon to consider whether it was prepared to conduct war on an extensive scale in the interior or to acquiesce in the transference to continental neighbours of a sphere which the enterprise of the Niger Company has acquired and held for British influence.

This sphere, to which the name of Nigeria has been given, promises to become a rich and extensive market of British trade. It is not, like the sphere of the British South Africa Company, suitable for British settlement, but neither is it, like that sphere, the home only of semi-naked natives with few wants. It has been for centuries inhabited by people of high level of civilisation, whose products are very valuable, whose local handiwork is not to be despised, who possess an art and literature of their own, and who share with other inhabitants of the world the tastes and requirements for the gratification of which trade exists. The Hausas of Nigeria number many millions. They are essentially a trading people, and when the barriers which separate them from the outer markets of civilisation have been broken down their contribution to the commerce of the world cannot fail to be exceedingly valuable.

## The rise in human sacrifices under the new King of Dahomey suggests a shift in the political or religious climate, potentially influenced by groups using spiritualism to manipulate the King and maintain traditional practices, with local leaders possibly complicit in these harmful customs.

The claim regarding a rise in human sacrifices under the new King of Dahomey, suggesting a shift in the political or religious climate potentially influenced by spiritualist manipulation, is addressed differently by the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not directly support the claim, as it focuses on Dahomey's economic transition from the slave trade to palm oil production due to external trading pressures, particularly from a French firm. This indicates an adaptation to changing economic conditions rather than a focus on spiritual or religious practices, with no mention of human sacrifices or spiritual manipulation. In contrast, The African Times articles report an increase in human sacrifices during the Sorsi custom under the new King, who executed ninety men compared to the previous King's limit of thirty, suggesting a more extreme approach. However, the articles do not provide evidence of spiritualism or manipulation by groups in Dahomey, nor do they indicate local leaders' complicity in these customs. The mention of spiritualism and manipulation is instead associated with Madagascar, where the King is influenced by superstitious beliefs. Thus, while the articles support the claim of increased sacrifices, they do not corroborate the suggested spiritual manipulation or complicity in Dahomey, highlighting a divergence between the claim and the sources.

* **Political structures**: The Mfecane spread far and wide a new model of the northern Nguni state as revolutionized by Shaka. The new state involved basically the adaptation of the age-grade system to create what was virtually a standing army. This ranged far and wide to recruit young men into the army and women as wives, all at the disposal of the king to whom all resources belonged, including cattle and agricultural produce with which to sustain the army and an expanding court. It also involved acculturation of con› quered peoples into the dominant culture, and an entirely new conception of the relationship between the ruler and the ruled.$^{9}$ The personality of the ruler and the quality of his leadership still seemed to have mattered more than the structures of the state, and the state was often rent apart by the family feuds of the royal lineage. But there is no doubt that for all the initial devastation and confusion created, the Mfecane succeeded in establishing several larger, more efficient and stronger states, with more durable structures than had existed previously. The new states also had more-clearly defined frontiers, if only because they made such demands on the ruled that there could be little doubt about the extent or limits of jurisdiction. The ruler might still exploit his headship of different religious cults but, increasingly, he was ceasing to be merely a ritual leader. His managerial, administrative and military capabilities as effective and execu› tive head of the state machine became more important than the network of kinship and ritual connections, though in some cases these continued to be important as ideology and source of legitimization.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The political organization of Liptako represented an attempt to maintain a balance between the clans, and this was reflected in its very structures. Power was transmitted through patrilineal descent from Saidu, the father of that Brahima who had led the djihäd. However, the Ferrobe eventually decided or agreed that their antagonists, the Torodbe, should constitute the electoral college that designated the amir. The college investigated each candidate's personal qualities, such as justice and piety, as well as the services he had rendered, the extent of his matrimonial alliances, and the like, and finally gave a decision. By means of this participation, the Torodbe, even though they were debarred from wielding power themselves, were placed in a position where they could in a sense decide among the Ferrobe claimants, and this served to integrate them into the system. 43 Once the new amir had been tentatively selected, he was subjected to an interview and asked trick questions. Then animals were sacrificed to the genii and to a sacred snake. A new traditional drum was made, to be included among the symbols of power granted by the Sokoto council. 44 The new amir's head was swathed in a turban by one of the Torodbe in the presence of the chief imam and the kadi, and facing the standard he swore to respect the customs and principles of Islam and to maintain the welfare of his people. This was a ritual of political and religious renewal of cosmic dimensions, designed to appease supernatural forces of all descriptions. The religious authorities were appointed by the kadi of Dori and were invested with judicial power as courts of appeal. In addition, there was a network of village imams, headed by the chief imam of Dori.
* **On the eve of the nineteenth century**: Allowing for differences in detail, the Shona and Lunda states were structured around similar organizational principles. At the apex stood a king believed to have sacred qualities that were either inherent in kingship or acquired through rites of investiture. The ruler's intimate relationship with the supernatural, sanctified by spirit mediums and cult priests, ensured the health and well-being of his subjects and the fertility of the land. The interrelationship between kingship and fertility underpinned the mys› tification of the ruler and reinforced his position as symbolic owner and spiritual guardian of the land. As a result, he retained the exclusive right to allocate land, which was the basis of control over subordinate chiefs and other subjects and underpinned a cycle of reciprocity. In repayment for the opportunity to use the king's land and benefit from his divine prowess, his subjects were expected to provide specified taxes, labour service and tribute that varied from one kingdom to another. Throughout both state systems, moreover, the largest tusk of a dead elephant automatically belonged to the monarch as owner of the land. In some societies, such as Manica, the Lunda of Kazembe, and Undi, the monarch also maintained a theoretical monopoly over commerce, while in Changamire's kingdom the ruler was the ultimate owner of most cattle.$^{5}$ These tribute, labour and commercial arrangements enhanced the power and wealth of the monarch, who redistributed to his principal lieutenants a portion of the surplus which he extracted, to ensure their continued loyalty. In this respect the precolonial central African states organized the flow of scarce resources from the dominated classes to the dominant class. 6
* **The role of religious ideas**: merely as a reaction to exogenous experience but upon the grounds of the viability and adaptability of African religions'.$^{27}$ With this view of African religious systems regularly able to throw up prophetic leadership out of their own tensions and potentialities, and of prophetic leaders able to create new syntheses which simultaneously revalidated the old and allowed for the new, we have moved a long way from the idea of prophetic ideologies of resistance as 'the magic of despair'.
* **The role of religious ideas**: Thus colonial writers spoke of a 'witch' as leading the Giriama rising in the coastal hinterland of Kenya; more recent historians have reinterpreted her as a 'prophetess'. But Cynthia Brantley Smith, in her admirable and exhaustive account of the Giriama, establishes that she was no sort of religious leader: merely a respected and assertive woman.$^{28}$ This is a case in which a retranslation of colonialist terms like 'witch' and 'witch-doctor' is not enough to correct the distortion of official accounts. It has been suggested by two researchers on Ndebele and Shona history that the same is true of my own account of the 1896 risings in Southern Rhodesia; the British South Africa Company said the risings were fomented by 'witch› doctors'; I argued that they were powered by a profound prophetic ideology; Julian Cobbing and David Beach assert that the spirit mediums were of much more restricted influence than I allowed and that the priests of Mwari participated in the risings hardly at all.$^{29}$ It will perhaps not be found surprising that I am unready for such drastic revisions. But it certainly is true that recent work on African religion in Southern Rhodesia shows that its relationship to resistance cannot have been so straightforward as I had supposed. It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements. A prophet emerges in response to a popular sense that there is need for radical and innovative action, but such a popular sense need not arise only because of external threat. A
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.
Nevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast.
* **Religious change**: In the centre of the region under consideration, it was in the nineteenth century that Islam became the leading religion of Dagomba and Mamprusi, as also in Sansanne Mango. Imams were religious and political figures. In Asante, Osei Kwame (1777-1801) was sympathetic to Islam; conceivably he may have been deposed for that reason. Osei Bonsu, for his part, declared, 'the book [Ku'ran] is strong and I like it, because it is the book of the great God'. Bowdich speaks of a thousand or so Muslims in Kumasi under the leadership of Muhammad al-Ghamba, known as Baba, who was the son of the imam of Mamprusi and made good use of his position as a member of the royal council. Muslim traders from the Arab world, of course, flocked into the capital, and amulets prepared by marabouts, especially battle tunics, sold for high prices.$^{67}$ Undoubtedly it is important not to exaggerate the impact of Islam on the traditional religious system of the Asante empire, which in practice was largely identified with the political structure. Nevertheless, its influence was at work, and it did its utmost to keep princes from succumbing to the Christian religion and its missionaries, as was also the case in Buganda at almost the same period.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Social change**: Social change arises naturally in periods of upheaval. This was true of the lands lying in the Niger Bend and the Volta basin in the nineteenth century. While we have few documents on this aspect of the historical process, it appears that social changes were greater in centralized states than in societies in which administration was decentralized, greater in the coastal regions than in the lands of the interior, and greater in Islamized areas than elsewhere. While sedentary societies that did not have a centralized power structure were the most affected by the convulsions of the time, they took refuge in fidelity to their traditional code of life as an antidote to their trials.
The situation of slaves and caste members was much worse in centralized states. The most radical upheaval was undoubtedly the one that occurred in the Fulbe groups: originally nomads under the domination of the Gulmanceba, within a few years after the djiKäd they in turn had become overlords ruling indigenous peoples, or peoples whom they had reduced to the level of commoners, captives and serfs (bellah or remaibe), condemned to the tasks of cultivation and herding. In addition, there were artisans and griots. It was a meticulously stratified society in which every individual had and knew his place. Over and above one-fifth of all plunder taken in raids, 57 the amir of Liptako received gifts and a tribute on harvests that was known as the zakat. Similarly, the chiefs of Jiibo received gifts at 'salutations' and levied a tax on salt for which traders were liable. Aristocrats were sometimes attended by hundreds of dependants. While the conditions of slaves improved with seniority (rimaibe could own property), the status of captives was to raise problems in Liptako. 'Uthman dan Fodio himself advised the amir to free slaves who had taken part in the struggle against the Gulmanceba. Furthermore in 1861 the Amïr Seeku Saalu was confronted by a slave uprising touched off by the marabout Abdul Kadiri, who aspired to seize power. The amir was able to retrieve the situation only by agreeing to manumissions.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: Brahima Saidu, who had been nothing more than the jooro (village headman) of Weedu, a post to which he had been appointed by the GulmancØ chief of Kaola, became an atniiru (atnlr) and launched a holy war, which ended with the Gulmanceba being pushed southward, although extensive regions of mixed population remained. However, the other Fulbe clans (the Tukuloor and the Waakambe) objected to the growing power of Brahima Saidu. They sent a delegation to complain to Shaykh 'Uthmân, who replied that while it was undoubtedly 'preferable to leave power to him to whom God has destined it', he did not see why they themselves had not declared a holy war, inasmuch as they had been established in that 'pagan' environment longer than had the Ferrobe.$^{40}$ Sokoto always put its political and religious influence behind the new dynasty and intervened on occasions, as for example in 1890, to settle disputes between rival claimants to the emirate. In return, the amir of Dori provided Sokoto with little enough: no military assistance was sent, and the yearly tribute in kind (grain, livestock, slaves and cloth) could not be supplied, as often as not, because of the unsafe condition of the roads, especially after the empire was divided up and Dori became subject to the rule of Gwandu. Specifically, the Kebbi rising, and subsequently Arewa and the Zamberma, constituted a formidable barrier. The djihad of Massina on the other hand, had little impact on the chieftaincies of Jiibo and Barbulle, where the influence of the traditional religions prevailed. In addition, although Jiibo and Barbulle paid tribute to Hamdallahi until 1858, they did not regard themselves as subject to the rule of Massina,$^{41}$ perhaps because the latter had no local representative. In practice, at any rate, they enjoyed autonomy. The tribute thus represented an act of deference. It may also have been intended to anticipate any possible attempt at conquest. From the standpoint of Massina, the tribute was presumably the practical expression of its suzer› ainty, which it would have liked to strengthen. An opportunity presented itself in 1858,$^{42}$ in connection with a dispute over the succession in Barbulle.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80**: The Muslim reformers (who included at least one of the last, reforming Hausa kings) had a very different blueprint to institute. The role of the king was replaced by an amir neither whose person nor whose palace was sacred. Allah, and not the state personified by the king, was the source of authority. Consequently the amir was chosen not for any inherited quality of sacredness but for his personal piety towards Allah. The amir was the first among equals; his companions as a group were to share power under the amir's leadership. As a result, the role of palace slave-officials was to be reduced to that of personal servants and the formal office of queen mother or sister was eliminated. The amir was part of the political process, and his office was theoretically open to any suitably pious candidate. A minimal bureaucracy of ministers, judges, inspectors, police and imams was established as prescribed by the blueprint; and the regulations of the sharTa law, following the Mäliki school of interpretation, were to order relations between persons and between groups. The changes were designed to limit and formalize the political processes, to prevent gross manipulation of previously unwritten rules as well as to curtail the growth of palacecentred government. It was intended to do away with the ambiguity of a Muslim wielding ritual authority based on local, traditional religious belief, and replace it with an authority derived solely from Allah, an authority not only acceptable to the Muslim community but also accountable to it. The blueprint's detail is most conveniently set out by 'Abdullah dan Fodio in his book to guide the Kano community on their new constitution, Diyd" alhukkatn.$^{1}$ But as problems arose, Muhammad Bello and subsequent caliphs wrote letters to the various leaders of nascent communities, outlining the crucial elements of the new system and adding some practical details. From one viewpoint, the political and intellectual. history of the nineteenth century can be seen as an extended exercise in trying to implement or modify the reformers' blueprint. From another viewpoint (also implied in the blueprint), it is a history of the development and purposeful integration of the rural economies of the region, and their closer linking with first the Mediterranean and later the Atlantic economies. To these reformers' concerns, there was also added a distinctive sense of urgency and seriousness if the community was to be rebuilt, materially and spiritually, in time for the expected coming of the
* **On the eve of the nineteenth century**: the spread of Mwari must have fundamentally altered the cosmology of the indigenous inhabitants.$^{19}$ Culture change, however, was not unidirectional. Although this problem needs to be studied in depth, it is clear that both the Shona and Lunda conquerors borrowed cultural elements from the indigenous societies, often creating new syncretic forms. The Chewa and Lundu cults of Makewana and Mbona seem to represent such a hybrid,$^{20}$ as does the division between land chief and political chief that characterized the rule of the Lunda of Kazembe over the Shila. 21 By the end of the eighteenth century Central Africa had undergone a dynamic phase in its historical development. Migrations and conquests in the preceding centuries had altered the political and cultural map of the region, while the scale of trade had increased substantially. These changes, in turn, often generated tensions between the dominant and the dominated and between different commercial interests competing for the region's scarce resources. Thus, despite the tendency towards political centra› lization, conditions remained relatively fluid and could be exploited by alien merchants and a new wave of conquering immigrants
* **The main forces of change**: So did the introduction of Christianity which sought to abolish tradi› tional gods and beliefs. Wherever Christianity took root, for instance, many traditional priests and other manipulators of the supernatural had to take to other professions. Slaves obtained their freedom, thus forcing those who formerly depended on slave labour to do their own work for themselves or shift to dependence on wage labour. Lands hitherto reserved for gods and goblins were released either for arable use or for the siting of social institutions like the school, hospital and so on. The younger generations went to school where they learned new techniques which equipped them for employment in government, commercial firms or missions. And since these jobs were available for the most part in urban areas, it means that conversion to Christianity could also imply a predisposi› tion to live in urban areas. Or to take another example, a man could go to the urban area in search of economic advancement while being still staunchly loyal to the traditional religion. In time, however, his physical separation from the shrines and religious rites of his home gods, as well as the economic, social and psychological pressures of the new environment could turn him into a Christian of sorts. These examples of how one social force usually produced a variegated impact could be multiplied many times.
* **The religious background of the reform movements**: Furthermore, Muhammad's prophecy that 'Allah will send to this umma (Muslim community) at the beginning of every hundred years he who will renew her religion for her' was all too well known in the Western Sudan. Indeed, the whole eschatological tradition, bequeathed by earlier gener› ations, had a profound influence on the programmes and actions of the djihäd leadership. The popular appeal of this tradition and the frenzied passions it is apt to unleash are universally acknowledged; for the messianic figure embodied the hopes and aspirations of the masses, and provided what they believed to be a sure way out of a crisis. The expected deliverer is said to have been commissioned by Allah to promote vigorously by the tongue (preaching and teaching) and, if necessary, by hand {djihäd) the Ku'ränic injunction oiamr bil-ma'rufvpal-nahi$^{ l}$an al-munkar (commanding the good and prohibiting the evil). He was to erase unbelief, injustice and oppression; he was to build a better world and attain, for the umma, a satisfying religion.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure**: In the case of Katsina, the original, rather limited lineage-based cen› tralization gave way, in the face of militarism, to an increasingly autocratic palace government. These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.
So far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.
In larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi. The links between these representatives of the local population and the upper levels of the administration were in the hands ofjakadu, servants or agents of the office-holder allocated the responsibility for that section of the population. Similarly, messengers linked the office-holder to his amir. The function of the administration was primarily tax collection, but this was as much a political as an economic act; to pay was also a symbolic act of submission, to refuse payment was a token of rebellion. As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns. Some indication of the administrative work in the late nineteenth century has been preserved in the correspondence which has been kept by descendants of officials in Sokoto, Gombe and Bauchi.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80**: In 1820 the Sokoto caliphate was composed of some seven major emirates with a further ten large emirates still in the process of formation. Borno too was re-established after the retreat from its capital and the loss of extensive areas in the west and south. In order to understand the changes implied by the terms 'caliphate' and 'emirate', let us briefly and very schematically recapitulate the old political system the reformers had replaced.
The most notable feature of the old system was the role of the king, known variously as mai, sarki, etsu, alafin. Before the shifts in power in the late eighteenth century, the king had ritual functions and a role that required a certain seclusion from the public; the palace was more sacred than a mere house. The king was more or less above politics, a symbol of great authority in whose name all acts were done; he represented the state. A number of men and women who as slaves or eunuchs were without kin or heirs were servants dedicated to the palace and the king's person; they formed one section of the administration. Another section was formed by large independent households with hereditary claims to titles, the holders of which thus had their own followings of men. A third section was the family of the king, particularly the king's mother or sister, his brothers and sons. The composition of councils and bodies responsible for rituals or for military leadership varied in detail from state to state, often with the palace slaves and the free office-holders divided into orders through which individuals could move by promotion. Political competition was limited to the offices under the king. As far as we know there were in the late eighteenth century trends for kings to take a more active part in politics, to become more exclusively Muslim and to promote reforms on the lines of Islamic government.$^{6}$ Economically, it seems that it was a period of rising levels of consumption (particularly of cotton cloth) and demand for slaves; and there was a need to regulate the expanding market and protect it. The effects of these changes reverberated down to the trading, farming and pastoral communities in the countryside, as those involved in political competition sought to strengthen their hold on their bases of power; as a consequence of which the ¿jihad found widespread support among the victims of these changes.
* **Religious protest movements**: Not so easy to suppress was the Mumbo cult, a movement contempor› aneous with Ndonye wa Kauti's prophetism which outlasted Ndonye. This movement was rooted in the resentment of colonial authority which the Luo and the Abagusii shared. This resentment dated back to the wars of occupation the British had inflicted on the Abagusii in 1904 and 1908, and on the Luo of Alego in 1908-1 o.$^{7}$ But it was further ingrained because of the British coercion of these people to yield compulsory labour for road construction and for the settler farms. There was, in addition, the hated hut tax which weighed particularly heavily on those who were polygamous. The paternalism of the missionaries further fuelled this mood of resent› ment. As in Ukambani, the Abagusii began to look for new categories of thought that would hold forth promise for a better world view. They found this in the Luo Mumbo cult, a traditional lake spirit cult which was at the height of its influence in the nineteenth century. This cult found revitalization into a political movement for resistance to the white man's presence in the second decade of this century. In an epiphany in 1913 this Mumbo spirit addressed one Onyango Dunde of the Seje clan in Alego as follows: I have chosen you to be my mouth-piece. Go out and tell all Africans - and more especially the people of Alego that from henceforth I am their God. Those whom I choose personally and also who acknowledge me will be forever in plenty. Their crops will grow of themselves, and there will be no more need to work. I will cause cattle, sheep and goats to come out of the lake in great numbers to those who believe in me, but all unbelievers and their families and cattle will die out.
The Christian religion is rotten and so is its practice of making its believers wear clothes. My followers must let their hair grow and never wash. All Europeans are your enemies but the time is shortly coming when they will disappear from our country.
* **The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy**: Perhaps the two best examples of this power shift occurred in the northern states of Undi and Kazembe. In both cases alliances between local mer› chants and foreign traders facilitated the circumvention of the royal mon› opoly and drastically weakened the position of the respective national leaders.$^{68}$ A similar pattern occurred in the kingdom of Kassanje, located in the adjacent territory of Angola. There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74
* **Borno, 1820-80 > The second period, 1855-80: the Borno Shaykhdom**: If this analysis of Borno politics in terms of patron-clientage is correct (and it is the analysis of R. Cohen and L. Brenner), such a system had its origins in al-Kânâmrs use of slaves and a few friends to run his early administration.$^{31}$ Because of the country's divided loyalty, with the older lineages probably following the mat, the Shaykh^ did not take over a hereditary administration; and the deaths of äEtCänärnfs councillors in the disorders of 1846-54 cut short any development in that direction. Members of the man's administration too were discredited after 1846. It is difficult to see, then, what other form of political recruitment Shaykh 'Umar could have used at the time. It may however be an anachronism to treat patronclientage as the traditional Borno system, or even as the dominant system in the early nineteenth century. Al-Känämfs councillors primarily were not his clients but his partners, with a considerable degree of inde› pendence - thus their crucial role in the events following al-Känämfs death. Ministerial dynasties were then still a possible development. I would suggest, after all, that there was a marked political change after the period 1845-55,$^{ Dut on}$e made easier by simply extending over the whole political spectrum the principle al-Kânâmï used in his appointment of slave officials.
* **The new social structures**: In the Gold Coast the leading political party until the ascendancy of Dr Kwame Nkrumah - the United Gold Coast Convention - represented some kind of rapprochement between the new and traditional elites. In places like Ethiopia, Egypt and Buganda where the traditional rulers had responded positively to western influences, no logical conflict developed between them and the new elites. It was the same in societies like that of the Igbo where the traditional elites had not the kind of stature that survived far into the colonial period. In any case the new elites were not all the 'uprooted natives' of imperialist mythology, nor were all the traditional rulers the obscurantist opponents of change of latter-day nationalist demagogy. Both groups had more in common than was often admitted in the evanescent heat of occasional debate.
* **The abolitionist period**: But since the plantation complex varied throughout the Americas the socializing forces within which the Africans and their descendants would mould their own American culture likewise varied. Throughout the Amer› icas, therefore, the amalgam of cultures would demonstrate great variety.
Certainly this can be seen in the modifications which took place in the worship of Shango, perhaps the most widely distributed African religious form in the New World.$^{47}$ While the Nigerian - more specifically, the Yoruba - origin was never in doubt, the forms of Shango varied con› siderably from Cuba, to Trinidad, to Haiti, to Brazil. In Cuba, in particular, the cult became quite Catholicized, and the originally male African Shango became female, while other forms of the ritual as well as the symbols were transposed and, in some cases, transformed. What held true for the worship of Shango also followed in other aspects of community life and organization. It became increasingly more difficult for creóle Africans to maintain their original social forms in the New World, however great their numbers, owing to the development of a structure which had stabilized by the nineteenth century, and to which they were forced to become a part, and to make necessary adaption.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In the palace he, the King, sat just about the same place, but under a large tent surrounded by the Amazons. The chiefs and captains having passed round before the King with their silk dresses, and so on, about one o'clock they commenced passing with the furniture, cowries, and cloths, which are to be thrown to the people some few days to come. Presently came on two of the poor Ayors bound in baskets, each being carried by two of the Amazons. Next came an alligator and a cat, bound in the same way. Next came six of the Ayors. In the same manner a few other things passed, and then came four more, all bound as described, only in cases instead of baskets. His wives were the last, dressed with silks of different kinds.

The cowries, cloths, tobacco, and the other things, except the furniture, were thrown over to his people from a sort of platform on which he goes to stand, and the poor Ayors were thrown from the platform, except two he pardoned. These poor fellows were not criminals; they were people caught in war some time ago, and kept in prison. This custom lasted twenty days, and there were more than fifty killed before I left Kanna for Whydah.

The King was to start from Kanna to Abomey, to hold the Horses' Custom, but the month of September being evil moon to them, no custom must be held in it; so that the custom was postponed to October.

The King started at the appointed time for Abomey. All the Whydah chiefs who had returned home started again for Dahomey. The custom commenced as soon as the Yevoga of Whydah reached Dahomey.

Dahomey has two customs, which come in turns annually. One is Attor, and the other Sorsi. The former is a sort of platform erected (with sticks), on which the King has to sit or stand, to throw things to his people. The latter is a shed supported by several poles, and to each pole people appointed to be killed at a certain period of the custom are fastened one by one. The late King never exceeded thirty men at a time in all the days of his reign.

This latter custom is what is going on now.

Instead of one shed, he made double, one on the other, and ninety men fastened to the poles, and there was not one pardoned—every one was killed.
* **THE REVOLUTION IN MADAGASCAR**: Madagascar is so important an island, and may exert so great a future influence as regards Eastern Africa, that the interesting events which have there taken place demand insertion in our columns. But our limited space renders it necessary that we should curtail the Rev. W. Ellis's admirable account as much as possible.

During the five months in which no intelligence was despatched from Madagascar, the King had evinced certain retrograde and dangerous peculiarities. Mr. Ellis, who writes on the 16th May, says:—

"The King was addicted to many superstitious notions about dreams and spiritual agencies, habitually enforcing any argument with the expression that he believed it, for it was right, because 'God told him so.' Any account of supernatural appearances or phenomena had a peculiar charm for him, much more so than any direct reasoning upon cause and effect."

The persons interested in the continuance of heathen customs took advantage of this. A species of heathen spiritualism was got up.

"A sort of mental epidemic appeared in the adjacent provinces and in the capital. The subjects of this disease pretended to be unconscious of their actions; to be unable to refrain from leaping, running, dancing, &c. They also saw visions and heard voices from the invisible world. One of these visions, seen by many, was the ancestors of the King, and the voices they heard announced the coming of these ancestors to tell the King what he was to do for the good of the country. Subsequently a message was brought to him as from his ancestors, to the effect that, if he did not stop 'the praying,' some great calamity would soon befall him. To the surprise of his best friends, the King was exceedingly interested in this strange movement, seemed to believe the pretended message from the world of spirits, and encouraged the frantic dancers, who daily thronged his house, and declared that the disease would continue to increase till 'the praying' was stopped. It is generally reported that these movements were prompted by the guardians of the idols, and promoted by his own Mena maso,* who bribed parties to come as sick persons in large numbers from the country, in order to continue the delusion.
* **Dahomey**: I should be very glad to see that the country was governed by the English Government, and I believe that all friends and native people would be glad too, because they are in great distress and looking for who can deliver them from such mischief. Don't you despise this information. They do their mischief at night, and that is why things are hidden. The fetish men make human sacrifices, and I believe they do this according to the King's command. I say again, such a country should be taken under English government. With these few remarks I beg to conclude.—Yours,

## The Kingdom of Dahomey uniquely integrated female warriors, known as Amazons, into its military and cultural life, challenging traditional gender roles and European military norms by relying on their bravery and strategic significance in both combat and ceremonial roles.

The Kingdom of Dahomey uniquely integrated female warriors, known as Amazons, into its military and cultural life, challenging traditional gender roles and European military norms. The General History of Africa textbook supports this claim by detailing the Amazons' role as a feared component of Dahomey's permanent army, highlighting their involvement in compulsory military service during wartime. This underscores their strategic significance in combat, although the text does not delve into their ceremonial roles or their impact on European perceptions. Complementing this, The African Times news articles emphasize the Amazons' formidable presence in the military, noting their indomitable courage, strategic importance, and ferocity, often surpassing that of their male counterparts. The articles also highlight their cultural significance through participation in ceremonial customs, such as carrying prisoners and engaging in the King's customs. While both sources affirm the Amazons' challenge to traditional gender roles, they do not explicitly address the broader impact on European military norms, focusing instead on their roles within Dahomey. Together, these observations confirm the Amazons' integral role in both combat and cultural life, though they leave some aspects of their influence on European perceptions unexplored.

* **Conquest and reaction in French West Africa, 1880-1900 > Dahomey**: Behanzin, the king of Dahomey (Abomey), like Samori, chose the strategy of confrontation in defence of the sovereignty and independence of his state.$^{30}$ Direct conflict occurred during the last decade of the nineteenth century when France declared a protectorate over Porto Novo, a vassal of Abomey. This move constituted a serious blow to the economic interests of Abomey. In 1889, the heir to the throne, Prince Kondo, informed the governor of the RiviŁres de Sud, Bayol, that the Fon people would never accept such a situation. In February 1890, Bayol ordered the occupa› tion of Cotonou and the arrest of all the Fon notables in the town. Prince Kondo, who had begun his reign in December 1889 under the name of Behanzin, reacted by mobilizing his troops. At the time, Abomey had a permanent army which, in peacetime, numbered 4000 men and women. In wartime military service was compulsory for all males, supported by the Amazons, who were dreaded female warriors.
The French garrison was attacked at dusk, at the same time as part of the army dispatched to the region of Porto Novo set about destroying the palm trees. According to Behanzin, those economic counter-measures quickly induced the French to sue for peace. On 3 October, Father DorgŁre presented himself in Abomey with proposals for peace. In return for the recognition of Cotonou as a French possession and the right of the French to levy custom duties and station a garrison of troops there, the French were to pay Behanzin an annuity of 20000 francs. The king accepted these terms and the treaty was signed on 3 October 1890. However, to defend the rest of his state, the king started to modernize his army. Between January 1891 and August 1892 he purchased, '1,700 rapid-firing rifles, six Krupp cannon of various bore, five machine-guns, 400,000 assorted cartridges and a large quantity of shell'$^{31}$ from German firms operating in Lome.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the political field**: A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R. E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'. '$^{6}$ Indeed, as will be seen in the next volume, as a result of their repeated and often unnecessary and unjustifiable interventions in the politics of independent African states, those armies have become the heaviest of the millstones round the necks of African governments and peoples.
* **The collapse of Old Oyó**: The wars and their social effects culminated in the development of a new society; and this gave rise to the need to fashion new methods and styles of government. The new situation made for the emergence of warriors as the dominant class and the eclipsing of the pre-existing monarchical class. This is particularly true of the Yoruba area where the obas lost control to the baloguns or warlords. The experiments with military dictatorship in Ijaiye under Kurumi, federalism in Abeokuta under Sodeke and con› stitutional monarchy in Epe under Kosoko illustrate the efforts in nine› teenth-century Yorubaland to fashion new constitutions appropriate for the political management of the new society generated by the wars.$^{28}$ The eventual adoption in the twentieth century of the Yoruba-style gba-ship institution by some of the Aja communities within the Nigerian region exemplified the continuing nature of this cultural adaptation process. 29
* **Military systems**: established the model of the king as war leader. He alone con› stituted the age regiments and organized their training, discipline, pro› visioning, and equipment as professional warriors. He redesigned the war implements, and depended on local manufactures for such equipment. The army became the core of the state. Many a general seceded with portions of the army under his command, roamed over wide expanses of territory as he recruited more followers, acquired cattle and women, and eventually used his troops to impose his rule over different communities of people, thus creating a kingdom. The main advantage of such professional warriors was not so much their armament as discipline, training and provisioning. Even where they had to live off the field, the requisitioning was organized and did not degenerate into looting. The most successful of such standing armies in Africa in the nineteenth century depended on local resources for their training, equipment and generalship. This was in contrast with those that sought to model themselves on European armies in terms of uniforms, barrack life, drilling and titles. In the case of Madagascar, reforms even went as far as the purchase of rank, and other early nineteenth-century European practices.
* **The collapse of Old Oyó**: It has been customary to state that Oyo responded to this development by sending an expeditionary force under one Balogun Ajanaku but that the Oyo army was routed by Dahomey. The truth, rather, seems to be that Qyo in the 1820s was hardly in any position to send any worthwhile army to deal with a rebellion in a place as distant as Dahomey. Research has, in fact, shown that rather than being an official Oyo army, the force that Ajanaku led against Dahomey in the early 1820s was more probably a joint Sabe-Ketu affair.$^{23}$ It was made up of Yoruba and Mahi troops and Ajanaku himself, although often described as a balogun (warlord) of Qyo, has been more reliably reported by local Fon traditions to have been an indigene of Sabe. This military initiative fell within the familiar pattern of military alliances which Yoruba and related communities, who had enjoyed the protection of Old Oyo vis-à-vis Dahomey, came to form to defend them› selves and conduct pre-emptive attacks against their common enemy once Oyo was no more.$^{24}$ In any case, Ajanaku's men were defeated and he himself was captured and executed by Gezo.
* **Military systems**: One major effect of this growing importance of European firearms was the relative decline of cavalry as the elite and striking force in areas where it had been important and its replacement by a European-style armed infantry. In the forest areas and in places influenced by Nguni warfare, the traditional elite was already the infantry. Here the main trends of the nineteenth century were the training and increasing professionalism and subsequent introduction of European armaments to this infantry. In the widespread movement of peoples, such as followed the Mfecane or the collapse of the Old Oyo empire, sometimes a people in a scrubland area hitherto depending on cavalry moved into a more forested area where cavalry warfare was difficult, and this further encouraged the decline of cavalries. Some of the states in direct confrontation with European settlers, having a tradition of mounted riflemen, bred ponies for fast movement, organized importation of European arms and created new armies that for a while had the balance of power on their side. In much of the rest of Africa and especially the Sudan, where for centuries the cavalry had been the core and the elite of the armies, trained, professional foot soldiers armed with rifles rose to become the elite force. The cavalry was beginning to be relegated to the second line of defence and reserve. This sharpened the revolution in the military systems in Africa and had important social and economic implications that all helped to strengthen the ruler as the chief executive of the state.
* **The collapse of Old Oyó**: In c. 1800, the most important single power and the one that held sway over most of the lands and peoples of the Mono-Niger region was the Old Oyo empire.$^{6}$ While the core area of this renowned Yoruba state hardly extended beyond localities situated between the Osun and Ogun river basins, the territory from within which tribute came and over which discernible military, political, economic and cultural influence or control of varying degrees was exercised was approximately the western half of the area covered by this chapter.
In the extreme west, the Aja state of Dahomey was reduced to tributary status in 1748 after a series of Oyo attacks from c. 1740, and it remained so until the early 1820s; Porto Novo had been similarly reduced when it was secured by Oyo as its main port for the export trade in slaves.$^{7}$ The route linking this port and Oyo ran through the areas of the Egba and Egbado sub-groups of the Yoruba who had to be controlled by Oyo imperial authorities through the posting of Oyo state officials (ajele) to such strategic Egbado settlements as Ilaro and, later, Ijanna. Culturally and economically, the Egba and Egbado areas were also intensely penetrated by the Oyo: there were Oyo settler colonies and Oyo traders actively engaged in commercial activities in the area.$^{8}$ Ketu and Sabe, two other major Yoruba sub-groups and states in the west, preserved traditions of political autonomy, but they also maintained cordial relations with Oyo and benefited from the overall protective influence of the empire. Eastern Borgu, like the south-western parts of Nupe, equally acknowledged the authority of the alafin (king and emperor) of Oyo. In all of these areas, which fell within the geographical 'gap' mentioned above, Oyo cavalry could operate because of the relatively open country, and Oyo agents evidently enjoyed relatively easy access and communication.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.
Nevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast.
* **The Mono-Niger area as the unit of analysis**: There are four main distinct, though evidently interrelated culture areas, comprising the Aja in the west, the Yoruba in the centre, the Borgu (pronounced Bohu) in the north and the Edo in the east. As is to be expected, each of these main culture areas is subdivided in terms of such sub-cultural traits as dialect, ecology and specific occupation. The Ajaspeaking peoples$^{1}$ are in three principal sub-groups, made up of the Fon who dominated the ancient kingdom of Dahomey; the Gun of the Werne river valley and the Porto Novo-Badagry region astride the southern end of the present-day border between Nigeria and the People's Republic of Benin (former French Dahomey); and the Ewe between the Cufo and Mono rivers in the south-western parts of the Benin Republic with the bulk of their kinsmen in the adjacent areas of southern Togo and south- stern Ghana. North and east of the Fon, concentrated on the Agbome (Abomey) plateau are the Mahi in Paouignan, Savalu, Wese, Dassa-zoume, Jaluku and Kove (CovØ). This group also shares observable Aja subcultural traits and memories of ancestral interconnections.
* **The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance**: A number of African societies also expanded their defensive capabilities through internal military innovations. The Barue developed munitions plants which produced powder, rifles and even components for their artillery.$^{8}$ New and expansive defensive structures such as the fortified town of Jumbe of Kota and the aringas of the Zambezi and Luangwa valley were built to withstand European siege.$^{9}$ Other Africans, among them the Makua, Lunda and the disparate bands who operated in the Gambo region of southern Angola, developed guerrilla tactics that stifled the first imperialist advances. Around the turn of the century Barue, Tawara, Tonga and other Shona religious spirit mediums (svikiro) (see Fig. 8.1) provided divinely inspired medicines to neutralize the European weapons and turn their bullets into water. 10 Despite the common commitment of some of the Africans to prevent foreign rule and to acquire modern weapons, the immediate tactics they employed varied substantially. In several cases African states reacted violently to the first European encroachments despite the overwhelming military advantage which the enemy enjoyed. Thus, the Chewa leader Mwase Kasungu led his people in a futile effort against the British, ultimately committing suicide in 1896 rather than capitulating.$^{11}$ At about the same time the Bihe of Angola ambushed a colonial force seeking to establish interior posts which would cut through their homelands, and the Humbe, to the south, attacked a Portuguese force after Lisbon refused to pay rent for the right to maintain a small fort within its borders. ' 2 Other African leaders sought to avoid initial confrontations in the hope that they could either strengthen their military capacity or negotiate a 'just' treaty in which the sovereignty of their state would be recognized. For almost a decade Gungunyane (Plate 8.2) negotiated with both the British and Portuguese and was prepared to make a variety of concessions short of renouncing Shangaan independence. '$^{3}$ The Barue royal family pursued a similar policy seeking to enlist the support of Karl Peters, a German adventurer, whom they thought had close ties to Bismarck's government, while sporadic Bemba resistance at the end of the century occurred only after fifteen years of diplomatic manoeuvring with Great Britain.$^{14}$ In the most extreme cases, states like Quitanghona in northern Mozambique and the Chikunda empires of the Zambezi valley willingly acknowledged the nominal authority
* **The Ndebele**: Since the Ndebele kingdom was a conquest state, the organization of its vast army significantly overlapped with, and somewhat overshadowed, the political and administrative organization of the state. This army, numbering some 20 000 in the latter years of Mzilikazi's reign, was divided into regimental units, all overseen by regimental indunas or commanders. These in turn were under the supervision of four divisional indunas, with Mzilikazi himself at the apex of the system.
Nearly all adult men formed part of the army, and therefore belonged to regiments. These regiments lived in regimental towns. Married members of a regiment were allowed to live in the regimental town with their wives and servants. They constituted a kind of reserve force that could be called up in an emergency. Sons were enrolled in the same regiments as their fathers. Thus, instead of youths being recruited into a single regiment from all the communities forming part of the state (as was the case among the Sotho-Tswana), membership of a regimental town became hereditary. Occasionally, when population growth warranted it, Mzilikazi would select youths from the various regimental towns to form a new regiment which would be placed under its own induna who would then be permitted to build a new regimental town. Each regimental town was under the supervision of both its induna and one of Mizilikazi's queens.
It is essential to note, however, that while the regimental system operated in this manner for the purpose of absorbing the youth, not all the conquered people lived in the regimental towns. There were ordinary villages of conquered persons leading their traditional life styles in the midst of the whole Ndebele kingdom. But these were generally attached to regimental towns.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: As noted above, there was a marked west-east trend in the migration of Aja-speaking peoples, especially in the second half of the nineteenth century when Dahomey renewed its invasion of Gun and Yoruba states and communities east of the Werne river valley. This led not only to an increase in the size of existing eastern Aja settlements such as Badagry, Ajido and Koga; it also brought about the creation of numerous new settlements in the western and south-western parts of the area of the present-day Lagos State and Ogun State of Nigeria. 35 A similar colonization movement was in evidence further east. In Yorubaland, for example, there was a remarkable interpØnØtration and mixing of the several sub-ethnic groups. Here the most spectacular effect was produced by the Oyo, whose diaspora began in the first two decades of the century when the forces of instability were unleashed on the capital of the old empire. By 1830, the main centres in which Oyo migrants settled had included Ibadan, Ijaye and present-day Oyo town, north of Ibadan. However, it was Ibadan imperialist expansion between the 1840s and 1860s that led to the full flowering of the Oyo diaspora. As a result, several Oyo communities moving in from the north-west were established among the Igbomina, Ijesa, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ikale and Ilaje sub-culture areas of eastern and south-eastern Yorubaland.$^{36}$ Conversely, eastern Yoruba groups such as the Ekiti and Ijeça came as captives or freedmen to Ibadan and several other settlements in Osun, Ijebu and the Egba areas in the west and south. In Borgu the Fulbe djihäd brought about a population movement southwards into the Yoruba culture area comparable with that of the late sixteenth century when the fall of Songhay caused a similar pressure by the Mande from the north.$^{37}$ The nineteenth-century movements streng- thened the existing network of interpØnØtration between Borgu and such north-western Yoruba communities as the Oyó, Sabe and Ketu.
* **New political trends**: its army on the lines of a Western army and adopted Western techniques and methods but also set up factories to produce modern guns and other military equipment. Ethiopia under TØwodros and Menelik also abolished its unpaid levies, replacing them with a well-equipped army of professional soldiers and set up factories to produce cannon and mortars. Finally, Samori Ture also reformed and modernized his army and equipped it with some of the latest weapons of the day. It was these reforms that enabled both Samori Ture and Menelik to hold out for so long against the imperial powers during the last two decades of the century. However, as some of the later chapters will show, this modernization process was undertaken through loans raised mainly in Europe at high interest rates, and this prepared the ground or provided the excuse for the imperialist takeover at the end of our. period.
* **Al-Hadjdj 'Umar and the army of the mudjahidün**: This fanatical army often faced a disunited enemy. This was so in Bambuk, Kaarta, Segu and Massina. It was also clearly superior in military strategy: e.g. diversionary manoeuvres, encirclement of the enemy, rapidity of movement and all the military techniques that had enabled the Prophet and his caliphs in a few short years to conquer vast territories. Even terror became a strategic weapon: the massacre of men and the enslavement of women and children$^{92}$ broke the morale of threatened countries and led some to surrender without a fight. When approaching a country, the procedure was always the same: emissaries were sent to the chief to invite him to convert; if he acquiesced, his head was shaved and he was handed a string of prayer beads (satala) and taught the elementary rules of Islam. The procedure was the same for his subjects. A taUb and a small garrison were left to consolidate this conversion. This recourse to peaceful con› version saved them many battles, some of which could have been difficult. Thus the redoubtable citadel of Farabana was invested without much resistance in 1854. In 1856, too, al-Hadjdj 'Umar showed himself very conciliatory towards the people of Farabugu, who had revolted; and after the capture of Dyangunte in the same year he did not hesitate to negotiate with the Kamori to get them to conform to the Muslim rules about the possessions of the defeated.$^{93}$ It was only when people refused to embrace Islam that battle was joined. Unfortunately this was what most often happened.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: In the west, the predominantly Catholic and lusophone Brazilian Africans initially found a more congenial cultural environment in Porto Novo and Whydah, where they had been preceded by an older 'Brazilian' community founded by Brazilian Portuguese slavers who had to withdraw entirely to the Aja coast in consequence of the British anti-slave trade naval action further east. The eventual substitution of French for Portuguese control of the area of the Gulf of Benin west of the Werne still left a residue of Latin culture sufficient to make Brazilians prefer this to the eastern coast, where Latin cultural influence was destined for eventual extinction. Consequently, it was in the area that eventually became French Dahomey that is the western parts of the region under discussion - that Brazilian Africans made their greatest impact. Not only did they co-operate with the French in the latter's successful bid to conquer Dahomey and create their new colony: Brazilians also ranked first and foremost in the colony in taking full advantage of French colonial education, thus making them a crucial factor in the growth of Dahomey as the 'Quartier Latin of French West Africa'. 45 However, this dichotomy in the locational focus of the impact of Saros and Brazilians must not be interpreted as contradictory to the overall development of the Mono-Niger region as an integral whole. Strong feelings of community based on specific kinship ties and general historical and cultural affinities among descendants of the da Silvas, the d'Almeidas, the Dos Regos, the de Souzas, the Pedros, the Martins, the Pereiras and so on, whether in Lagos, Whydah, Agwe or Porto Novo, warn against such interpretations. Indeed, the continuous recognition to this day of the relationship between West African Brazilian families and their original Brazilian bases, particularly those in the state of Bahia, makes the Brazilian connection an illustrious example of the essential unity not only of the history of Africa but also of the vital communication between the continent and the black diaspora.
* **The Sotho**: shots and specialized in sudden attacks on their victims. The Basotho responded by organizing counter-ambushes and night raids on the camps of the Griqua and Koranna bandits. They killed the people and captured their horses and guns. In time, the Basotho bred an indigenous horse, the 'Basotho pony' and turned themselves into 'a nation of mounted gunmen'.$^{80}$ This was a tremendous development in defensive nation-building.
* **The Niger delta > The western delta**: The Itsekiri kingdom of Warri (Ode Itsekiri) was the most important political and commercial centre within the western delta from the fifteenth century to the early nineteenth century. The more numerous Ijo to the east and west of the Itsekiri did not develop centralized polities of a size to offer effective competition. In the immediate hinterland, the Urhobo and Isoko were also largely organized in decentralized communities, and served as the producers and suppliers of slaves and, later, palm oil and palm kernels to the Itsekiri middlemen. However, up to the nineteenth century, the Itsekiri kingdom itself was known to the European visitors as merely a 'principality' of the Benin kingdom. Accordingly, early traders to the western delta usually went up the Benin river to the port of Gwato (Ughoton) where they dealt with the agents of the qba of Benin.
From about the late seventeenth century, direct Benin influence began to fade in the western delta, and European traders began to use ports within the Niger delta on the Benin, Escravos, and Forcados estuaries. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, several Itsekiri chiefs had moved from Warri (Ode Itsekiri) to establish trading posts on the Benin estuary, and soon the Benin port of Gwato (Ughoton) ceased to be a centre of the overseas trade. Throughout the nineteenth century, then, the Itsekiri were the effective leaders in the trade of the western delta, and Benin had to receive supplies of European goods through them.3 Benin tried to maintain political dominance over the Itsekiri kingdom, and demanded a form of tribute in trade goods from the Olu of Warri, on pain of the closure of the hinterland trade routes. However, Olu Akengbuwa was able to defy the oba of Benin, to the extent of giving asylum to a dissident Benin chief. But when Akengbuwa died in 1848, his subjects believed him a victim of the qba's curse, which was also thought to have kept the Itsekiri without a ruler from 1848 to 1936.
* **Conclusion**: It seems possible to divide the Mfecane states into several categories. There were the aggressive militarist-offensive states. The Zulu, Ndebele and Gaza kingdoms appear to have been fairly good examples of this genre. To this group may also be added the various Nguni states of the transZambezi region. These states, which employed the military machine to conquer and subdue others, tended also to rely on the edge of the sword or the barrel of the gun to maintain the allegiance of subordinate polities. Their expansionist or imperialistic policies required that they keep pro› fessional or semi-professional armies on a permanent basis in 'barracks' or military villages. Regiments were required to embark on regular tax- or tribute-gathering expeditions at outlying parts of the kingdom. These armies were built on the age-regiments, which in the Ndebele and Zulu cases were the essential instruments for the absorption of conquered youths. The Gaza state did enrol conquered youths in age-regiments but kept these segregated from those of the 'Nguni' youths, even though the regimental leaders were drawn from the conquering ruling group. Thus in the Gaza state, the regiments did not contribute to building national unity. Because of the blatant discrimination against the 'ba-Tshangane', as the conquered Tsonga were called, they were not assimilated into the Gaza state. This, more than any other factor, accounted for the weakness of the Gaza conquest state and its ultimate collapse under the Portuguese onslaught. Conquest states tended to draw their state bureaucracies from commoner and military rather than royalist members. In the Ndebele state, regimental commanders not only supervised their regiments but also together with one of Mzilikazi's queens represented him in their regimental town.
* **Conclusion**: Mzilikazi, Sobhuza, Zwangendaba and Sebetwane. As Omer-Cooper cor› rectly observed, these men
demonstrated not only courage, powers of leadership and military skill but [also] the capacity for original thought and action; the ability to devise or adopt new institutions and new techniques to solve new problems; the statesmanship to rise above a narrow tribal point of view. They demonstrated the capacity of the Bantu to respond to challenges and that the traditional tribal education had a far less cramping effect on the development of human personality than some have supposed. 107
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities**: Regiments were variously armed, with a few men mounted on horses or camels; the majority were armed with spears, bows and swords. Certain peoples specialized in archery, particularly with arrows poisoned to make up for the lack of penetrating power; others specialized in barbed spears. Swords were less common and, unless made of particularly good local iron io. Specific studies on military affairs are: J. P. Smaldone, 1977; R.C.C. Law, 1980 (but cf. R. Harris, 1982, pp. 81-5). The outline presented here, particularly in putting less emphasis on the military's role, differs somewhat from the analysis in these two books. J. Boyd has kindly drawn my attention to the formation of a special caliphal bodyguard first formed f.1850 as much, it seems, for external as for internal security (Alhaji Junaidu, 1957, p. 54). No study has been made of strictly palace formations and security, though references are frequent. ' '.'·.... or of imported steel, were seen as a potential liability. Guns did not become available in any significant quantity until towards the end of the period; then they tended to be the weapon of privately maintained, semi-pro› fessional (and therefore slave) forces, but their comparative lack of practice prevented them from being formidable. As in the eighteenth-century states, the most effective weapon of the caliphate was its cavalry. Initially the reformers in the djihad had lacked horses or camels and were thus at a disadvantage against the Tuareg or the forces of the Gobir states. But cavalry had little success, not merely against the determined soldiery of the djihad, but also against walled towns or mountainous strongholds. The history of the caliphate's major campaigns records many defeats as well as victories, and smaller, wholly mounted contingents were probably much more effective. There was, therefore, a tactic quite distinct from the setpieces battles known as daga and which resulted in high casualties - the common raid, hari, on the civilian population. Given the heterogeneous, highly mobile character of Hausa society, with its traders, slaves and refugees, it was easy to plant spies and infiltrators in an unwary community and take the place by surprise.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In the palace he, the King, sat just about the same place, but under a large tent surrounded by the Amazons. The chiefs and captains having passed round before the King with their silk dresses, and so on, about one o'clock they commenced passing with the furniture, cowries, and cloths, which are to be thrown to the people some few days to come. Presently came on two of the poor Ayors bound in baskets, each being carried by two of the Amazons. Next came an alligator and a cat, bound in the same way. Next came six of the Ayors. In the same manner a few other things passed, and then came four more, all bound as described, only in cases instead of baskets. His wives were the last, dressed with silks of different kinds.

The cowries, cloths, tobacco, and the other things, except the furniture, were thrown over to his people from a sort of platform on which he goes to stand, and the poor Ayors were thrown from the platform, except two he pardoned. These poor fellows were not criminals; they were people caught in war some time ago, and kept in prison. This custom lasted twenty days, and there were more than fifty killed before I left Kanna for Whydah.

The King was to start from Kanna to Abomey, to hold the Horses' Custom, but the month of September being evil moon to them, no custom must be held in it; so that the custom was postponed to October.

The King started at the appointed time for Abomey. All the Whydah chiefs who had returned home started again for Dahomey. The custom commenced as soon as the Yevoga of Whydah reached Dahomey.

Dahomey has two customs, which come in turns annually. One is Attor, and the other Sorsi. The former is a sort of platform erected (with sticks), on which the King has to sit or stand, to throw things to his people. The latter is a shed supported by several poles, and to each pole people appointed to be killed at a certain period of the custom are fastened one by one. The late King never exceeded thirty men at a time in all the days of his reign.

This latter custom is what is going on now.

Instead of one shed, he made double, one on the other, and ninety men fastened to the poles, and there was not one pardoned—every one was killed.
* **THE ASHANTEE WAR**: Report says that the Ashantee army at Assim has been removed to reinforce the Akim army, and that a new expeditionary force has been sent down to Assim. These troops have done nothing whatever. They have remained stationary, and seldom fire a shot, although they are constantly molested by the scouts of the Fantees. I have hitherto said nothing of what we ourselves have been doing. No sooner did the intelligence of the engagements at Essechoomah reach head-quarters than the Major commanding the troops was ordered by the Governor and the Commander-in-Chief to march in that direction. They found great difficulty in obtaining carriers for ammunition and rations for the men. Women and boys were employed. At the review parade at Anamaboe, held by Major Cochrane, there were about 400 Regular troops, and about 70 Volunteers. Our little army looked cheerful and in high spirits. The 2nd West India Regiment looked remarkably well, and spoke with delight of the coming struggle. They marched for Mankassin at noon on the 19th April. They remained some time at Mankassin, owing to want of carriers. A portion of the troops was detached under Captain Brownwell to Winnebah, to assist the King, and organise the native

force. Subsequently, another detachment, making in all 100 men, under Captain Williams, was ordered to join Captain Brownwell. The troops at Mankassin pushed on to the place where the Ashantee army is reported to be stationed, and a battle is now daily expected to take place. While the Major attacks the Ashantees in front, Captains Brownwell and Williams are to act on their rear.

Interior from Anamaboe and Cape Coast there is a large army collected at a place called "Monsoo," composed of the Fantees—viz., Accras, Assins, Denkeras, Cape Coast, and Anamaboe. His Excellency Governor Pine has appointed Captain Wood, Receiver-General of Revenue, to be commander of the combined force at Monsoo. The Governor has conferred on Captain Wood the temporary title of major. Major Wood has left for the scene of action.
* **DAHOMEY**: Mr. Consul Burton, not aware that he would be selected by Her Majesty's Government for a mission to the King of Dahomey in November next, as announced in our general observations, has made a visit to Abomey on his own account. He was supposed to be on his return to Whydah when the last mail steamer left the coast. He merely reports that his reception had been a very favourable one, and diminishes the number of the Amazon soldiers to about 2,500.

Mr. William Craft was still at Abomey.  
We expect interesting intelligence for our next number.
* **CAPE COAST.**: 

There is a ditch outside the wall of Abeokuta, which makes the wall very difficult to mount. A Dahoman column of 3,000 advanced from the Aro side of the town to within fifty yards of the walls, at about seven a.m. on the 15th March (the anniversary of their appearance last year). Many thousands of Egba muskets now opened upon them from the top of the wall, which is fifteen feet high. This at once checked the general advance; but some of the Amazons justified their previous reputation by scaling the wall in face of such fearful odds and with certain destruction as the result. The Iwe Irohin says (copied almost literally by "An African," as before mentioned): "One of these ferocious women had already had one of her hands cut off in endeavouring to get over the wall, when she discharged her musket with the other hand and killed an Egba; but at the same moment she received a severe cut with the sword, so that she fell back into the trenches." "The fierce struggle lasted about an hour," during which there was a continual roar of musketry, "when the enemy retired a short distance, being unable to stand the fire of the Egbas any longer." The loss of the Dahomans during this first hour seems to have been nearly 200 killed, seventy of whom were in the trench or ditch. "The wounded were numerous, and were removed by the enemy, but many of them afterwards died. The work of destruction among the Dahomans during this hour was frightful. The battle was by this time pretty well decided, and Abeokuta saved; as soon as the enemy retired from the walls, the Egbas rushed out and renewed the battle in the open field. The Egbas fought nobly; they knew what they were fighting for; all depended on this day; if defeated, they have no friends near; they fought for their homes, their wives and children, their country, their liberty, and their lives. For many years past the Dahomans had carried destruction and slaughter into the Egba territory; they came now to make an end to the Egba tribe. The Egbas were exasperated, and each wanted to do his duty on this day. The men fought in good order, though they had only a few leaders; the women were singing and dancing, being sure of victory. They carried plenty of water and agidis to the camp to refresh the fighting men; many of them armed themselves with swords and kept near the walls in case their assistance should be required. A sharp fire was kept up for about two hours near Aro, the enemy gradually retreating and leaving great numbers of dead behind them. They retired towards Ibara, which town they had destroyed last year. At Ibara the Dahomans sought to make a stand, but could not, and many sought safety under cover of the thick bush there. They were greatly distressed for water; all the watercourses were dried up; the dust and heat of a midday sun, with a forced retreat, soon demoralised them. They were attacked in the flank by another party of Egbas, and lost many of their carriers, one of their cannon, and several hundred of muskets, many of which were quite new. Some miles beyond Ibara they had their encampment, which was evacuated; here the pursuing Egbas captured the King's horse and many other things belonging to him. Great numbers of prisoners, men and women, were taken all along the road; and in this encampment the second cannon was captured. Beyond Ishagga, a town which they destroyed two years ago (also on the 15th March), the Dahomans stood once more to check the Egbas in pursuing them. A severe encounter took place, in which several Egbas were killed and wounded, but the Dahomans had heavier losses, and were driven from the field, the Egbas still pursuing them closely, killing and catching many of them. It appears that the Dahomans had never before experienced such a total defeat. It is difficult to give the exact number of dead and of prisoners. From Abeokuta to Ishagga, a distance of about fifteen miles, above 1,000 dead were counted, whilst beyond that place it is said that the number of dead was still greater. The prisoners cannot be fewer than 1,000 or 1,200, some say above 2,000. The Dahomans were probably above 10,000, but one captive states that their number was 16,000. Thus the Lord has frustrated the diabolic plan of the Dahomans to capture Abeokuta, and many of the heathen recognise the hand of God in this complete defeat of their enemies. The people rejoice greatly and congratulate each other on their escape. The Lord God of Hosts said: "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed."

* **The Dahoman Defeat before Abeokuta**: There can, we think, be no doubt that this was the last attack on Abeokuta by the Dahomans that history will have to record. It appears from the report of one of their Sierra Leone prisoners who escaped after the action (and who has been many years captive at Abomey) that the army numbered 14,000, including carriers. It was in four battalions, under the chiefs "Migen," "Mewu," "Ajawo," and "Topo," each entitled to a stool, flag, and umbrella, as signs of dignity. The army left Abomey on the 24th February. They travelled twelve days from six a.m. to two p.m., resting at intervals eight days, thus reaching Abeokuta 15th March.

The King himself crossed the Ogun at Aro, and was not far from the wall of Abeokuta during the first advance.

Though the only four Dahomans who entered Abeokuta were women, the great majority both of killed and captives are men.

By the last accounts a large additional slaughter of the Dahomans had been made at a narrow and deep river, the Yewa, where a pursuing party of Abeokutans found from four to five hundred in a state of such complete exhaustion, that all were slain on the spot.

* **BADAGRY**: By reports from Badagry we learn that the King of Dahomey returned very much crestfallen from his Abeokuta expedition. His corps of *Amazons* is said to have been almost destroyed. He sent messengers to his towns to announce that "he had fired upon the Abeokutans, and that the Abeokutans had killed many of his people, but that his people also killed very many of them." It was generally understood by this, that he had made a bad expedition. He took some small place, however, before returning home, so that he might bring a few slaves with him, which he did. But he decided not to hold the annual Kannah Custom this year, in consequence of his defeat. He has, however, summoned the towns to send deputations to him to the Customs at Abomey, in November.

A very strong desire is expressed that Commodore Wilmot should again visit the King. It is thought that much good might be done with him now. But only by the Commodore, who is a great favourite.

Our correspondent writes hopefully of the future. He thinks that progress in the right direction is being made. We hope he is not mistaken. We cannot overrate the importance of bringing Dahomey under the influence of civilization. It is not alone that the slave-trade would then disappear from the Equator northward, but that according to all reports we have received, Dahomey is, next after the Niger Countries, one of the best and most promising fields in Africa for the production of cotton. We therefore look forward to the day when that part of the Coast, now called the Slave Coast, will obtain the honourable name of the Cotton Coast.
* **ASHANTI WAR PREPARATIONS**: October 1.—A hundred leather bags, to contain from 10lbs. to 20lbs. of gunpowder, for bursting gates and blowing up stockades, were shipped in the Bonny yesterday, for the Gold Coast. Rockets also, which from their imperfect range and accuracy are little esteemed in wars amongst civilized nations, are being sent out in great abundance. A great number of Hale's rockets, which are fired without sticks, are being sent out in the steamer about leaving Woolwich. When fired from a tube or trough they preserve their pivot upon their longer axis by jets of fire, which escape from holes which surround the base, and cause them to rotate, and when they are spent a shell explodes, completing the havoc which their fiery flight has begun. The breech-loading revolvers, which most of the officers will wear, carry a half-ounce bullet with force enough to kill at sixty yards, and they can be loaded and fired at the rate of forty rounds per minute. Canteens, or drinking flasks, with straps for the shoulder, were sent on board the Bonny yesterday afternoon, to the number of at least five thousand, and took up all the room there was left in the main hatch. A portion of the "pickled" sleepers for the railway were also got on board, and the Engineers, when they arrive at their destination, will find all the materials and tools ready to begin their work. They have with them hydraulic jacks and present lifts, and a chest of gimlets, each half an inch thick and two feet long, and are presumed to be for the same service. It is a noteworthy, though perhaps an accidental circumstance that all the men selected in the Engineer squad are unmarried. In the Royal Laboratory men and boys are still busy manufacturing buck-shot and bullet ammunition, and eighty additional hands are to be taken on to-day. An order has been received for nine millions of ball cartridge for the Henry-Martini rifle, and there is no doubt that this order has come in connection with the preparations for the Ashanti war.
* **DAHOMEY NEWS**: **LAGOS, June 23.**—The news is that the King still refuses to pay the fine inflicted by Commodore Sir W. Hewett. He is, moreover, said to have given orders that none of the foreign or European merchants should be allowed to go away from Whydah, as he finds white man is white man, and what will happen to him the resident merchants must share in.

**CAPE COAST CASTLE, June 26.**—The Admiral in command of the French fleet proceeded on the 18th inst. to Whydah, where Commodore Hewett is daily expected. Great excitement prevailed in Whydah on the 1st instant; the place being full of armed men, and a body of Amazons having encamped on the Abomey road, near the town. The authorities allow no one to leave, and had the blockade commenced it was intended to capture all the white men, to plunder the factories, and then decamp.

**GOLD COAST, June 28.**—Whydah, the principal seaport town of the kingdom of Dahomey, has been garrisoned by the famous "Amazons," the *élite* of the Dahoman army, in expectation of an attack on that place by the British. The King believes he will be able to prevent the English landing any force at Whydah; and as for an invasion of his capital, he scouts the very idea of such an impossible event. It is said that the King has been induced to take this step by his European advisers in Whydah, who flatter themselves with the idea that the English will decline to fight with women until it will have been too late for them to have discovered that the Amazons are not women, but she devils.
* **OLD CALABAR.—ELECTION OF A NEW KING. CEREMONY AND FESTIVITIES.**: Prince Duke being selected as successor to the late King Archibong, as Sovereign of Old Calabar, the ceremony of coronation, with attendant festivities, took place on the 30th July, public notice having been previously given throughout the district. A very large number of spectators assembled round the space which is set apart for coronations and other important celebrations. The scene was of the most animated description, the roofs of the surrounding huts being crowded with eager and excited natives long before the proceedings commenced. The festival proper began in the afternoon, the morning being occupied with the firing of guns and the shouting of the people. The dancing was carried on entirely by the men, the "music" being supplied by the spectators, who kept up a continuous and most hideous noise by tapping their mouths with the palms of their hands, yelling and shouting all the time to the utmost of their power.

* **The West Coast**: Private letters from Lagos announce that in the middle of May last, the King of Dahomey made an incursion with an army of six thousand combatants, among whom were his famous battalions of Amazons, into the neighbourhood of Porto Novo, which is under French protection. After destroying ten large villages, among which were Parko, Gume, Pakrio, and Ingo, the invaders massacred all the men and women of a certain age, and to have taken away as prisoners, destined to serve as human sacrifices, about one thousand young men, women, and children. By a semi-official Note sent to the Paris Press through the Havas Agency, it is stated that the Minister of Marine has received from the Resident at Porto Novo no official communication concerning the invasion of that territory by the troops of the King of Dahomey. At present the Minister has only heard of the matter by private letters and by the account sent to the Government by the French Consular Agent of Lagos. A small French garrison is at Porto Novo, but it would have, if attacked by the bulk of the Dahomey army, to get into the fort, and remain there until reinforcements were sent out. The French Government through the Temps, says it has received no information about the incursion unless through the Consul at Lagos and private sources, nor can it at once obtain answers to the demand sent to the military commander at Porto Novo, telegraphic communication being wanting.

Recent advices report that at Massamedes, on the coast, a very valuable vein of almost pure copper has been discovered at a distance of about fifty miles from the port. It is stated that the neighbourhood is very rich in minerals, and that several copper mines are in close proximity to Massamedes.

At Kinsembo trade has been seriously interfered with, owing to a war between the chiefs of Quibo and Kacungo. The prisoners captured by either side were cruelly tortured and then beheaded. The natives have a superstitious objection to burning the heads of their victims, and the result is that they always behead their prisoners first and then destroy the trunks by fire.

News from Ambrizette reports that the Portuguese war ship Reine de Portugal had gone there to settle a dispute between the natives and one of the English trading houses there. It appears that some little time ago two of the natives were caught stealing, and they were detained by the representatives of the English firm until the King was disposed to investigate the matter and punish the offenders. The natives, however, effected a rescue. About four hundred of them surrounded the factory, and amid threats of personal violence they broke into the premises and carried off the two prisoners. The English firm thereupon made a claim for the value of the property stolen and damaged, and the Portuguese war vessel proceeded to the port. At latest accounts the dispute had not yet been settled.
* **Serious Troubles at Porto Novo**: Recent news from Lagos, *via* Paris, reports that Porto Novo, which is under French protection, is in a state of consternation, and the European traders are clamouring to be protected. That region has been suddenly invaded and harried by the King of Dahomey. The invading army is reported as numbering about ten thousand men, including the Amazon corps, which led the attacks. They fired ten important villages and some trading stations, killing all the elderly people, and carrying away all the able-bodied and children. This incursion is ascribed to a religious motive. The Amazons have depopulated the districts bordering on that of Porto Novo to appease the hunger of the evil spirits, who, the priests teach them, feed in some mysterious manner on those sacrificed to them. They have therefore, in their dread of their maleficent divinities, been emboldened to invade a territory which, being under French protection and enjoying an immunity from the sacrificial tax, is thickly populated. Sometimes as many as eight hundred human beings are offered up at Dahomey as a hecatomb. The most robust female children taken prisoners of war are reserved for the Amazonian corps, which now amounts to 4,000. They are entirely consecrated to martial purposes, and obliged under capital penalty to remain vestals. A gallant who causes an Amazon to forget her duties is smeared with honey and tied to a tree to be devoured by insects. These female warriors are more ferocious than their military brethren. They often sacrifice to Bacchus. Their King is nearly always drunk.
* **FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.**: The French have evidently a very difficult task before them. If the new King persists in remaining in the interior with his prisoners, and refuses to treat for their release, it is clear that the French Government will be forced to take serious measures to protect the lives of its subjects. M. Etienne's speech in the Chamber of Deputies recently was a model of what a Ministerial explanation under such circumstances ought to be. This is not a case of more or less imaginary Kroumirs or Black Flags, whose depredations afford an excuse for an act of aggression and conquest. The King has repeatedly attacked the French stations on the coast, and although his forces have been repulsed, he declares he will not rest till he has driven the strangers out. Moreover, a French missionary and five civilians have been seized at Whydah and carried up the country, where, if not rescued, a horrible fate awaits them. All this points in only one direction, and Europeans may at any time hear that the kingdom of Dahomey is condemned to disappear as an independent State. That the Ffons can hope seriously to resist a French force is out of the question. Imbued though they are with savage ferocity, the Dahomeyans are no match for disciplined troops and machine guns. Indeed, of late it is affirmed that the reputation of the people for brute courage is no longer so well deserved as of old. But they are bloodthirsty and vindictive, and reckless of their lives when roused. They may give the French a great deal of trouble, and as women form the backbone of the Dahomeyan Army, it must be an unusually repulsive duty for the "Grande Nation" to enter into hostilities with them. Its Amazonian warriors and the bloody "customs" are the two characteristics of Dahomey which have kept it so prominently before the eye of civilisation. The country itself is of little value. Abomey, the capital, is situated about sixty-five miles from the coast. Whydah, the only seaport of any consequence, is the part of the kingdom with which Europeans are best acquainted. Here there are trading forts and "factories" belonging to the English, French, Portuguese, and Brazilians, which were places of importance during the days of the slave trade. Then the barracoons were crammed with human chattels, while the King was hunting down the neighbouring tribes in order to keep up the supply of that "black ivory" from which he derived such ample wealth. When this traffic came to an end, Whydah sank into insignificance, and is now simply a place of some 12,000 inhabitants, from which palm oil is shipped when the surf permits communications between vessel and shore. Abomey has about the same number.
* **FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.**: Four times in the history of the country have the British been compelled to blockade its coast line. The last of these occasions was in 1876, in punishment for Gelele's ignominious treatment of a British subject in Whydah, and his refusal to pay the fine in palm oil imposed upon him. But this stoppage of trade really injured the Europeans more than it did the natives. The rout suffered by his troops at Abeokuta kept him moderately quiet until some months before his death. Mission after mission was despatched to him, but little result came of these. Instead of abolishing human sacrifices, he usually offered to entertain the envoy with a spectacle of this hideous description; he lamented that the interference of the white men with the slave traffic compelled him to kill his prisoners once a year, as he had really no other way of disposing of these incumbrances! As a matter of fact, the "customs" still continue, and not infrequently the Europeans in Whydah are ordered to come to Abomey in order to witness this dreadful spectacle. Nearly forty years ago the king's Army was estimated at over 10,000 men and 2,500 women; but fighting women now probably amount to 5,000. These are the dreaded Amazons. They form the flower of the troops, taking the post of honour on the flanks of the army, and fighting with a ferocity which quails at nothing. In the hands of Europeans, the country might be productive; for the soil is rich and capable of growing all tropical products. Gold is known to exist, while maize, guinea corn, cassava, yams, sweet potatoes, plantains, oranges, pineapples, ginger, sugar-cane, and a host of similar crops grow freely. Cattle, sheep, and goats live, but are not plentiful, and fowls are scarce. But it is doubtful whether such a region is fit for European colonisation. Whydah might be occupied, and a Protectorate extended over the rest of the country. But Whydah is an open roadstead, so that it is not an ideal spot, while the susceptibilities of Portugal, which has for long regarded this place as almost its own, and four years ago was on the eve of formally annexing it, must be gravely considered by any other Power.
* **The War between France and Dahomey**: The following passage from the letter of an officer at St. Louis, Senegal, gives an idea of Dahomey warfare:—

"Benezin, the present King, who when Prince was called Dong Ko, has at his disposal about 20,000 warriors, male and female, of whom 12,000 are regular troops. The Dahomeyans are very brave. They are divided into companies of about 100 men. Their guns, fortunately, are not of the best quality. They are not afraid of approaching within 90 metres of us. The first row discharge their weapons, the second row then pass their weapons to the first and load the weapons which the latter have discharged. They load their guns to the muzzle with iron balls and with bits of glass and old iron. What is curious is that the barrel does not burst at the first shot. The Amazons, of whom there are 2,000, are of indomitable courage. Care, however, is taken to intoxicate them before going to battle. Recently in an engagement the Amazons charged our troops, who were drawn up in a square, as many as eight times. We had fifty wounded on that occasion. What makes these Dahomeyans more dangerous is that they do not attack during the day; they wait for the night. . . . It is generally the French traders who supply the Dahomeyans with powder and muskets."

A despatch received at Paris from St. Louis, Senegal, dated June 8, states that the rearguard of Colonel Archinard's column had been attacked at Kale by 4,000 natives, under Ah Mahdon. The latter were defeated and put to flight after severe fighting.

* **THE FRENCH EXPEDITION AGAINST DAHOMEY.**: “News of the expeditionary column has been brought here during the night from the Upper Ueme. Two days after the capture of Cana and after the wounded had been sent to the coast and a convoy of troops and munitions of war had arrived, the troops resumed their march on Abomey. On the 13th the squadrons of the Spahis reconnoitred the outer line of the defence and dislodged a small number of Dahomeyans, who were lying in ambush a few hundred metres from the wall. Some of them were taken prisoners, and they were afterwards interrogated by General Dodds, to whom they affirmed that Behanzin had only 1,200 men with him, of whom a large number were priests who had fled from Cana. These fanatics had excited the Dahomeyan soldiers to such a point that the whole body had sworn to die to the last man rather than give in or flee into Togo when the capital was attacked. Indeed, Behanzin is practically a prisoner, and has been threatened with death if he endeavours to shirk his responsibility as commander.

“General Dodds has received a long letter from the King, which was brought to the camp by a female warrior, and in which Behanzin states the terms on which he will capitulate. The principal condition he makes is that France shall abandon the whole of the coast with the lagoons comprised between Kotonou and Porto Novo, while he offers to pay General Dodds the sum of 15,000,000f. to cover the expenses of the present campaign. It is thought by the wounded soldiers just arrived here, however, that Behanzin would find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out these conditions, for it is now highly improbable that the soldiers remaining with him will allow him to give up the struggle.

“The capture of Cana has produced great satisfaction in the Egbas country, where for a number of years past the natives have suffered from the periodical incursions of the Dahomeyans. When they heard of the fall of Cana, a grand thanksgiving fête was celebrated at the market of Abeokuta.”

Paris, Nov. 14.

The steamship Tibet, of Marseilles, has been chartered by the Government for the transport of 1,000 soldiers, who are to relieve General Dodds’s column, which has been two months in Dahomey, and cannot remain longer than three on account of the climate.

## The militaristic and brutal nature of Dahomey society, characterized by the capture and sacrifice of war prisoners, ritualistic violence, and severe human rights abuses, underscores the reliance on warfare and traditional practices for maintaining power and resources.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the militaristic and brutal nature of Dahomey society. The textbook does not explicitly address the claim regarding Dahomey's engagement in capturing and sacrificing war prisoners or ritualistic violence. Instead, it highlights Dahomey's economic transition from the slave trade to palm oil production, emphasizing the use of war captives as labor, which suggests an economic adaptation rather than a focus on ritualistic violence. The text also discusses broader regional changes, such as new social structures and governance emerging in response to warfare, without specifically attributing these to Dahomey. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim of Dahomey's militaristic and brutal nature, describing the capture and sacrifice of war prisoners, known as "poor Ayors," as part of customary rituals. The articles also mention the "Horses' Custom" and the execution of individuals during the Attor and Sorsi customs, illustrating ritualistic violence. The involvement of the Amazons, a female military regiment, underscores the militaristic aspect of Dahomey society. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the reliance on traditional practices for maintaining resources, focusing more on violent customs and the execution of war prisoners. While the articles provide a broader context of violence in West African societies, they do not specifically address Dahomey's reliance on warfare for resources, highlighting a divergence between the two sources in their portrayal of Dahomey society.

* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.
Nevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast.
* **The collapse of Old Oyó**: The wars and their social effects culminated in the development of a new society; and this gave rise to the need to fashion new methods and styles of government. The new situation made for the emergence of warriors as the dominant class and the eclipsing of the pre-existing monarchical class. This is particularly true of the Yoruba area where the obas lost control to the baloguns or warlords. The experiments with military dictatorship in Ijaiye under Kurumi, federalism in Abeokuta under Sodeke and con› stitutional monarchy in Epe under Kosoko illustrate the efforts in nine› teenth-century Yorubaland to fashion new constitutions appropriate for the political management of the new society generated by the wars.$^{28}$ The eventual adoption in the twentieth century of the Yoruba-style gba-ship institution by some of the Aja communities within the Nigerian region exemplified the continuing nature of this cultural adaptation process. 29
* **Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels**: Besides the Asante and Lobi gold, the left bank of the upper Black Volta witnessed, especially in the nineteenth century, an extraordinary concentration of gold diggers of various origins: Dyan, Dagara, BoboJoola, Bwaba and Mossi, in addition to the indigenous Gurunsi. Using only crude implements (picks, hoes, earthenware jars, calabashes and pans), they extracted the gold. As only men could 'see the gold and kill it', the system of division of labour in force assigned men the tasks of prospecting, digging, and crushing quartz, while women were responsible for orecarrying and washing operations. By the end of the century, the proportion of slaves among such communities was substantial (sixty per family in the village of Pura).51 The noteworthy feature here is that these were family or individual enterprises, unrelated to any centralized state. The Zamberma invasion led the peasantry in some villages in the gold-bearing district to conceal their implements in the hills and go on to a war footing; captured men were sold for 100 000 cowries, and women captives for double that sum. In some respects, evidently, gold production and slave-hunting were incompatible. Armed raiding groups, however, naturally preferred slaves, since they were much more profitable$^{52}$ and in addition were also used in washing the gold. During the first half of the nineteenth century, as much as 50 kg of gold may have been produced annually in the Pura region alone."
* **Political and institutional upheavals > Summary**: In addition, the captives which these kingdoms needed as a form of currency with which to buy rare goods and the instruments of war were being carried off at a rate which was becoming less and less compatible with the survival of the societies concerned, especially when they were seized from peoples already subject to tribute, since that depleted the reserves of the dominant powers. Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.
In these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism. However, the Islamic successor states were themselves ephemeral, for they were victims of the same objective conditions that had already doomed the autonomous development of the African states.
* **Some consequences of the d[ihads**: In general, traditional power and social standing were transferred to a new elite, the mudjahidun. Since the Fulbe had formed the backbone of the fighters, they tEus became the aristocrats par excellence of the Western Sudan. They filled most of the administrative positions, and many of them were settled on land alienated during the course of the djihäd. Fulbe and other landowners depended on slave labour to farm their agricultural holdings.$^{56}$ It seems that the proportion of slaves to freemen in the caliphates remained at the high level it had reached in pre-dßhäd days. Slaves who had participated in the djihâd were freed, but those who had not gone over to the shaykhs were re-enslaved. More slaves were secured in raids across frontiers and" in rebellions. The legal status of captured slaves was spelt out in œv&fatwa (legal opinion) of al-Maghïlî: As for one you find in their [unbelievers'] hands, as a slave, who claims to be a free-born Muslim, his word is to be accepted until proof is established to confirm that he is a slave ... Any person you leave from among them, because he claims that he is a free-born Muslim, then it becomes evident to you that he was unbeliever, enslave him again. 57 All individuals and groups within the caliphates were afforded protection and security. The southern movements of pastoral groups were regulated to minimize tension between them and the peasant communities. Northern frontiers and pastures were constantly watched to restrain Tuareg raids.
And slave-raiding within the communities was stopped. SkarTa courts were established and kädis (judges) were appointed by the caliphs and the amirs. Many un-Islamic practices were banned. For example prohibition on drinking of alcohol was strictly enforced; the hated taxes of the discredited regimes were replaced by the canonical zakät (tithe), kharadj (land tax), and djizya; the number of wives was restricted to four, etc.$^{3}$^ Taxes were allocated and collected by the amirs who, more often than not, levied them arbitrarily.
* **The Sotho**: shots and specialized in sudden attacks on their victims. The Basotho responded by organizing counter-ambushes and night raids on the camps of the Griqua and Koranna bandits. They killed the people and captured their horses and guns. In time, the Basotho bred an indigenous horse, the 'Basotho pony' and turned themselves into 'a nation of mounted gunmen'.$^{80}$ This was a tremendous development in defensive nation-building.
* **The strategy of the conquest and the response of the northern Sudanese**: Ignoring the traditional Sudanese taxation system, the Coptic financial intendant liana al-Tawïl imposed heavy taxes on the peoples of the Gezira and Berber in 1821. But they rose in violent protest in February 1822, attacking and killing members of the isolated detachments of Egyptian troops. From Shendi to Sennär the people fled by the thousand to the borders of Ethiopia, to the valley of Atbara and to the region of Gedaref. To avoid a large scale revolt, Ismä^, Muhammad 'Alfs son and his com› mander-in-chief in Sennär hurried back from Fazughli to the Gezira. Through conciliation and a revised assessment of the taxes, he temporarily calmed the situation. But Ismä^ himself soon committed a disastrous blunder. On his way from the Sudan to Egypt, he stopped at Shendi, and demanded an outrageous contribution from the Ja'liyïn people: 30000 dollars and 6000 slaves within two days.$^{19}$ Nimir, the mak (chief) of the local Ja'liyïn, protested that his people could not afford what was demanded. Ismä^ arrogantly hit Nimir across the face with his pipe. To avenge this humiliation, Nimir conspired with his men to burn Ismä^ and all his staff alive at Shendi in late October 1822. Subsequently the revolt spread to other regions and caused extensive loss in life and property.$^{20}$ Though a rising of despair, without proper leadership, this revolt was an early warning to the invaders that resistance to their rule was entrenched in the hearts of many Sudanese.
* **Society and environment**: The arid environment has encouraged the evolution of similar uncentralized political systems among most nomadic people, systems that balance the need for dispersal in the search for pasture with the necessity of unified action in the face of an outside threat. These societies, which have been described in the anthropological literature as segmentary lineage systems, place each person in a series of widening and overlapping descent groups that are larger the more distant an ancestor is chosen as a point of reference. 4 Genealogy can be used to divide a society into x number of maximal segments, each of which is in turn divided into y number of segments and z number of clans, on down through intermediate levels to the extended family. Societies organized according to descent may resolve internal con› flict without recourse to central authority if the power of segments at an appropriate level in the genealogical structure is in balance, and the history of these societies often exhibits this mechanism in operation. But history also demonstrates that segments may unite to face an outside threat, and that military exigency may even give rise to something resembling central authority. Sedentary or semi-sedentary people have often assimilated nonkin who migrated to their territory, and in these societies residence in the same territory may replace kinship as a principle of association. Even societies that are organized according to descent may have leaders or councils at various levels in the segmentary structure or distributed throughout it; wealthy men may attract followers who are not kin; or alliances may contradict or partially offset the notion of kinship as a determinant of allegiance.
Another similarity among Saharan people was hierarchical social struc- ture, a consequence of the power of warriors to concentrate wealth so as to reinforce their own position of dominance. A common pattern was that lineages of aristocratic warriors controlled groups of free but politically subordinate people, the descendants of conquered nomads. People of lower status, slaves or the descendants of slaves, worked as servants, herders, artisans, trade specialists, or farmers.
* **Somaliland**: The Somali people had for long had a deeply-rooted common sentiment of Somali nationality, accentuated by a virtually uniform national culture, and reinforced by a strong adherence to Islam.$^{31}$ Like both their predeces› sors and successors, the inter-war Somali nationalists appealed to this national identity in their struggle against Italian, British and French imperialism in the respective Somaliland territories (see Fig. 4.1).
Besides this underlying factor, there were other forces at work too. They related to the social innovations that colonialism had introduced into the Somali social fabric. Colonial forces had, in fact, destroyed the traditional social and political institutions and imposed their own. They introduced in all parts of Somalia a centralized system of administration that vested all effective powers in the hands of colonial administrators, and gave no Somali any position of command except at the very lowest level. Colonial appointed chiefs, known as akils in the British Protectorate and capos in Italian-ruled Somalia, operated in an advisory capacity only, and as vehicles for colonial directives to the people. This was indeed a wide departure from the traditional free local institutions and the nomadic way of life to which the Somali people were overwhelmingly dedicated. With their fierce sense of independence and traditional disdain for all foreign elements, especially white Christians, the Somali people were bound to resist this radical innovation.
Before the colonial era, the Somali were not subject to government imposts other than qadi fees and import and export duties. But the colonial powers campaigned to mobilize and exploit all Somali resources - human and material - using their newly-appointed chiefs who had no regard for traditional authority. Direct taxes were instituted for the first time in Somaliland. While in Italian Somalia this took the form of an annual hut tax, in the Protectorate the British imposed taxes on lifestock. Moreover Somali labour was forcibly recruited for colonial enterprises. The French recruited 2000 Somali to work for them as manual labourers during the First World War. Of these, 400 were killed and another 1200 were wounded.$^{32}$ Italian administrators sent out frequent expeditions to provide the required labour for their plantations in Somalia. These Somali recruits were grouped according to their ethnic origins and forced to live in colonial villages on the consortiums. All this hardship and exploitation produced a widely-felt sense of resentment to colonialism.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities**: Regiments were variously armed, with a few men mounted on horses or camels; the majority were armed with spears, bows and swords. Certain peoples specialized in archery, particularly with arrows poisoned to make up for the lack of penetrating power; others specialized in barbed spears. Swords were less common and, unless made of particularly good local iron io. Specific studies on military affairs are: J. P. Smaldone, 1977; R.C.C. Law, 1980 (but cf. R. Harris, 1982, pp. 81-5). The outline presented here, particularly in putting less emphasis on the military's role, differs somewhat from the analysis in these two books. J. Boyd has kindly drawn my attention to the formation of a special caliphal bodyguard first formed f.1850 as much, it seems, for external as for internal security (Alhaji Junaidu, 1957, p. 54). No study has been made of strictly palace formations and security, though references are frequent. ' '.'·.... or of imported steel, were seen as a potential liability. Guns did not become available in any significant quantity until towards the end of the period; then they tended to be the weapon of privately maintained, semi-pro› fessional (and therefore slave) forces, but their comparative lack of practice prevented them from being formidable. As in the eighteenth-century states, the most effective weapon of the caliphate was its cavalry. Initially the reformers in the djihad had lacked horses or camels and were thus at a disadvantage against the Tuareg or the forces of the Gobir states. But cavalry had little success, not merely against the determined soldiery of the djihad, but also against walled towns or mountainous strongholds. The history of the caliphate's major campaigns records many defeats as well as victories, and smaller, wholly mounted contingents were probably much more effective. There was, therefore, a tactic quite distinct from the setpieces battles known as daga and which resulted in high casualties - the common raid, hari, on the civilian population. Given the heterogeneous, highly mobile character of Hausa society, with its traders, slaves and refugees, it was easy to plant spies and infiltrators in an unwary community and take the place by surprise.
* **Purposes and impositions of colonialism**: In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official. However, the most peculiar and inequitable element in the French system was the indigØnat.$^{23}$ First employed in Algeria in the 1870s, this device was imported into French West Africa in the 1880s and remained institutionally operative there as well as in Algeria until the end of the Second World War. Regularized by a decree of 1924, it allowed any French administrator to impose a punishment of up to fifteen days gaol sentence and a fine for a series of infractions ranging from failure to pay taxes on time to displaying discourtesy to French officials.
More pervasive in effect than the legal systems were the personal taxes which all African males eventually encountered. Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy. By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime. Between the wars there were attempts to graduate this tax on a regional basis or on an assess› ment of the potential yield of the land. Lastly, there was the income tax, introduced in the 1920s into several British territories and the Belgian Congo, but then primarily affecting non-Africans who generally were the only ones with sufficient income to be required to pay it.
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities**: In short, the caliphate did not introduce any new strategy or military technology, nor did it possess any overwhelming advantage beyond the size of its potential resources; and these were never mobilized all at once. Guerrilla warfare, brought about by the displacement of peoples after the djihäd, by food shortages due to the dislocation of agriculture, or simply by the profits to be made from the sale of captives, plagued the caliphate for much of the century. Too much can be made of the insecurity, but at least in some areas the expectation of becoming a slave at some period in one's life was high.$^{11}$ Ransoms could be arranged, prisoners freed, a captive might even escape, but if, as often happened, the whole family or village was broken up in a raid, there was little to return to. Trade was seemingly not much affected by warfare, though certain areas might get cut off. Trading expeditions were armed, while for some traders their staple was to supply armies with horses and weapons in return for prisoners to take away and resell at some distance from their home.
Given the military limitations, diplomacy was an important aspect of caliphal policy.$^{12}$ The caliphs appear to have handled most of the diplomatic correspondence themselves. No state visits by the caliph took place, nor was any senior member of the caliph's staff sent on embassies overseas. Instead passing scholars, pilgrims and traders acted as bearers of messages, and brought news of political developments abroad. Correspondence was exchanged with Morocco, Tripoli and Britain, and was preserved: but no doubt much more important exchanges were conveyed orally or have been lost. But Muhammad Bello's interest in external relations was as much intellectual as commercial or political. Keen and able to keep up with developments, ideas and inventions in North Africa and the world beyond, he was concerned to bring the caliphate more fully into the metropolitan Muslim world. At the same time, with his concern for the world's approach› ing end and the possibility of having to migrate east to Mecca, he tried to ensure that the road be kept open, and appointed a distant kinsman of the Shaykh to oversee the Baghirmi section of the route.
* **The Makhzen at the beginning of the nineteenth century 2**: In Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli the state - the Makhzen, as it was traditionally called - took the form of a politico-military structure that was marginal to the main body of the society subject to its rule. The men who held the reins of power thought of themselves as being different from their subjects: Turks, who were assimilated in varying degrees in the Regencies, and sharlfs in Morocco. Within these circles, the highest offices were assigned tö mamlüks: former slaves of Christian origin who had been converted and suitably trained to serve at court or in the army. The mainstay of these regimes consisted of foreign military bodies, largely Turkish janissaries. The main instruments of control of the Muslim society were drawn from outside its ranks and from other countries: hard currencies (Spanish piastres, in particular) obtained by seaborne trading activities or by priva› teering; 'modern' weapons and specialists in their use for the army; writing paper and book-keeping techniques (applied by Jewish accountants) for the 'administrative' services. However rudimentary these instruments may appear to be in comparison with those then used in Europe, they proved to be highly efficient in societies that were unfamiliar with them. The Makhzen represented a half-way stage between European or Turkish 'mocíirnity' and the 'traditionalism' of local societies. The Makhzen was able to dominate the local societies and exploit them to its own advantage, sharing the profit to some extent with the notables in the cities and European merchant capitalists, for it was the latter who supplied the money, weapons, paper, etc. and carried away the produce from the countryside. Exploitation of this kind was responsible, to a large extent, for perpetuating the 'archaic' state of inland rural societies, if not for their actual decline. 3
* **The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities**: But diplomacy and warfare aside, the commonest instrument of policy in inter-state relations was economic. Military destruction of crops or grain stores was only one aspect. Particular groups, such as the Tuareg, might be refused access to markets, to certain commodities (like grain) or to wells. Given the local annual variations in rainfall, such bans could be very effective. Less effective were embargoes on the export or import of items such as horses, weapons, salt or types of cloth, while an indiscriminate blockade of towns or areas was difficult to sustain, not least because smuggling offered high profits. But the disruption in the normal flow of caliphal trade caused for example by Ningi and Mbutawa raids was serious enough to require a remedy. Indeed their own experience of severe food shortages and the interruption of the grain trade during the djifiàd had made men like Muhammad Bello acutely aware of the importance of encouraging traders by keeping roads open, establishing markets and enforcing the laws regulating fair trading. In consequence, as the caliphal economy became relatively more efficient and neighbouring peoples depended more heavily on caliphal trade and traders, economic policy was increasingly a more effective instrument of power than warfare.
* **Means of control and administration**: Whatever the variety of theories and methods of colonial domination suggested and implemented in the period between the two world wars, an emergent pattern of bureaucratic rule is evident. By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.
As its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.
* **Stages of resistance > The failure of African initiatives and resistance**: and Islam lays down strict rules for people's wars. Contrary to the idea common in the West, the djihâd as understood in recent centuries is defensive: that is, military service and the taxes that flow from it are only compulsory for everyone if the country is the victim of aggression. In the case of an offensive war (and there have been none in North Africa for centuries), contribu› tions and service are only voluntary. In the circumstances of the nineteenth century, this left the military initiative to the invader. Defence of the realm was traditionally one of the provisions of the bay'a (sovereign's investiture contract). In the event of attack, were Muslims supposed to organize resistance themselves immediately, or ought they to await the sultan's instructions? The question has been discussed at length by the doctors of law, and the view that prevailed was that responsibility should be left to the sovereign so as to stop demagogy and extravagant promises. This explains why, when French or Spanish soldiers appeared in a district, as they did in Tuât in 1864 and 1890 or Tarfaya in 1885, the inhabitants sent a delegation to the Sultan and then awaited his orders. Responsibility was thus left with the sovereign; and he was in a dilemma, for if he held aloof, he jeopardized the legitimacy of his authority, and if he replied favourably to the request, the powers would hold him responsible for anything that happened. Usually he advised calm, delegated a chief to maintain order, and allowed those involved to hope that the problem was being solved through diplomatic means (which many of those on the spot were all too ready to believe).$^{40}$ Here we come to the heart of the matter. When the Sultan failed,$^{41}$ and a religious or lay leader felt obliged to take up the banner of the djihäd in his stead but without his blessing, he would certainly not get unanimous support. The colonial powers could then play on all kinds of rivalries and hostilities.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance. In some cases, the Dyula community became thoroughly assimilated into the local community. Such instances of total assimilation were rare, but I. Wilks, in his informative study,$^{36}$ points to one example - the Tagara of Jirapa in north-western Ghana. The process was insidious enough. As already discussed in the case of the funeral rites of the Koumina canton, the Africans retained their custodianship of land, both physically and ritualistically, so that while, in the towns, contacts with the French and Islamic 'civilizing' missions, demonstrated undeniable advantage for the converts, the seasonal 'commuting' between land and city itself displaced 'unsecured' groups and individuals. Such was the fate of the Dyula.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: It would appear that basically contending interests penetrated the Western Sudan zone of West Africa during the colonial period, the colonial or European and the Muslim represented by the Dyula. The conditions for this resided in the social structure of the people of the Western Sudan. The traditional caste system of the Western Sudanese, which recognized the authority of skilled craft groups over the related materials and geographical territory of their craft and its practice, accorded to the iman or alim (Islamic intructor) a monopoly of authority over the province of literacy, writing and communication, and also indirectly over commercial relations that developed with European colonialism.
* **The Sudan > Mahdist resistance to colonial rule**: Mahdism was one of the early weapons that the Sudanese used in their struggle against colonialism outside the metropolitan province around Khartoum. Both the militants and the neo-Mahdists had, in their own ways, opposed colonial rule during this period.
* **Changing relations with the outside world**: of nature a whole new set of economic uncertainties. Consequently, every tribe and qsar, indeed every group, large or small, with shared interests in resources, was obliged to weigh its response to the French army against the effects, for better or worse, on its economic well-being. The crisis produced not an adjournment, but an intensification of the struggle to outwit the environment, as cooperating groups and individuals sought simultaneously to protect their vital resources and to avoid unconditional submission to the advancing army. 13 Dunn observes that the ideology of kinship could form a basis for military unity in the face of an ephemeral outside threat. But it was of little value 'in circumstances where survival depended essentially upon the ability of groups with shared resources to reconcile their politics to their economic interests through a fragmented, contradictory process of attack, compromise, and evasion'.$^{14}$ Although this conclusion is intended for the Dawi Mani, it might well apply to the history of many other Saharan societies.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In the palace he, the King, sat just about the same place, but under a large tent surrounded by the Amazons. The chiefs and captains having passed round before the King with their silk dresses, and so on, about one o'clock they commenced passing with the furniture, cowries, and cloths, which are to be thrown to the people some few days to come. Presently came on two of the poor Ayors bound in baskets, each being carried by two of the Amazons. Next came an alligator and a cat, bound in the same way. Next came six of the Ayors. In the same manner a few other things passed, and then came four more, all bound as described, only in cases instead of baskets. His wives were the last, dressed with silks of different kinds.

The cowries, cloths, tobacco, and the other things, except the furniture, were thrown over to his people from a sort of platform on which he goes to stand, and the poor Ayors were thrown from the platform, except two he pardoned. These poor fellows were not criminals; they were people caught in war some time ago, and kept in prison. This custom lasted twenty days, and there were more than fifty killed before I left Kanna for Whydah.

The King was to start from Kanna to Abomey, to hold the Horses' Custom, but the month of September being evil moon to them, no custom must be held in it; so that the custom was postponed to October.

The King started at the appointed time for Abomey. All the Whydah chiefs who had returned home started again for Dahomey. The custom commenced as soon as the Yevoga of Whydah reached Dahomey.

Dahomey has two customs, which come in turns annually. One is Attor, and the other Sorsi. The former is a sort of platform erected (with sticks), on which the King has to sit or stand, to throw things to his people. The latter is a shed supported by several poles, and to each pole people appointed to be killed at a certain period of the custom are fastened one by one. The late King never exceeded thirty men at a time in all the days of his reign.

This latter custom is what is going on now.

Instead of one shed, he made double, one on the other, and ninety men fastened to the poles, and there was not one pardoned—every one was killed.
* **SUPPLEMENT—Trial of Whobay**: Damoh Moie, in her evidence, states: "Farmah Baggi chopped Babagoomah on the belly on the 14th March last; Whobay, the prisoner, then chopped him on the side with a cutlass." Again: "Babagoomah died; I saw him die the same day." In another part of her evidence, relating to the murder of Patience Peters, this same witness states: "I knew a woman called Patience Peters. I saw her in the hands of the war people on Saturday morning, the Saturday after the Friday on which Gondomah was taken. The war party collected all the prisoners outside to see one another, and I saw Patience Peters; she was a prisoner with a rope round her neck. I don't know who caught her; it was before sunrise that I saw Patience Peters at Gondomah. Patience did not go with me to the war-fence. On the day after this I went to the waterside at Gondomah to wash, and there I saw Patience's dead body with the head off." Further on she declares that from the house in which Sarah Thomas was to where she saw Patience's dead body was forty feet. We must notice here that if Sarah Thomas and Damoh Moie, in company, saw the dead body of Patience Peters on Sunday, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, as stated by Sarah Thomas, then Damoh Moie saw this body twice that day, but she is silent as to this fact, and if it be urged that her silence is not a denial, then we contend that Conolly must have seen it too if he left the wharf at two o'clock, as he says, that same Sunday afternoon. In whichever way the whole evidence is taken it is contradictory and to such a degree as to make it unsafe to hang even a cat on it. Damoh Moie goes on to day: "On the same day Boye was killed we left Gondomah; Sarah Thomas went with us. I talked to her about the murder of Boye; I told her they had killed Boye. We got to the war-fence that same day Boye was killed. I was with Sarah Thomas the whole of the time we were at the war-fence. I slept at the war-fence with Sarah Thomas. We remained at the war-fence twelve days, and every day I saw Sarah Thomas. The war party killed some one at the war-fence; his name was Tuah, he was a man. They pulled the skin from off his head; they did not kill any one else. I did not hear they had killed any one else during the twelve days we were at the war-fence." But as we have already shown Sarah Thomas swears that a woman was killed at this fence whom she mistook for Patience Peters, and that Damoh Moie was present.

She further states that "Patience Peters was killed Sunday, between twelve o'clock and one o'clock in the day. Damoh Moie was not present, but she saw the dead body of Patience Peters. We left Gondomah on the 14th of March, and Damoh Moie went with us to the war-fence."
* **AN EXPLORATION FROM CAMEROONS RIVER.**: "The head men in the river are anxious to be under Her Majesty's control; they are waiting only for King Bell's sanction and co-operation to petition the English Government to be included in the British Realm. They are evidently getting tired of their attempts to govern themselves. Every dispute leads to war, and often great loss of life. They think that if the strong hand of our law were to interfere, they would be freed from the necessity of going to war to punish a murderer or a thief. If it were not for the terrorism of the secret societies, the old customs would not enthral so completely the thoughtful men around us. They are afraid to forsake or expose the absurdities of their heathenish fashions. One man was bold enough, two or three weeks since, to ridicule the famous 'Moonge' fashion. At night his house was surrounded and burnt, and he himself paid the penalty with his life. Tim Akwa (virtually king of our town, his father being so old and infirm) is accounted a very bold man, because he comes to chapel twice every Sunday and sometimes wears a shirt. The prejudice against adopting anything like the habits of civilized countries, is jealously fostered by the Ngambi men or witch-doctors. This state of affairs would be quite altered upon British occupation. Civilization would be at a premium then, and the people not afraid of mending their habits.
* **Cruel Oppression in Old Calabar**: Dear Mr. Editor,—My heart is much grieved with the evil ways of this country; every day it is going from bad to worse. On the 29th ult., Egbo runners, or masked men, perambulated the town, flogging and fining every one that they could catch. The subjects of this injustice did nothing, but the tyrants deem it necessary to maintain their own power to flog and fine innocent slaves. On the 3rd inst., the masked men went out, scattered the market, and seized much goods belonging to the poor people, which they took away. The tyrants in town, Orok and the three Archibong, got a missionary to their own liking to hold a meeting once a week in their yard. The first good result of this meeting was the issuing of a proclamation that all the dogs in town must be killed, because they spoil Orok's ju-ju. As our brave missionary said in church on the following Sabbath, "The poor ignorant heathens in town sacrificed many dogs last week to devils." The tyrants do not like Mr. Ross; they hate him as much as Ahab did Micaiah. After the meeting was over in Orok's yard, and the missionary away, he at once sacrificed fowls to his ju-ju. Archibong Ezo, son of Archibong II., not long ago flogged a woman to death. Archibong Adam, son of late Archibong III., flogged a boy most barbarously, and when the poor fellow was gasping most piteously, he threw him into the mangrove swamp, to be devoured by crocodiles. There is a respectable young man in town, of some property; the three Archibong boys, including the two murderers, put him in chains, and demanded all his people and property. The plea set up for this iniquitous demand was, that Okom Ma traded seventeen years for Archibong II., and six years for Archibong III., for which he never received any wages. This is a strange reward. The judges met to consider the matter, and allowed the boys to have the palaver all their own way. Okom Ma has appealed to Consul Hewett. Up to this time I have not heard that Consul Hewett settled a single palaver on the West Coast, except one in Old Calabar, where he took the part of a European against the natives. I know he does not strike awe into the natives, and command respect, as his predecessor did. I and many other natives most heartily concur with the suggestion of writers in the African Times for July, that Old Calabar, for the benefit of the oppressed, should be placed under British protection, and a petition to the Foreign Office to this effect is contemplated by the natives. The tyrants dread the day of the termination of their bloodshed, oppression, and robbery. British protection would justly deprive the Calabarees of their monopoly of direct trade with the surrounding tribes, which are ten times more numerous than they; would open up the inland country to the benefits of commerce and civilization, and would, undoubtedly, develop trade, as security to life and property always does.—I am, &c.,

## The Kingdom of Dahomey utilized ritual killings and human sacrifices, justified by religious beliefs, as a means to demonstrate power, instill fear, and manage captives, while these practices also served as significant cultural events that engaged both local and European participants.

The Kingdom of Dahomey's use of ritual killings and human sacrifices is documented in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, each providing insights into different aspects of these practices. The General History of Africa highlights the cultural significance of human sacrifices, noting their role in annual customs and the economic motivations behind the capture of slaves for export and labor. However, it does not explicitly connect these practices to the demonstration of power, the instillation of fear, or the management of captives, nor does it mention European involvement. In contrast, The African Times articles provide vivid descriptions of "evil nights" where numerous men were killed, with their heads displayed as trophies, underscoring the ritualistic and religious justifications for these acts. The articles also emphasize the cultural importance of these events, such as massacres held in memory of deceased leaders, which involved local chiefs and European merchants, although the latter refused to attend. While the articles do not explicitly confirm European participation in the rituals, they do support the claim that these practices were used to demonstrate power, instill fear, and manage captives, serving as significant cultural events. Together, these sources offer a nuanced view of the Kingdom of Dahomey's ritual practices, highlighting both their cultural and religious dimensions.

* **The collapse of Old Oyó**: Thus began the series of systematic invasions of Yorubaland by Dahomey. Motivated by considerations of state security and by the insatiable demand for slaves for export, for labour for both cash crop and subsistence agri› culture for the state and for the purpose of human sacrifice at the wellknown annual customs, the invasion affected not only the Yoruba west of the Ogun river. Equally affected were the Aja and Manhi communities and states east of the Werne river, including Porto Novo. 25 While the invasion of the Mahi immediately north of Agbome and of Porto Novo in the south-east was carried out in the 1820s, in the 1830s the concentration was on such Egbado towns as Ijanna and Refurefu, which were razed to the ground in 1831 and 1836 respectively. Ijanna, as noted above, was the residence of the Oyo imperial agent and the main centre for collecting and forwarding tributes from the Egbado and neighbouring area. In the 1840s and again in the 1880s, Okeodan and Sabe were ravaged. Also in the latter decade, the kingdom of Ketu, which began to be harassed in the late 1870s, was finally destroyed in 1886, four years after Imeko, the one other major town within the kingdom, had been burnt down.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Traditional African religion in the pre-colonial period**: Traditional African religion was, and still is, inextricably bound up with African culture. It was a pervasive force, and as Emmanuel Obiechina aptly puts it: There is hardly any important area of human experience which is not linked to the supernatural and the people's sense of religion and religious piety ... these ... are part and parcel of the ideological structure of traditional society, and so essential to a proper interpreta› tion of experience in the traditional social context. 1
This pervasiveness of religion through the total way of life of African peoples gave traditional religion a remarkable wholeness within the context of the culture out of which it originated.
It was based on a particular world view, which included not only the people's view of the supernatural but also their understanding of the nature of the universe, the nature of human beings and their place in the world, and the nature of God, who was known by various local names. Essentially a spirit, God had no images or physical representations and was acknowledged as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. Power, justice, beneficence and eternity were attributed to Him, and as the Source of all Power, God had power over life and death. He rewarded men but also punished them when they went wrong and was in many ways likened to the Overlord of Society and was the Final Authority in all matters. On the whole, God was unlike human beings and was completely above His creation, but at the same time, He was involved in the affairs of men, sustaining creation and upholding the moral order. Human beings depended upon Him as a Power superior to them. God was therefore transcendent as well as immanent.
There was a hierarchy of spirits. Below God were the ancestral spirits, which were always treated with reverence and with awe, and then there were also the deities or gods who were believed to have the power of rewarding human beings or punishing them with misfortune, disease or even death. The divinities had their cults, priests and shrines and there were some among them which were associated with various features of the environment: but these palpable objects were the abodes of the gods and not the gods themselves.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Traditional African religion in the pre-colonial period**: In addition to these supernatural entities, there were other spirits or mystical powers which were recognized and reckoned with for their ability to aid or harm human beings. Included in these were agents of witchcraft, magic and sorcery. Finally, there were charms, amulets and talismans which were used for protective as well as offensive purposes.
The general conception of man was that he was a compound of immaterial and material substance. The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities. Human society was an unbroken family made up of the dead, the living and the yet unborn.
With regard to man's relation to society, being human meant belonging to a community and that involved participating in the beliefs, ceremonies, rituals and festivals ofthat community$^{2}$ and membership of the community was emphasized more than a member's individuality. For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife. An individual did not stay in one stage of existence for ever; he necessarily moved on to the next, and in order to make the transition smooth, special rites were performed to ensure that no breaks occurred, and movement and regeneration continued perpetually. 3
African traditional religion was not only pervasive, it also bound men to the unseen powers and helped them to form correct relations with the non-human powers; it also bound men to their fellow human beings.
Religion acted as the cement which held societies together, providing them with support and stability. Furthermore, traditional religion helped men to understand and control events, to relieve doubt, anxiety and guilt.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.
Nevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast.
* **The role of religious ideas**: Meanwhile historians have been re-examining the role of religious ideas in the resistances. What they have found bears little resemblance either to the 'fanatical witch-doctors' of colonial reports, or to 'the magic of despair'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that 'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for "primary resistances" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. 'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the 'high priestess' was dismissed and executed. 'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west. Some› times it happened because of the influence of Christian ideas - and Hendrik Wittboi drew upon Protestant Christianity for his doctrine of sovereignty, while an African independent Christian prophet was active among the Nama at the time of their rising against the Germans. Very often it happened in the context of African religion.
* **Society and power in Central Africa (c. 1800-80)**: In addition to these material factors, however, there existed ritual aspects of power, represented by insignia and charms against enemies both within and without. How did the exercise of ritual and mystical power develop at a time of rapid reversals in the military and economic fortunes of these societies? Until historians have turned their attention to this question, our understanding of the history of the region must remain incomplete and confined within terms of reference that fail to reflect the deep aspirations of the ancient societies of Central Africa.
* **Change and continuity**: Nor is the 'traditional-modern' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku'ranic and Western schools.
Thus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant 'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of "civilization" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as 'enthusiastically and successfully' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting 'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives'$^{3}$ available to them.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > Summary**: In addition, the captives which these kingdoms needed as a form of currency with which to buy rare goods and the instruments of war were being carried off at a rate which was becoming less and less compatible with the survival of the societies concerned, especially when they were seized from peoples already subject to tribute, since that depleted the reserves of the dominant powers. Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.
In these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism. However, the Islamic successor states were themselves ephemeral, for they were victims of the same objective conditions that had already doomed the autonomous development of the African states.
* **Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux**: The political organization of Liptako represented an attempt to maintain a balance between the clans, and this was reflected in its very structures. Power was transmitted through patrilineal descent from Saidu, the father of that Brahima who had led the djihäd. However, the Ferrobe eventually decided or agreed that their antagonists, the Torodbe, should constitute the electoral college that designated the amir. The college investigated each candidate's personal qualities, such as justice and piety, as well as the services he had rendered, the extent of his matrimonial alliances, and the like, and finally gave a decision. By means of this participation, the Torodbe, even though they were debarred from wielding power themselves, were placed in a position where they could in a sense decide among the Ferrobe claimants, and this served to integrate them into the system. 43 Once the new amir had been tentatively selected, he was subjected to an interview and asked trick questions. Then animals were sacrificed to the genii and to a sacred snake. A new traditional drum was made, to be included among the symbols of power granted by the Sokoto council. 44 The new amir's head was swathed in a turban by one of the Torodbe in the presence of the chief imam and the kadi, and facing the standard he swore to respect the customs and principles of Islam and to maintain the welfare of his people. This was a ritual of political and religious renewal of cosmic dimensions, designed to appease supernatural forces of all descriptions. The religious authorities were appointed by the kadi of Dori and were invested with judicial power as courts of appeal. In addition, there was a network of village imams, headed by the chief imam of Dori.
* ****: A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination. What was true in 1976 can be seen as having been even more commonplace in that more dramatic period of external domina› tion in Africa, when an entire people, its social organizations, and its economic and artistic patterns became subjugated to strategies for maximum exploitation by outside interests. The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word. The Arabic dimension was unique in its own right, an ambivalent face of expansionism which none the less left strong cultural impressions on the landscape. Yet the reality that we extract from that period is the resilience and even increased vitality of the forms and values of the authentic cultures of the peoples.
* **The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14 > The Ogowe basin and surrounding regions 23**: However, despite the deep inroads made by Western influences, the indigenous societies were able to retain their identity. For it must be pointed out that, towards the end of the nineteenth century, vast regions were still all but unaffected by these alien influences. Even where, as on the coast, such influences were already very powerful, they ran up against various forms ofdiehard opposition from the local cultures. Thus the largescale effort to evangelize the local populations had to contend with such widespread indigenous cults as Bwiti, Bieri and Ombwiri, and social customs such as polygamy.
* ****: The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions. It was also a cultural imposition and it used culture to buttress the political, economic and social superstructure which colonial› ism represented. It is the religious aspect of this cultural imposition of colonialism and the African response to it that this chapter deals with.
* **African traditional religion and colonial rule**: Africans used their religion as a weapon to resist colonial rule and its threat to their values, and often relied on magic and the intervention of their ancestors and gods in their fight against colonial oppression. In the first two decades of this century, the Igbo warriors of south-eastern Nigeria resorted to such means to defend themselves from alien invaders. The Esza people of Abakaliki Division, the Uzuakoli and the Aro may be cited as examples.$^{6}$ Some cults were clearly a focus for resistance to colonial rule, such as the Mwari in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), or secret associations like the Poro in Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa. War-charm movements also occurred in Madagascar and the Congo basin. In East Africa, especially Kenya, African prophets arose to provide spiritual reinvigoration$^{7}$ to resist colonialism, such as occurred in the Machakos District among the people of Kilungu in the early months of 1922 (see Chapter 26). One of the best-known movements which used both religion and magic to resist colonial rule and oppression was the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa during the first decade of the twen› tieth century.$^{8}$ (See Fig. 7.1.) Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities. Besides, the movement provided the seed for African nationalism which was later to germinate and blossom into the struggle for independ› ence and its final achievement in the 1960s.
* **The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean**: A feature of this syncretism was observance of Catholic feast days and saints' days, together with recourse to the orixas and to voodoo. Thus, the feast days of the gods coincided with the dates of the Catholic saints' days. Bastide asserts that syncretism is no more than a white mask for Negro gods. The values of the two religions interpenetrate in varying degrees. In Brazil, for instance, a series of Catholic sacraments, such as baptism, are repeated not only for ritualistic purposes but also to give the individual additional strength. This acculturation of values of European origin marks even the forms closest to the African sources, such as candomblØ, macumba and other cults, some of which are close to, or even characterized by, magic. In the case oimacumba, attention should be drawn to the presence of Amerindian values, the acculturation here being of a threefold variety.
Examples of syncretism involving Amerindian culture can be seen in the West Indies, particularly in Honduras, where a mestizo people has emerged as the result of interbreeding between Amerindian women and Africans referred to as black Caribs.$^{73}$ These Africans were the descendants of the Igbo and Efik and, subsequently, of the Fante, Asante, Fon and Congo.
The 'African societies' gradually turned into 'black societies', varying in the strength of their connection with Africa and in their integration in society as a whole, in the sense of gaining full citizenship.
From the social standpoint, integration in society as a whole was keyed to the following variables: the type of society of the white colonizer; the form of land exploration; the religion of the colonizer - Protestant or Catholic; the percentage of Amerindians in the population and the degree of integration in the economic process imposed by the regime of the colonizer, either during the colonial period proper or following the attain› ment of independence by the Americas.
* **Religious change**: In this region the nineteenth century was a period of rapid advance for Islam in the north and centre, while Christianity was reintroduced in the south. More than ever these two religions were associated with the prestige of education, in the form of the ability to write, and with a much wider world than the one bounded by local horizons.
In the northern part of the region the wide influence of the djihâds led by eminent men ('Uthmän Dan Fodio of Sokoto, Seku Ahmadu of Massina and al-Hadjdj 'Umar Tal) produced powerful and lasting effects, as, for example, the djihad and the emirate of Liptako.
Even the Bambara and Mossi kingdoms were carried along in the wake of this uprush of Islamic proselytizing activity, or at any rate influenced by it. The Bambara and the Mossi have usually been termed 'ramparts against the expansion of Islam', but if this clichØ was ever true, it certainly was not so in the nineteenth century, when Islam was a powerful force not only at the top of the social order in these kingdoms, but in every part of society. We need look no further than the kingdom of Segu under Monzón Jara early in the century; here, the ruler's mother, Makoro, made use of the services of marabouts from Segu Sikoro and Tegu to bring about a reconciliation between the king and his brother Nyanakoro Da. Monzón Jara's successor asked a learned marabout who was a friend of his for a talisman that would bring him victory. Torokoro Mari (1854-6) turned over one of his sons to al-Hadjdj 'Umar and asked the latter to bring him up; to be sure, this induced the monarch's warriors to abandon their allegiance and drown him, explaining to his successor, 'We killed your brother because he wanted to compel us to become Muslims, and because he was squandering the state's resources by showering gifts on marabouts'. 65 In the Mossi kingdoms, the only Muslims up to that point had been the YarsØ, but early in the nineteenth century the Mogho-Naaba openly embraced the Islamic faith and in their turn these established nuclei of missionary activity.
* **African traditional religion and colonial rule**: Another cult similar to Majï Majï was the Nyabingi cult, which also covered a wide area and cut across ethnic and regional boundaries and was found in Ruanda (now Rwanda), north-western Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and Uganda. Like the followers of Majï Majï its adherents believed that the power of its medicines could neutralize the effect of European bullets, as well as believing in possession by the spirits of legendary ancestors. It began during the late nineteenth century and gathered momentum until it finally broke out in 1928 in revolt against European occupation in the Kigezi region of Uganda. (See Fig. 7.1.) As E. Hopkins put it, 'the movement succeeded in immobilizing the admini› strative efforts of three colonial powers for nearly two decades until its final suppression in 1928'.$^{9}$ The Germans, and the Belgians who took over Ruanda from them after the First World War, failed to suppress it, and even after the suppression of the 1928 uprising, the cult lingered on until it was finally suppressed in 1934.
Other cults gathered force against the European pressure by reviving aspects of traditional religion and combining them with ideas borrowed from Christianity. Such, for example, was the Mumbo cult which was used by the Gusii people, near Lake Victoria in Kenya, as the buttress of their revolt against British colonialism which began in 1900.$^{10}$ (See Fig. 7.1.)
In the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the British colonial, administration adopted a hostile attitude towards certain religious practices, abolished some and endeavoured to suppress certain deities and cults. Thus the cult of Katawere, the tutelary deity of Akim Kotoku, was prohibited by the government in 1907. ' ' Prior to this the German government had destroyed the shrines of the cult of Denteh of Kete-Krachi in the 1880s and the priest of Denteh had been imprisoned and executed by the government. The Krobo people were forced to abandon their settlements on the Krobo mountain by the British colonial administration which destroyed their settlements and suppressed the cult of their tutelary shrines of Kotoklo and Nadu.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: In the west, the predominantly Catholic and lusophone Brazilian Africans initially found a more congenial cultural environment in Porto Novo and Whydah, where they had been preceded by an older 'Brazilian' community founded by Brazilian Portuguese slavers who had to withdraw entirely to the Aja coast in consequence of the British anti-slave trade naval action further east. The eventual substitution of French for Portuguese control of the area of the Gulf of Benin west of the Werne still left a residue of Latin culture sufficient to make Brazilians prefer this to the eastern coast, where Latin cultural influence was destined for eventual extinction. Consequently, it was in the area that eventually became French Dahomey that is the western parts of the region under discussion - that Brazilian Africans made their greatest impact. Not only did they co-operate with the French in the latter's successful bid to conquer Dahomey and create their new colony: Brazilians also ranked first and foremost in the colony in taking full advantage of French colonial education, thus making them a crucial factor in the growth of Dahomey as the 'Quartier Latin of French West Africa'. 45 However, this dichotomy in the locational focus of the impact of Saros and Brazilians must not be interpreted as contradictory to the overall development of the Mono-Niger region as an integral whole. Strong feelings of community based on specific kinship ties and general historical and cultural affinities among descendants of the da Silvas, the d'Almeidas, the Dos Regos, the de Souzas, the Pedros, the Martins, the Pereiras and so on, whether in Lagos, Whydah, Agwe or Porto Novo, warn against such interpretations. Indeed, the continuous recognition to this day of the relationship between West African Brazilian families and their original Brazilian bases, particularly those in the state of Bahia, makes the Brazilian connection an illustrious example of the essential unity not only of the history of Africa but also of the vital communication between the continent and the black diaspora.
* **Religious protest movements**: One of the weapons that East Africans used from early on in their struggle against colonialism was religion. Resistance called for mobilization, and in many regions religious leadership arose to fulfil this role. The era of primary resistance was also the era of the prophets. While the Africans lost the actual wars in the battlefield, the mood of resistance remained entrenched in the hearts of the many. The followers of the Orkoiyot in Nandi remained active and watchful and the Nandi were repeatedly mobilized by this prophetic leadership to resist the abuses of colonialism over the years.$^{4}$ Similarly colonial archives from Kenya are full of references to witch doctors and laibons creating trouble in Marakwet, Kericho and Samburu. In western Uganda the followers of the Nyabingi cult in Kigezi were being watched all through these years. Thus these traditional religious resistance movements provided an element of continuity with the former era. But as the first decade wore on into the second, colonialism appeared to be gaining in strength; to many, indeed, it appeared as if the worst of the evils had come to earth. The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5
Although not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric. These religious innovations were protest movements. Starting from the second decade, these activities were to continue through› out the 1920s and 1930s, and were to be joined by many more after the Second World War. What they stood for can be seen by two studies from the Kamba and the Abagusii of Kenya.
* **Islam and colonial rule**: try to cope with Islam and established institutes to study and document Muslim life, beliefs, practices and institutions. 22 Colonial powers were determined to break up large Muslim states and religious organizations and to foster rivalry and competition among them. Thus the British abolished the Sokoto caliphate in Northern Nigeria while the French openly encouraged the ethnic and dynastic rivalries which led to the disintegration of the Tukulor empire (see Fig. 6.2) and the proliferation of Sufi orders, and refused to recognize one Khalifa for all Muslim members of the Tijaniyya order in West Africa.
* **Literary culture in the Western Sudan**: We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance. In some cases, the Dyula community became thoroughly assimilated into the local community. Such instances of total assimilation were rare, but I. Wilks, in his informative study,$^{36}$ points to one example - the Tagara of Jirapa in north-western Ghana. The process was insidious enough. As already discussed in the case of the funeral rites of the Koumina canton, the Africans retained their custodianship of land, both physically and ritualistically, so that while, in the towns, contacts with the French and Islamic 'civilizing' missions, demonstrated undeniable advantage for the converts, the seasonal 'commuting' between land and city itself displaced 'unsecured' groups and individuals. Such was the fate of the Dyula.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In this custom he has to pass the furniture round the market, just the same as the other, and before doing the night previous must be evil night. The evil night carried away thirty-two. Two small trees were transplanted to the palace gate that night, and on each of these trees hung eight heads of the men killed in the night, as the fruits of the trees. Although this custom has nothing to do with a platform, he erected one; and on this he formed some stick-work, and laid a man on them, well fastened, and covered him with white baft, and saddled him; which was to imply that his late father rode on so high a white horse, that he saw everything in the world; that there was nothing hid from him. He also bound two men close to the poor fellow as his ostlers. All were left there until they were dead! He had three more evil nights, and on each occasion he had forty men killed. These poor fellows all fell victims under the Dahoman cutlass in the month of October. And does not the blood of these poor fellows cry to the Christian English to hasten themselves for the rescue of the weak and innocent from the mighty? As soon as the custom is entirely finished, the lion of the Bights will be up to seek more poor fellows for his cutlass, or for the slavers, to obtain money. I believe Christian England will embrace all chance to make an end of the slave-trade. The King of Dahomey throws all the fault upon those who bring vessels to purchase slaves in his country; he would sell none if no vessel came to purchase. What will Christian England do to stop this trade? Just about a month ago an American schooner left Whydah with upwards of 200 slaves, although the ships of war have been watching the schooner as closely as they possibly could.

* **The Adventures of S. Tubman, a Liberian, who has Escaped from Slavery in Dahomey**: 

At Abeokuta, on Sunday, the 11th April, 1875, during Divine service, at 10.30 a.m., several of us went out of the Church to meet the Dahomians, having heard of their approaching to the outside wall. As we went out we saw the Dahomians coming towards us, and went to meet them, not knowing that some Dahomians had already placed themselves in ambush. We halted, fired, and then wheeled round, and ran to save our lives. Those in ambush in our rear now came out and fired at us. Some had guns and others matchets and club sticks. I got to within about twenty yards of the gate when one of the Dahomians struck me violently on the back with his club and I fell down on my face to the ground. I was taken up, tied with rope, and taken to the camp; was in the Dahomian camp for about five days, and then sent under Dahomian escort, with about 800 egbas (men and women), that were caught and taken captives about the farms to Abomey; two old soldiers (pensioners) were amongst the lot. We were eleven days on the way from Abeokuta to Abomey, the capital of Dahomey. Several captives who were wounded, including one of the old soldiers, died on the way, and were thrown into the bush like beasts. We were fed with either roast corn or casada, taken from the farms by the Dahomians. We were all tied severally with ropes: at times we ate food once a day, at other times twice. On arrival at Abomey we were all put in chains—by the neck—remained in sitting posture; fed with either agidi, casida, or farina, with ground pepper and salt. We were locked up in a large compound. About fifteen days after our reaching Abomey, the king arrived with his army and some more captives. We were all taken out and brought before responsible chiefs. A fetish priest brought some fetish water in a pot mixed with some ingredient, and gave us each to drink. Those who leant back after drinking one or two glasses of this mixture are put by to be killed; those who sit upright are saved, and destined to be sold into slavery. About 300 leant back and were killed by the king's executioner, at the rate of fifty per day. I saw it all; I was among the saved ones. About a month afterwards I was sold with others to a chief called Wenu, of Arada, a village of about half an hour's journey from Abomey; he bought me for forty bags of cornes, 25f. Although I was born in Liberia and speak and write English, I was very careful not to let them know it, otherwise the king would not have sold me, nor would I afterwards be able to run away. My new master placed me to work in the farm planting yams, corn, casada, etc., and at times sent me in company of other slaves to Whydah to fetch rolls, tobacco, goods, cowries, and rum. When the English Commodore's ship came to Whydah, in February last, to see about some matters, was sent to fetch goods, and I saw some of the officers on shore. I managed to speak to one of the naval officers, recounting my trouble, and he said if I could manage to get on board one of the men-of-war ships, all right; but it was difficult, as the Dahomian authorities at Whydah are very particular with slaves. On the 15th May I was sent again to Whydah, in company of sixty slaves, to fetch goods. We reached Whydah on Wednesday, about 7 o'clock p.m. I told the chief I was going to the yard, where we lodge for the night, and I took occasion to go down the beach unperceived by any one; and by the sea shore I passed all the Custom offices in the different stations; the officials were all asleep. I travelled all night and reached Godomey at 4 o'clock a.m. I went and hid myself in the bush, as it was unsafe for a runaway slave to travel by day. On Thursday evening, at about 7 o'clock, I came out of the bush, and proceeded on my way to Kotonu. I arrived there at midnight. I went in to some of the Cape Palmas Kis-boys, in the employ of Regis Aine's house, and as I could talk the Kiss language, they took me in and hid me in their room. In the afternoon of Friday some canoes arrived from Porto Novo with produce. On returning I succeeded, through the Kissboyso in making arrangement with the Causenien, and I came away with them on Saturday night, and arrived in Porto Novo about 4 o'clock on Sunday morning. I lodged at the house of Senor Bambera. On Monday, the 22nd instant, I saw the steamer Renner in the river, and I went off to the owner on board and told him my trouble. He kindly gave me a free passage to Lagos. We left Porto Novo on Wednesday night, and reached Lagos on Thursday, the 25th instant. Seeing Lagos once more, I thank God for His mercies and safe deliverance. Whilst at Arada the king, who left home with his army in January last, on their usual expedition to Abeokuta and other places, sent home some slaves that he had recently captured from a village. Elated with this he went to Meks; he drove the people into the town; but, mustering efforts, the Meks people drove him out with great loss. About the fines imposed by the Commodore, the king sent to tell the chiefs at home that he will not pay; that he bought nothing from the English Government; but, as for his debt he owed some of the merchants he will pay them; that if the English wanted to fight him, the Commodore must send him notice beforehand, and not take him by surprise. On that account he sent orders and many fetish were made and sacrifices offered to them. A small wooden vessel was made to represent an English ship of war; they bore it fore and aft and, passing chains through it, suspended it, and decorated it with flags, blue, while, and red, put small anchor to it, as well as fetish—the vessel rested on a platform built of mud;—this implied that if the English men-of-war came to fight them the ships would be unable to move, and the Dahomian army will easily get them on the beach, and haul them up on shore. I saw human sacrifices offered to three idols or gods: one is in a house built with human blood and mud, and decorated with the skulls; another built with human blood, mud, and different kinds of beads; and the third built of different pattern of cloth in wooden frame. Before the king left home in January last on his expedition, several hundreds of the captives were killed and offered as sacrifices, several sent to be sold to the westward countries. I saw several slaves for mere trifling things done were tied up and flogged severely, till blood flowed from the body; others are beaten with club-sticks. I was flogged twice, and the marks on my person are evidence. I was nearly dead, and I resolved to escape by the first opportunity. I hope the day will soon come when Dahomey will be taken by England, or at least be made to feel its power.
* **West Coast News**: By the Volta we learn from Whydah that the Chaca, or governor of the place, had died a few weeks before the Volta called there, and that, owing to orders from the King of Dahomey, great excitement prevailed, and trade was almost stopped. The funeral of the Chaca was to be celebrated by a “custom,” or massacre of natives. This was to take place in Abomey, and was to be followed by another given at Whydah by the new Chaca in honour of his predecessor. After this was over, the King had announced his intention of holding his annual custom in memory of his deceased father. This celebration lasts four months, during which time about 200 captured prisoners will probably be beheaded. All the chiefs and the European merchants were summoned to Abomey to witness the “custom,” but the English subjects refused positively to go.

At Cape Coast Castle an assize had been held at which a man convicted of slave-dealing was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment. Two solicitors were suspended from practice in consequence of alleged irregularities with their clients.
* **Serious Troubles at Porto Novo**: Recent news from Lagos, *via* Paris, reports that Porto Novo, which is under French protection, is in a state of consternation, and the European traders are clamouring to be protected. That region has been suddenly invaded and harried by the King of Dahomey. The invading army is reported as numbering about ten thousand men, including the Amazon corps, which led the attacks. They fired ten important villages and some trading stations, killing all the elderly people, and carrying away all the able-bodied and children. This incursion is ascribed to a religious motive. The Amazons have depopulated the districts bordering on that of Porto Novo to appease the hunger of the evil spirits, who, the priests teach them, feed in some mysterious manner on those sacrificed to them. They have therefore, in their dread of their maleficent divinities, been emboldened to invade a territory which, being under French protection and enjoying an immunity from the sacrificial tax, is thickly populated. Sometimes as many as eight hundred human beings are offered up at Dahomey as a hecatomb. The most robust female children taken prisoners of war are reserved for the Amazonian corps, which now amounts to 4,000. They are entirely consecrated to martial purposes, and obliged under capital penalty to remain vestals. A gallant who causes an Amazon to forget her duties is smeared with honey and tied to a tree to be devoured by insects. These female warriors are more ferocious than their military brethren. They often sacrifice to Bacchus. Their King is nearly always drunk.

## The Kingdom of Dahomey played a pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade, with its economy and the authority of its rulers heavily reliant on the trade, while the King justified its continuation by blaming foreign demand, suggesting that its abolition required addressing this demand and exploring alternative commerce, despite the significant economic and historical impact on the region.

The Kingdom of Dahomey played a pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade, with both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles providing insights that support this claim. The textbook highlights Dahomey's heavy economic reliance on the slave trade, noting that King Gezo continued to supply slaves to Portuguese dealers despite European abolitionist pressures. It describes Dahomey as a persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state, with its rulers' authority tied to the trade, and mentions a transition to palm oil trade as an alternative commerce. Although the textbook does not explicitly state that King Gezo justified the trade by blaming foreign demand, it implies awareness of demand from Brazil-based Portuguese dealers. The African Times articles further support the claim by emphasizing Dahomey's economic and political dependence on the slave trade, with Whydah as a principal port for slave exportation. They note that the King justified the trade's continuation by blaming foreign demand, particularly from Cuba, and suggested that abolition required addressing this demand. The articles also highlight the King's interest in alternative commerce, such as palm oil, while acknowledging the ongoing significance of the slave trade. Additionally, they discuss British efforts to suppress the trade and the diplomatic challenges involved. While the articles do not explicitly address the historical impact on the region, both sources collectively underscore Dahomey's crucial role in the slave trade and the complexities surrounding its abolition.

* **The collapse of Old Oyó**: Although independence from Oyo had been the policy of all Dahomey monarchs, beginning with Kpengla (1774-89), it was not until the opening years of the reign of Gezo (1818-58) that the Oyo imperial yoke was repudiated. In spite of occasional disruptions and violence in the Agbome court, as can be illustrated by the regicide of Agonglo (Kpengla's son and successor) in 1797 and the deposition of Adandozan (1797-1818) in favour of Gezo (his junior brother), Dahomey in contrast to Old Oyo in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was remarkable for the appreciably long reigns of its kings.
Political stability was further guaranteed by the successful operation of the highly centralized administration for which the kingdom is well known. The European anti-slave trade movement hit the state's economy, based as it was almost solely on the slave trade. However, Gezo's economic policy was to continue to respond to the demand for slaves from Portuguese dealers while at the same time responding to the stimulus of the export trade in palm oil as the ultimate substitute for slave exports.$^{22}$ These signs of the relative political and economic strength of Dahomey were becoming visible at the same time as symptoms of advanced decline were becoming increasingly apparent in Old Qyo. It was the combination of these factors that ostensibly encouraged Gezo to stage a unilateral declaration of inde› pendence in the early 1820s.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.
Nevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast.
* **Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation**: The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.
In all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.
In this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier. Dahomey continued with the slave trade for as long as there were customers.
* **African reactions**: On the borders of Sierra Leone the configuration was an advantage to busy English, Spanish and mulatto-owned slave factories at Rio Nunez and Rio Pongos in the north-west and on the Gallinas river in the south› east. The production areas, though sometimes 400-500 km distant, were mostly near the coast. Transactions were personal between local chiefs, caravaneers, brokers and agents. In Dahomey, on the other hand, the slave trade was one of the mainstays of the ruling house, which delegated the running of it to its chief vassals. In 1818 King Gezo, who was in debt to the Brazilian mulatto Francisco Felix Da Souza, appointed Da Souza as chacha, a 'white-man's chief who acted as an economic adviser and administrator of the Whydah trade. This office survived the death of the first chacha in 1849 and was inherited by Da Souza's son. It was management on a grand scale: the chachas kept a stock of Western goods, offset bookkeeping debits and credits, prepared cargoes in advance to facilitate speedy loading, collected taxes, checked the movements of white foreigners, and provided entertainment for their customers. This economic apparatus was capable of being adapted to other types of produce. Produce for the slave trade, which was in the hands of the chiefs, was secured by annual military expeditions, not always victorious, against the neighbouring countries, principally the Yoruba. It also came from the Central Sudan - whence captives were distributed, moreover, to the north and to Egypt - by caravans, which split up their loads at the border: the blacks earmarked for export, who were strong, were kept aside and incorporated in the ordinary porterage teams.$^{25}$ Further east, from Badagry to the borders of the kingdom of Benin, prolonged strife among the Yoruba people glutted the Whydah market. Local rulers and the black and white slave-traders of the lagoons supplied the heavy demand from the Portuguese and Brazilians, who made the best part of their fortune out of it before turning their hands to other kinds of trade. 26 East of Cape Formosa, among the rivers of the Niger delta from the Nun to Old Calabar, the slave trade was still run by the remarkable machinery that came into play in the last third of the eighteenth century, though this was already being applied to other types of trade that were carried on simultaneously. Local
* **The West African pattern**: Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded. In particular it seems that direct European involvement was counterproductive, as in the failed efforts at agricultural colonization in Waalo between 1819 and 1831,$^{21}$ and in the various efforts in Senegal, the southern Gold Coast, and Nigeria later on.$^{22}$ It was not that European personnel began to loom larger on the African scene; rather, the important change was that Europeans were largely displacing African merchants from The shift from the slave trade to palm oil strengthened the hand of private as against royal merchants (R. Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena. 'The bulking up, transporting and storage of commodities like palm oil and groundnuts, and the breaking down of imported goods into the quantities needed for many small producers, required more manpower than the trade in slaves'. See J. F. Munro, 1976, 47. the role of those in the port areas who purchased bulk items from traders who went into the interior and shipped them overseas, and vice-versa. 23 New export-oriented production necessarily implied new imports. The import of various European manufactures, particularly from Great Britain, multiplied throughout the nineteenth century. For example, cotton-goods
* **Protecting new trade**: The coast had always exported palm oil, but in minute quantities. Imports into Britain rose from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21 000 tonnes in 1844, levelled off for ten years or so, and then doubled by 1870. France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade.
* **Implications of incorporation**: There is no need to exaggerate the role of external forces in African statebuilding. The internal forces were the primary mechanism of political evolution and the existing logics of development account for most of the particular details. Furthermore states were constructed in this same era which were quite remote from the world-economy as, for example, the Rozvi.$^{35}$ Also it is quite obvious, by looking at the West African states, that there is an imperfect connection between participation in the slave-trade and state-formation. If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.
The outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process. But the fact that such a pressure group existed and played a role in the process is not an explanation of the process but one of the aspects of it that needs to be explained.
* **African reactions**: Cliometricians, sociologists and historians agree that the slave trade was a complete catastrophe for Africa. Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered. Certain individuals with strong personalities were able to consolidate their power, men like Tippu Tip, for instance, or Rabeh. But any benefits that may have been conferred on the regions under their control still have to be identified by specialists.
* **The growth of European interest**: Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.
This flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.
It was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.
All these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.
* **Protecting new trade**: The naval squadrons were less concerned about suppression than about their task of protecting the 'legitimate' trade of their own nationals. From the first decades of the nineteenth century the coast met American, British and French demand for African natural products, and these purchases increased. In 1838, Bouºt-Willaumez, later Governor of Senegal and the forerunner of colonization, ordered a systematic survey to be carried out of the possibilities for trade between Senegal and Gabon. Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave. Change was in the air. The industrial and technological revolutions in Britain and France were ush› ering in the modern age, and it was also on the way in other countries. It created new needs, the most important of which, from the coast's point of view, was for oils, as lubricants for machinery and the raw material of soap and lamp fuel. The products of African oil-bearing plants thus established themselves in Western markets.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Production and trade**: The abolition of the slave trade by Britain in 1807 introduced an element of structural imbalance into this situation, especially in the south, where surveillance was instituted earliest and maintained most strictly, although domestic slavery was tolerated.$^{48}$ During the second half of the nineteenth century slavery expanded very substantially, especially in the Niger bend. This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange. It is not surprising, then, to find entire groups, such as the Zamberma, spe› cializing in the extraction of this 'black ore'. The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances. When indigenous peoples took action to organize their own defence, they were frequently used as mercenaries in wars elsewhere, as in the case of some of the Gurunsi who fought in the ranks of the Zamberma, and the Samo (Sanan) who took part in the dynastic wars of Yatenga.
* **From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns**: It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift. The Angolan coast was involved in a major way as of the sixteenth century, the Bight of Benin only as off. 1650, the Gold Coast as of c. 1700, the Bight of Biafra as off. 1740. The Sierra Leone coast, involved early, was a significant exporter only as of the middle of the eighteenth century. South-east Africa became a major source only in the nineteenth century. procedures for obtaining their quarry. At some point, therefore, production and political systems in West and Central Africa began to be adjusted as a function of these now continuing economic ties. When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'.
* **Increased European interest**: The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.
A third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.
* **The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy**: the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction. More commonly, the competition for captive labour generated intense hostility among and within trading factions. There are numerous examples of wars among the Chikunda bands, Yao chiefs and Swahili trading groups.$^{61}$ The dependence on European arms and alien intermediaries often left the indigenous trading communities quite vulnerable. The Portuguese, for example, exploited their role as suppliers of weapons to pressure the Chikunda bands to recognize Lisbon's limited authority over their territory.$^{62}$ Similarly, the Sena began to rely so heavily on their Arab allies that they jeopardized their sovereign status. 63 Even the powerful Bemba were not totally immune to pressures from Arab and Swahili traders. 64 Moreover, with the abolition of the slave trade, those classes or strata within them who profited from the trade - the aristocracy, merchants, warlords and landlords - searched desperately for new commodities such as wax, coffee, groundnuts, and vegetable oils which they could extract from their subordinates or acquire through commerce in order to ensure a constant supply of European consumer goods and weapons necessary to maintain their privileged position. In some regions this legitimate com› merce offered new opportunities for aspiring itinerant traders to accumulate capital and for the growth of peasant agriculture. To the extent that particular classes or strata successfully made this transition, they merely perpetuated or extended their dependent position in a world economy over which they had no control.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels**: The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.
While Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend. Silks and carpets from Turkey and Tripoli, natron from Borno, and Hausa textiles, were exchanged for kola nuts, gold, cotton materials from Dagomba, Mossi and Mande, shea butter and livestock from the Sudanese Sahel.
* **The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy**: The impact ofthe slave-traders on the political fortunes ofthe indigenous aristocracy was not uniform. In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent
* **The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy**: Ironically, those rulers and merchants engaged in the quest for additional captives occasionally became victims of the political and social upheavals generated by the slave trade. In several instances, they overstepped their authority and enslaved their own subjects or neighbours in order to main› tain the flow of wealth and weapons upon which their power rested. The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades. Fifty years later the Gwemba, Nsenga and Tawara rose up against their mestizo (Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Asian) and Chikunda overlords who had been enslaving them and exporting them to the coast.$^{48}$ } '' The Shona-dominated region, stretching from the southern margins of the Zambezi to the Inhambane hinterland, becariie a secondary source of slaves, as did the Delagoa Bay area to the south. Within this broad zone there were only small pockets of alien commercial penetration, most notably Chikunda conquests along the southern margins of the Zambezi river, and occasional forays by Portuguese and African traders linked to commercial interests at the ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques (present-day Maputo). These
* **The West African pattern**: One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life. Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.
The rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area. This production at first co-existed with the slave trade,$^{14}$ and later flourished on its own, until the boom came to an end in 1861, and finally declined at the end of the century.$^{15}$ The palm-oil trade similarly expanded in the Gold He finds the relevant consideration to be Europe's need of raw materials and points out the 'extraordinary demands on production' involved in the new amounts of palm oil, timber, and rubber exported. 'Many producers became involved in the harvest of the new commodities over wide areas.'
* **The Niger delta > The Igbo hinterland**: The predominantly disruptive character of the slave trade may be shown in different ways. First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.
In the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments. But these supplies replaced local industries, and the Awka smiths turned their backs on local sources of metal. Import› ation of salt and cloth also undermined local industries.
* **Resistance to the imperial drive in the South, 1821-80**: Futhermore, there were the European merchants who were demanding from the Turkish government that the Sudanese ivory markets be thrown open to free trade. When later the European traders were faced with lower profit margins, they decided to pay their Arab retainers in slaves rather than in cash, and this intensified the slave trade. Kaka in northern Shillukland soon emerged as a major slave market, especially for slaves coming from the southern zeribas. The boom at Kaka was partly connected with the abolition of the slave trade in the Turkish-controlled Sudan in 1854. It became the main slave market of the White Nile, and its immigrant population swelled rapidly. The activities of the freebooter, Muhammad al-Khäyr, a Dongalawi by birth, who moved to Kaka from Taqali in 1854, may also have facilitated the transformation of Kaka into a slave market. 25 It is estimated that by i860, an average of 2000 slaves were being sold annually at Kaka and, to acquire this number, Khâyr and his slave gangs were terrorizing the whole Shilluk countryside.$^{2}$^ The southerners refused to co-operate with the traders and actively resisted their presence in their land. The wars that were waged against the intruders are too many and too diversified to be enumerated here. Only a few need be mentioned as illustration.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In this custom he has to pass the furniture round the market, just the same as the other, and before doing the night previous must be evil night. The evil night carried away thirty-two. Two small trees were transplanted to the palace gate that night, and on each of these trees hung eight heads of the men killed in the night, as the fruits of the trees. Although this custom has nothing to do with a platform, he erected one; and on this he formed some stick-work, and laid a man on them, well fastened, and covered him with white baft, and saddled him; which was to imply that his late father rode on so high a white horse, that he saw everything in the world; that there was nothing hid from him. He also bound two men close to the poor fellow as his ostlers. All were left there until they were dead! He had three more evil nights, and on each occasion he had forty men killed. These poor fellows all fell victims under the Dahoman cutlass in the month of October. And does not the blood of these poor fellows cry to the Christian English to hasten themselves for the rescue of the weak and innocent from the mighty? As soon as the custom is entirely finished, the lion of the Bights will be up to seek more poor fellows for his cutlass, or for the slavers, to obtain money. I believe Christian England will embrace all chance to make an end of the slave-trade. The King of Dahomey throws all the fault upon those who bring vessels to purchase slaves in his country; he would sell none if no vessel came to purchase. What will Christian England do to stop this trade? Just about a month ago an American schooner left Whydah with upwards of 200 slaves, although the ships of war have been watching the schooner as closely as they possibly could.

* **THE SLAVE-TRADE IN THE VOLTA.**: The intelligence we publish in this present number, of the lamentable extent to which this infamous traffic is carried on within and from the protected territories of the Gold Coast, will greatly afflict and surprise our friends. That we, too, should have our Whydah so near that of the King of Dahomey, is too horrible to think of. For the sake of a few paltry hundreds a-year, this country, which is spending half-a-million annually on the naval squadron for suppressing the slave-trade, delivers over the people of an extensive region to this monster enormity. We called attention, some twelve months ago, to the active operations of the slavetraders at Quittah, since the virtual abandonment of that place by the British authorities. We stated then that many hundred slaves, from Ashantee and the Volta districts, had passed Quittah by the Lagoons and sea coast for shipment, at a place nearer to the King of Dahomey's port of Whydah, which our readers will see in our Dahoman news the King calls "the English town of Whydah." And now it seems that so far from anything having been done by the British Government to put an end to such practices, the trade has gone on constantly increasing, until it has destroyed the legitimate commerce which before existed, and which ought to have been fostered with the extremest assiduity and care. What makes the matter more serious is, the declared inability of the authorities on the Gold Coast to take any efficient measures for remedying this great and crying evil.

But we are sure that our friends will agree with us in insisting, with Her Majesty's Government, that the evil shall be remedied, and that without further loss of time. The disgrace to this country is too flagrant for us to allow of its longer continuance. The sea coast and Lagoons, from Addah and Quittah to Whydah, are now the only seats of the slave-trade in the Bight of Benin. They must be robbed, if cavillers choose so to call it, of this evil distinction. We cannot afford to allow them longer to enjoy it. We have by it become really implicated as a nation in that slave-trade which we are, at the same time, making such expensive efforts to suppress. The proper re-occupation of Addah and Quittah would destroy the slave-trade up the Volta, and limit it on the coast to the Dahoman territory, until by negotiation, or other means, we can effect its discontinuance there, and thus purge the whole Bight of Benin of this accursed atrocity.
* **Hope in Dahomey**: 

she has been so richly endowed by nature. In this number of our journal we have also to record the painful news of an active foreign slave-trade at Whydah—of the shipment of nearly 1,000 poor wretches in one steamer, destined for the disgusting shambles of the modern plantations of Cuba, there to be used up in eight or ten years in the production of sugar for the British market. We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful "Customs" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty's Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott had been furnished by them with the presents that would be requisite should he attempt a visit to Abomey. And we know his earnest desire to detach the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade. We have, therefore, reason to believe that when he receives, by the mail which leaves Liverpool to-morrow, this interesting intelligence, which has been communicated through us, he will lose no time but proceed to Whydah as soon as his other duties will permit. The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him. The person whom he has named as interpreter should accompany the British negotiator. And then, should all fail—should no good result be obtained—we shall have at least the satisfaction that we performed our duty. We are not sanguine of any immediate good result, because we have no reason to believe that the negotiator has any power to promise a subsidy on the part of this country, which might compensate (until legitimate commerce should be largely developed) for the fancied pecuniary loss the King would sustain by the abandonment of the slave-trade. But we might expect to learn the amount of subsidy that would induce such abandonment; and it would then be for this country to determine whether it would be our duty or our interest to pay the price.
* **REVENUE OF LAGOS.**: 

We feel particularly interested in the prosperity of Lagos, not only because we advised its annexation as a death blow to the slave-trade influences that prevailed there, but because of the evidence it affords that, should it become absolutely necessary in the interests of civilization and humanity, as well as of trade and industry, to occupy Whydah, our occupation of that place need not entail any permanent charge upon the Imperial revenues. We do not hesitate to say that 20,000l. a-year might be levied by duties on imports at Whydah. We do not wish to prejudge the results of Captain Willmott's visit to Abomey. Our correspondent at Whydah tells us that there is hope of amicable relations with Dahomey, and of the slave-trade being put an end to there. We are only too willing to share in this hope. But we think it right to show that, should the hope not be realised, there are still means for annihilating the slave-trade in the Bight of Benin, without any very heavy charge upon the home exchequer. And annihilated in the Bight of Benin the slave-trade never will be, while Cuba continues to import slaves, until the shipment of slaves from Dahomey and along the coast to the Volta be rendered impossible by the constant influence of British authority there. It is estimated that the revenue of the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade, and from licenses to trade and export duties at Whydah, amounts to 500,000 dollars a-year. One merchant at Whydah pays him 20,000 dollars a-year for a license to trade. It would be absurd for us to shut our eyes to these facts. If we cannot obtain the discontinuance of slave importation in Cuba, we must put an end to slave exportation from the coasts of Dahomey. And we understand that although the Kings of Porto Novo and Badagry are no longer mixed up actually with the slave-trade, they allow it to be carried on by Portuguese at their towns. And this reminds us that we have never yet received any explanation as to the grounds upon which we levy duties at Badagry. We give in another column a copy of a protest sent to Governor Freeman by the merchants of Badagry, when the duties, since modified and amended, were first ordered to be levied there. We do not defend the language employed by the protesting parties. But it shows that they were smarting under a keen sense of wrong done to them, according to their belief. We are not in possession of the Governor's reply to that protest. We must presume it will have shown the grounds on which he justified his order, and treated Badagry as a British possession, by levying duties there in the Queen's name, at a time when there was actually a British Vice-Consul there. We are aware that since the publication of our October article the Vice-Consul has been converted into a resident British agent; that his brother has been appointed magistrate; that a force of twelve native policemen are placed at the service of these authorities; and that the King and chiefs relinquish all right to levy duties, in consideration of a certain annual sum to be paid them by the Governor of Lagos. But we do not know whether in the document relinquishing that right, or in any other, they acknowledge themselves subjects of Queen Victoria.
* **A Consul at Whydah**: One of our best and most dependable authorities on the West Coast in questions relative to Dahomey writes strongly by the last mail, urging upon us to persevere in our endeavours to obtain that a consul be accredited to the King of Dahomey, to reside in the British Fort at Whydah. He knows the Dahoman monarch, his country, and his people well. We are glad, therefore, to have this confirmation of the soundness of our views in urging Her Majesty's Government, as the African-Aid Society has done, to send a consul to Whydah.

Our correspondent says that he agrees entirely with what he has heard to be the opinions of Commodore Wilmot, who visited Dahomey in December and January last. He thinks "that England has not, as a nation, given Dahomey that share of its attention which its peculiar position and circumstances relative to the slave-trade and to Abeokuta has claimed." "The more I think," he says again, "of Dahomey, and of Commodore Wilmot's recent visit, the more deeply am I impressed with the idea that such a consular establishment as has been suggested is the great desideratum for the present. It would involve no idea of *force* or *coercion*, and lead to no political complication." He thinks the presence of a British consul there would rapidly lead to important agricultural and commercial results, which would soon weaken the *prestige* of the slave-trade in the minds of monarch and people, by opening to them other and better sources of national wealth.

The African-Aid Society has laboured continually for opening Dahomey to civilization and progress. It has always strongly recognised her great importance, both as regards the slave-trade—which her conversion to better practices would put an end to in the Bight of Benin—and also as regards the spread and increase of civilising commercial operations on the coast. We firmly believe that the time has nearly come when the great change we so desire, and have so ardently striven to procure, will take place in Dahomey. Our earnest desire is, and ever has been, that it may be a peaceful and orderly change; that we may have no occasion to deplore any event connected with it, save that it had been so long delayed.
* **SLAVE TRADE—CUBA**: Our readers may have perceived some allusions in the daily press to an event which had excited some remark in New York—viz., the extradition by the United States Government, at the request of the Cuban authorities, of Don José Augustin Arguelles, or Captain Arguelles. In order that this affair may be quite understood, we may state that the celebrated slave clipper steamer Ciceron landed a cargo of slaves in Cuba, from Dahomey, of from 1,200 to 1,300 individuals. They were landed in the district over which Mr. Arguelles exercised authority as lieutenant-governor. Arguelles captured the whole cargo, and with them Senor Zulueta and other powerful individuals who are engaged as capitalists in the nefarious traffic. These persons, although caught "in flagrante," although taken in the very act, have proved themselves to be sufficiently powerful to free themselves from all condemnation and to obtain the ruin of the man who had interfered with their unholy gains. There was a difference between the number of slaves seized and the number surrendered to the supreme authorities of the island. Zulueta and his worthy companions denounced Arguelles to the captain-general as having sold that number of slaves which constituted the difference alluded to. Arguelles maintains that the negroes thus deficient in the surrender were given by him to the parties to whom he is represented as having sold them—given by him for the aid and assistance rendered by those persons in effecting the capture, and as a price indeed agreed to be paid to them for that assistance. And considering the slave-trade morality of the island, this cannot be considered impossible. But as Zulueta and his brother slave-trade capitalists denounced Arguelles, so the persons who had thus received the slaves from Arguelles swore that they did not receive them as a gift, but that they paid from 700* to 750 dollars each for them, while Arguelles maintains that the only crime of which he has been guilty was in so far exceeding his instructions and the intentions of the chief authority, as to have captured such powerful people, such mighty slavetraders, as Zulueta and his friends. And we must say that the impunity which these people enjoy, although they were thus taken in the very act of having superintended the landing of the cargo, &c., of which they were proprietors, leads very strongly to the supposition, by those who know something of the purity of Spanish administration and of Spanish local law courts in such matters, that Arguelles may after all not be the guilty person he has been stated to be, and has been condemned as being. He is now a convict in the slave gang, while Zulueta and his friends are at liberty to arrange for retrieving the loss Arguelles inflicted on them in capturing an otherwise safely-landed cargo of 1,200 slaves, worth to them one million of dollars, or 200,000l.—to arrange for retrieving this by importing other cargoes in the Ciceron from Dahomey.
* **DAHOMEY**: The coast was being closely watched by the English war steamers, to prevent the shipment of slaves. It is, no doubt, a very trying service for both officers and men on such a coast—but the object in view is a great one, Dahomey having been of late years the only large shipper of slaves.

* **Parliamentary Intelligence**: 

Lagos. He went on to say that, in his opinion, Lagos should be given up at once, and that of Gambia but one fort should be retained. Inquiry was now asked for, and it was true that inquiry had taken place in former days. Two royal commissions had sat with reference to this subject, but it was not necessary to refer to the report that had been made by the commissioners. In 1842 a select committee sat, presided over by Lord Stanley, now the Earl of Derby, and their inquiry arose principally from the fact that on the Gold Coast, which was then in the hands of a company, British merchants were in the habit of supplying slavers with requisites for carrying on their trade. The committee came to a conclusion, on which the House acted, that the Crown should resume the government of the settlement, but the question now was, whether the evil which then existed did not still continue; whether, in fact, the interest of resident merchants was not opposed to the object with which this country maintained the settlement. Committees of this House and of the House of Lords, with the more general view of inquiring into the best means of suppressing the slave-trade, subsequently sat—the inquiry which was now asked for would have the effect of eliciting whether in point of fact the maintenance of the four settlements was effectual, and how far it was so, for the suppression of traffic in slaves. For his part, he considered that the principle which was found to operate in ordinary commercial matters applied also to the slave-trade—namely, that the supply was regulated by the demand. (Hear, hear.) As long as there was an active demand for slaves, so long would there be a supply. A blockading squadron might add to the difficulty of carrying on the trade, but could not stop it. That was in fact beginning at the wrong end. The way to put down the trade effectually was to stop the demand for slaves. (Hear, hear.) He was happy to say that the demand was now confined solely to Cuba, and he believed that if pressure were put upon Spain to stop that demand, the slave-trade would be finally extinguished. It was a curious fact that the King of Dahomey saw that point much more clearly than Lord Russell did. The noble lord, in his instructions to Captain Burton last year, when that officer was about proceeding on a mission to Dahomey, said, "Remind the King that he himself suggested that if we wished to put a stop to the slave-trade, we should prevent white men coming to buy them—(hear, hear)—and you will state that Her Majesty's Government, having determined that the traffic shall cease, will take steps effectually to stop the export of slaves." The step suggested by the King of Dahomey will be found much more effectual in achieving that most desirable end than those adopted at great expense by this country. (Hear, hear.) He (Mr. Adderley) believed that before many years the Governments of America, France, and England would combine to put a pressure upon Spain that she could not resist, and that their efforts, which had been long and ineffectually made for the suppression of a nefarious system, would be followed by the adoption of a course which in one hour would crowned with success. He was glad to observe that the Spanish minister at Madrid was reported to have said that stringent measures were about to be adopted for the suppression of the slave-trade. If that promise were carried out the day was not distant—a day they would all rejoice to see—when the slave-trade would forever cease to exist. (Hear, hear.) But suppose that that day had arrived, with what object would the four settlements to which he had referred be maintained? Two objects had been assigned. One was for the promotion of legitimate commerce, and the other for the civilisation of the native races. With reference to the first, he very much doubted that the object in view would be realised by the means suggested, and he confidently appealed to the honourable member for Manchester (Mr. Bazley), and the honourable member for Salford (Mr. Cheetham), whether, representing as they did the trade associations of Manchester, they were not of opinion that the maintenance of the settlement would rather retard than promote legitimate commerce. The second was entirely a philanthropic object, and, if it could be achieved, he did not think any one in the House would complain of the keeping up of the settlement; but did the experience of the past afford encouragement for the future? In his opinion it did not. Missionary effort and voluntary action had been to some extent successful, but he was fortified by the opinion of one of the most experienced African missionaries that the existing governments planted by Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa were not any protection or assistance to missionaries. What course, then, ought the country to adopt? It was clear that we must go forward or go back; something more or less than had been heretofore done should be resolved on as the policy for the future. Either we must render our Government secure by the sending out of larger forces, the opening up of the country, the making of roads, and the extending of our power, or we must do much less than is done at present, and stand out of the way of the native chiefs, who, if we were not there, would have full control over their own subjects. The committee of 1842 led to the formation of four insignificant Governments, so small, that it might have been anticipated that they would have been jealous of each other, and instead of co-operating to effect the great object in view, were inclined rather to counteract each the operation of the other. It was, he thought, worthy of inquiry whether the present state of things should longer be allowed to exist, whether the Governments should not be concentrated, and our engagements and responsibilities contracted. On these grounds, therefore, he asked the House to grant the inquiry for which he sought, for the sake of the more effectual carrying out of the three great objects to which he had alluded—namely, the suppression of the slave-trade, the promotion of legitimate commerce, and the civilisation of the natives; be called on them to inquire whether the present system of government on the West Coast of Africa was working satisfactorily. (Hear, hear.)
* **COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL. ORD, THE COMMISSIONER APPOINTED TO INQUIRE INTO THE CONDITION OF THE BRITISH SETTLEMENTS ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.**: As the introduction of legitimate commerce furnishes a safer and more remunerative occupation to the negro than he derives from trafficking in slaves, it will no doubt suggest itself as one cause for this banishment of slavery from the neighbourhood of the settlements, but experience shows that commerce is in itself powerless to produce this result. Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.

Thus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.

It is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.
* **DAHOMEY**: The King having been so successful in his expedition, the last great horrible custom is about to be performed—that is, the Gie-hole, or "Beadshouse," is to be erected on the grave of the King's deceased father. It will be a sort of monument to the father—a circular wall about six feet high, covered in with a grass roof, on the top of which will be placed a large silver bird, or lion, or imitation of some other animal. There is a similar "Beadshouse" over the graves of all the former Kings of Dahomey. Every King of Dahomey, after *finishing the funeral customs* of the deceased king, must build one of these houses—a monument of great value—over his grave. This is what the King is now about to do, and shows that the funeral customs are all ended except this last horrible one. You will see how horrible, when I tell you that *the mud for building the wall must be mingled with human blood as well as water*; and a great many precious beads are thrown into the mud. The King and some specially-selected persons must mingle this mud and build this wall. It is supposed that all the residents here will be called up to see the thing done. It is mostly the blood of the bitterest enemies that is used for this mud wall, but the Abeokutans have escaped from paying this terrible tribute of blood. The King would, no doubt, have built his wall last year with their blood, if he had taken Abeokuta, as he hoped to do.

Mr. Craft, of the Company of African Merchants here, has been sent for up to Abomey by the King on business matters.

The intention to send ambassadors to England is still entertained, and I do hope the slave-trade and many other abominable things will soon be no longer heard of any more here.

Yours,

V.
* **WHYDAH**: If, as is generally believed, it is a British characteristic to be unable to stand idly by while murder or outrage is being committed, then the town of Whydah, on the West Coast of Africa, is no place for natives of this country to settle in. It is situated within the territory of the King of Dahomey, who, in the beginning of July, holds his annual butcheries of prisoners and slaves; and it is one of the crotchets of this grotesque monster to compel the heads of the European mercantile houses in Whydah to attend these feasts of blood at Abomey, his capital, on pain of having their factories or places of business closed, and being forced to quit the country. The European residents in Whydah, French and German as well as Portuguese, are very indignant at being compelled to witness these atrocities, and are anxious that England should occupy Whydah. This would be no difficult task, as it has British possessions on both sides of it, and, besides, the Dahoman monarch has become thoroughly afraid of the British Power since it crushed the Ashanti kingdom, which his grandfather, his father, and himself had in vain tried to conquer. The European residents are also very desirous that...

something should be done to put a stop to these annual massacres. Several of the British merchants in Whydah appear to think that a peremptory message to the King of Dahomey would, in his present temper, be sufficient, the more especially as it is the abolition by the British Government of the slave-trade on the West Coast of Africa that has led to prisoners being slaughtered, now that they cannot be sold.
* **The West Coast of Africa and the Slave Trade**: It has long been the custom for England to bear the brunt of the work and the principal part of the expense involved in acting as the police of the seas for the suppression of the slave trade. In more than one sea—notably on the Western and Eastern Coasts of Africa—it has been usual, during the past two generations, for British squadrons to be stationed for the express purpose of crushing the horrible traffic in human flesh. Little now-a-days, however, is heard of the doings of our fleet engaged in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans; and there are Englishmen who appear to be under the impression that a permanent stop has long been put to the trade in negro slaves. That such a notion is very far from the truth is only too clear, not only from certain official documents, but from the constant notices appearing in the local press published in the colonies on the Gold Coast. The Lagos Observer, for instance, announced in its issue of January 7 that no less than 700 negroes have just been deported as slaves from Whydah to St. Thomas, in South Africa. A few months before 1,200 slaves were "openly shipped in the face of day by the Portuguese to the same place," under the pretext that they had been redeemed, and "would be treated on their return as emigrants." The King of Dahomey is the great sinner who profits by this unholy trade. As our contemporary remarks, the plausible plea under which the slave business is being encouraged and continued offers "a powerful incentive to the King of Dahomey to prosecute vigorously his annual raids in the interior" of the continent. Such facts should stimulate others, too, in their efforts for the final suppression of this unhallowed traffic.
* **West African Telegraph Company**: At the eighth ordinary general meeting of shareholders, held on July 13, the Chairman (Sir John Ponder) pointed out that the gross revenue for 1892 amounted to £60,293 as against £60,214 in 1891, showing an increase of £709. The receipts from Portuguese stations show a falling off, which, however, is balanced by a corresponding increase in the guarantee received from Portugal. The receipts from French stations, owing to military operations in Dahomey, show an increase. The Capo joint-purse receipts also show an improvement, but owing to the falling-off in the traffic with South America and British stations, and also to the fact that we are making a comparison with a period when we carried a large amount of British traffic during the interruption of the African Direct Company's Lagos-Accra cable, the net increase in revenue is, as already mentioned, £509. We have again made a very heavy loss on exchange, which affects our revenue by over £8,000. The Portuguese Government have sanctioned our collecting at a higher rate on certain classes of traffic, but they have not admitted the principle of allowing us to collect at the higher rate on the whole traffic. The bulk of this loss is made in the remittance of the amount paid to us in Portugal by the Government on account of the guarantee. The total working expenses for 1892 amounted to £20,019, against £20,883, or a decrease of £864. We have, unfortunately, had to effect an exceptional number of repairs. The work has been carried out by the Eastern and the Eastern & South African Companies' ships at actual cost, but notwithstanding this arrangement, the expense has been very considerable—so much so, indeed, that the Directors consider it advisable to carry forward the small balance of £2,410 without distributing anything in the way of dividend. We have been obliged, since the date of these accounts, to incur further heavy expenses in connexion with the repair of the cable off the mouth of the Congo, but I trust when the work is carried out we shall be relieved from expenses of such an exceptional nature for some years to come. As a large proportion of revenue is derived from the joint-purse arrangement for the Cape traffic, it is essential that we maintain our link in the route to the Cape in a state of efficiency. The expenses in connexion with the diversion of our cable beyond the influence of the currents of the Congo will involve a considerable burden on this Company for some time to come, but we are convinced that this course will prove the most economical one, and be in the best interests of the Company. The most rigid economy is practised in management, and we look forward hopefully to better results in the future. These are the real facts of the case. The fact of this Company practically completing the cable system round Africa was always looked forward to with a great deal of satisfaction, and it is with much regret, therefore, that I am obliged to say we are not in a position to pay a dividend. There are two circumstances which have been against us, one of which is the heavy amount we lose by exchange. It is a very serious amount for a small Company like this, and we are trying to persuade the Portuguese Government to enable us not only by their own action in regard to the Government messages, but also with respect to the general messages, to recoup ourselves for the heavy loss we are now sustaining. The Government have refused to make any change in regard to their own messages, which I regard as an unfair view to take, and not in accordance with a strict reading of the agreement with the Government. We shall not fail to keep pressing on them to do us full and fair justice. The next important difficulty we have had to contend with, and which we have gone into most carefully, is in regard to the diversion of the cable mentioned in the report off the river Congo. We have decided to divert that cable, which at the present moment crosses the mouth of the Congo. We find there are under-currents in such rivers which we cannot understand, and their influence is injurious. We have, therefore, decided to carry this cable about 140 miles out to sea, so as to be free of the action of these under-currents. The removal will cost a good deal of money, but we hope it will enable us to give a certain service, and to secure the company from interruptions and breaks.

## The passage suggests that Christian England and other nations have a moral obligation to intervene and abolish the slave trade in East Africa, viewing it as essential for aligning with a vision of moral purity and advancing Christian civilization and industrial progress.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the claim that Christian England and other nations felt a moral obligation to intervene and abolish the slave trade in East Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the role of the humanitarian spirit and evangelical movement in advocating for abolition, driven by a vision of moral purity and the propagation of Christianity. It notes that abolitionists aimed to regenerate Africa through Christianity, civilization, and legitimate commerce, reflecting a moral and civilizational mission. Missionaries, often acting as agents of European colonialism, encouraged European intervention as a morally justified undertaking, particularly from the 1870s onwards. However, the textbook also points out that economic and industrial progress, stemming from the Industrial Revolution, played a significant role in changing attitudes towards the slave trade, as new productive capacities made slave labor less profitable, indicating that motivations were not solely moral or religious but also economic. In parallel, The African Times articles strongly support the claim by emphasizing the moral obligation of Great Britain to take decisive action against the slave trade, describing it as a "devastating and brutalizing curse" and a "disgrace to Christendom." The articles criticize the British Government for its perceived inaction and call for a more vigorous effort to end the trade, highlighting the moral imperative to protect human lives and advance Christian civilization. They also mention the successful signing of a treaty by the Sultan of Zanzibar to abolish the slave trade, indicating international efforts to address the issue. Both sources align closely with the claim, advocating for moral responsibility and intervention to eradicate the slave trade in East Africa, while also acknowledging the intertwined economic and moral motivations behind the abolitionist movement.

* **The Western impetus for abolition**: Throughout the eighteenth century, as they polished up their definition of the universal human right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness, anthropologists, philosophers and theologians came up against the case of the African and his condition in the world. Their thinking led them to modify the ideas commonly accepted until then about the African black and the American slave, and they transformed the brute beast of burden into a moral and social being. Their slogan, 'The Negro is a man', implicitly impugned the generally held view about the propriety, legality and use› fulness of selling black Africans. Their humanitarian arguments led to a demand for abolition, since the balance sheet of the trade consisted, as they saw it, entirely of debits.
It bled the states that encouraged and subsidized it; it killed tens of thousands of whites and hundreds of thousands of blacks; and it took people who were both producers and consumers away from their lands and reduced them to slavery in America, i.e. to ciphers. It prevented the diversification of trade on the African coast. It perpetuated barbarism in the black continent - this being the view of the only Westerners credited with knowing about Africa, the slave-traders. While denouncing the scourge, abolitionists did not seek or expect to convert black traders or white pro-slavers straightaway. They put forward a programme for the regeneration of Africa through Christianity, civilization, and normal trade, and proposed rational stages for its implementation: public opinion in the Christian world to be changed, the so-called 'civilized' governments to be persuaded to adopt official positions, and the Atlantic trade to be legally abolished.
* **Increased European pressures**: Direct European pressures in East Africa between 1845 and 1884 revolved around four interlinked activities: the abolition of the slave trade, propa› gation of Christianity, geographical exploration and the establishment of 'legitimate commerce'. These four activities were interlinked in the sense that they were a product of the European capitalist expansion coming out of the Industrial Revolution. This developed new productive capacities that made slave labour less profitable and therefore produced new attitudes towards the slave trade. The so-called humanitarian spirit had already successfully persuaded Western countries to abolish the Atlantic slave trade and by the 1840s attention had been directed to the East African slave trade. Likewise, the evangelical movement associated with the humanitarian forces was, by the mid-nineteenth century, turning towards East Africa, partly because geographical exploration (itself a product of this new spirit of scientific curiosity and evangelism) was revealing challenging oppor› tunities for action against the evils of the Arab slave trade through mission› ary work and through the establishment of 'legitimate commerce'.
The words 'legitimate commerce' were used to refer to trade in com› modities other than human beings. However, we saw how ivory became one of the most important commodities for international trade in East Africa during the period under discussion. After the transfer of Seyyid Sard's capital from Oman to Zanzibar, the major Western powers of the time - Britain, the USA and France - established trade missions in Zanzibar. Yet, as we have already seen, most of the ivory trade still passed through Bombay before going to Europe because of the predominance of Indian merchants in the East African trade. Nevertheless, in terms of Western imperialism, the East African trade was already within the informal empire$^{47}$ of the West under the leadership of the British, whether operating directly from Zanzibar or indirectly through Bombay. Agents of American and German (Hamburg) firms dealing in cheap calico and hardware respect› ively carried a smaller volume of trade than that controlled by the Indian merchants.$^{48}$ This kind of commercial relationship continued undisturbed until near the end of the period under discussion.
* **The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa**: The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began. As European nations increasingly became interested in the acquisition of African territories, the missionaries paved the way in some areas of Africa and served, quite consciously, as agents for European colonialism. Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans. Missionaries therefore enthusiastically encouraged European intervention as a morally justified undertaking, especially from the 1870s onwards.
* **The Western impetus for abolition**: In France in the eighteenth century the Grande EncyclopØdie and the works of the AbbØ Raynal, with revisions by Diderot, taught bourgeois revolutionaries a disgust for slavery. This current of lofty secular thought supported from a distance the ideals of the SociØtØ des Amis des Noirs (Society of Friends of the Blacks), which was rumoured to be in the pay of the British. There, revolutionaries were sensitive neither to the realities of the slave trade nor to the need for popular support for their new ideology. In Britain, on the other hand, ordinary folk were educated in philanthropy through theological exposition based on a vigorous evangelical revival. The American Quakers, having themselves forsworn dealing in slaves, had already persuaded British Quakers to join the British movement for abol› ition.$^{1}$ At the same time political circles were subjected to indoctrination. The Clapham Sect was the spearhead of this two-pronged attack, and spoke up for it year after year in the House of Commons through the mouth of William Wilberforce. The fight against the array of obstacles set up by slave-owners and traders lasted twenty years, but on 25 March 1807 Britain abolished the trade. This was the second official abolition, following that of Denmark in 1802. In 1808 the USA gave general effect to the Quakers' individual decisions. This movement by governments to adopt the humanitarian cause was championed by Britain, whose slave-traders had shipped some 1 600 000 Africans to its American colonies during the previous century.
* **Protecting new trade**: Unlike the Roman Catholic ones, the Protestant missions sought tem› poral influence. They conceived of the Christianity they were propagating as a whole that included education, culture, class affiliation and political choice. They spread arithmetic and spoken and written English among people who had long been self-taught. Specialists came from Sierra Leone to teach architecture, printing and medicine. Learning belonged to the people who attended the missions, and the advantages that came from taking part made them into a privileged class. But they conformed to a pattern already familiar to the local chiefs, not all of whom approved. Some, however, paraded a superficial Westernization in their dress, their homes, their food and drink and their way of life. The missions' purpose was to create a middle class in order to cream off an elite, which would then be trained on Western lines, and would secure and expand the twoway flow of trade to and from the coast. The spread of civilization would be an incidental by-product which the palm-oil trade, limited to coastal transactions, could not achieve on its own. 47 Thus the Protestant missions, very much of this world, took on the role of reformers, which included interfering in political and military strategy. The Abeokuta missionaries suggested to England the making of a road to the sea, in order to speed up the barter trade - and the delivery of war material. They invoked the technical help of British troops against Dahomey. At Calabar their influence in the city-states secured by agree› ment the ending of local customs that they considered objectionable. From their position of strength, the missions did not object to the rival intrusion of Western administrations, but counterbalanced it by siding with or against the established trade. Around 1850 the missions, together with the traders and the political administration, became involved in an irreversible process leading to an early form of colonial rule. The appointment of consuls with expansionist views went hand in hand with armed blockades and the establishment of protectorates. The excuse given by international diplomacy was always that such actions were aimed at the radical and final suppression of the slave trade. Humanitarian methods had become the instruments of economic, military and political power.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Evangelical Christianity**: Evangelical Christianity, in whose eyes the Origin of Species was damnable heresy, had no qualms, nevertheless, in accepting its racial implications. The racial content of evangelical Christianity was, however, tempered with a generous dose of humanitarian and philanthropic zeal - sentiments wide› spread among European policy-makers during the conquest of Africa. It has been argued, therefore, that the partition of Africa was due, in no small measure, to a 'broader missionary' and humanitarian impulse which aimed at the regeneration of African peoples. ' ' It has been asserted, more› over, that it was the missionaries who prepared the ground for the im› position of colonialism in East and Central Africa as well as in Madagascar. ' 2 Although it is true that missionaries did not resist the conquest of Africa, and that they did, in some areas, actively pursue that conquest, the missionary factor cannot be sustained as a general theory of imperialism because of its limited application.
* **Conclusion**: Thus in contrast to the arguments put forward on national and individual grounds by Western supporters of slavery, the abolitionist doctrine intro› duced the notions of treating African slaves as men and of opening Africa to the world. Around 1870 it achieved its aims: apart from rare exceptions, the Atlantic slave trade was at an end. This outcome was not the unilateral achievement of the West, which for a long time dragged its feet and even now was still not altogether convinced that the means expended in the cause of universal morality would pay off. In a way, an equal effort was made by the Africans of the hinterland and the coast. In difficult domestic circumstances, they managed at one and the same time to resist economic disintegration and to adjust rapidly to innovation. The African reaction to the abolitionist hypothesis showed tremendous adaptability and speed. For the time being, this was as important a factor in achieving abolition as were Western decisions. As for the new approach by the West, it stemmed from the white man's inability to conceive of the existence of values other than his own. His interest in African civilization was that of a scientist in a laboratory specimen. After a century of the battle for abolition, the con- science of the West was clear: and hence it felt free to impose its own values, by force if need be. Not everything was on the debit side. Changes did occur, and cracks appeared in the structure, so that it often crumbled away or was torn down, leaving clear the way ahead.
* ****: Abolitionist ideology was not African in inspiration. It was directed against the world of Atlantic slave-owners and slave-traders, before any interest was shown in the effects of the trans-Saharan or Arab trade. The forms it took rested on a foundation of moral philosophy whose efficacy as a driving force was very limited. Yet, for half a century, the anti-slavery movement and 'civilized' Africa officially backed mounting Western pres› sure on the West African coast. Around i860, the West began establishing for good a presence on the coast that had hitherto been sporadic, secondary and sometimes prohibited. Similar trends developed in North and East Africa from 1830 until the end of the century.
* **The Western impetus for abolition**: Proposals for collective abolition, put forward by Britain in 1787 and again in 1807, came to nothing. In 1810 Portugal made some vague promises in return for the entry of its goods to the British market. With the ending of the Napoleonic Wars a world was crumbling in ruins. The peace of 1815 opened the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic to maritime trade; and to the transport of slaves. At the Congress of Vienna, British diplomacy sought an explicit condemnation of the trade, but all it obtained was an empty, procrastinatory declaration, reaffirmed at Verona. From 1841, this pretence of official abolitionist morality gave the British Foreign Office and the Admiralty all the authority they needed for their combined strategies in regard to the international slave trade. This was a radical three-point plan of action: domestic legislation making it illegal for nationals of the country concerned to engage in the traffic; bilateral treaties giving navies the reciprocal right to search and seize at sea merchant vessels of either contracting nation caught in the illegal trade; and collaboration through mixed commissions, empowered to adjudicate on captured slave ships and set free the slaves found on board. The same provisions were also applicable in the Indian Ocean, especially between Mauritius and Bourbon (the island now known as RØunion).
* **The Western impetus for abolition**: Politically stronger states reacted differently to British pressure. France, eager for prestige, maintained its freedom of action by a pretence at legislation and by naval suppression patrols which remained innocuous in home waters for as long as they did on the coast. Between 1815 and 1830 the French illicit trade fitted out 729 slaving expeditions for the west and east coasts of Africa. But when it became clear that such operations no longer benefited French ports either financially or socially, the government signed a reciprocal search agreement. Another reason was that the mon› archy that emerged after the 1830 revolution felt it desirable to gain Britain's goodwill.$^{7}$ This volte-face by the French resulted in several small countries acceding to the 1831-3 agreements. Britain took the opportunity to renew its attempts to internationalize the issue, and extended its naval suppression to cover the whole of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. An 'equipment' clause in the treaties allowed the seizure of ships obviously equipped for the slave traffic, even though not carrying human cargoes. But the slave ships of the USA remained exempt. For forty years American diplomacy managed to evade any serious commitment. In 1820 the trade was legally equated with piracy; in 1842 came the compromise of'checking the flag', which protected the Americans from British suppressive action; and 80-gun suppression squadrons served to safeguard national pride whilst at the same time remaining mere formalities. In the 1840s the Southern planters called for the legal reopening of the trade, and meanwhile took to breeding slaves for the home market on special ranches.$^{8}$ During the Civil War the Lincoln administration committed itself to the right of search, which had been in abeyance since 1820. The American trade then stopped.
Thus for half a century the proliferation and accumulation of documents testify mainly to the emptiness of the undertakings entered into. Through› out all this avalanche of words, Africa and the Africans were hardly ever mentioned, just as though they did not exist. Shipping agents benefited from the illicit trade, making bigger profits than during the period of legally protected trade,$^{9}$ while the slave plantations stockpiled manpower.
* **Protecting new trade**: Buxton's ideas were fermenting among the Protestant missions, and with the success of Sierra Leone and the liberated Africans they gained able apologists in the field. Some of these were professionals like Samuel Ajayi Crowther, who was enslaved at 15, liberated, and became a pastor, bishop and nation-builder. Others were engaged in legitimate trade. Most were emigrants returning to their areas of origin, where they helped the missions and prepared the ground for them. The missionaries themselves settled on the littoral between the Gold Coast and Cameroon, except in the kingdom of Benin and found themselves among peoples that were devoutly religious but faced with political 'crises of adjustment'. They arrived at Badagry in 1842, at Whydah in 1843 and at Calabar in 1846. Their bridgehead in the interior was the large town of Abeokuta, in the new Egba country.
* **The process of suppression**: Abolitionists argued that without buyers of slaves there would be no sellers. Supporters of slavery reversed the order of the terms, arguing that without a supply of slaves from Africa there would be no demand for them in the West: their consciences were clear, in the light of the tacit complicity of Africa itself.
* **The Western impetus for abolition**: The hagiography that portrays humanitarian revolution as opening 'one of the noblest pages in English history' received a severe blow in 1944 from an analysis written from the standpoint of historical materialism. According to Eric Williams, abolition represented primarily the working out of the economic imperatives of Britain as a budding industrial country.$^{2}$ It is true that this seminal approach did not entirely deny the role played by moral philosophy and an idealistic and triumphant humanitarianism. Nonethe› less, it drew attention to certain serious contradictions between the theories and the realities. Among the most prominent leaders of the abolitionist movement there were many bankers (the same was true of the French SociØtØ des Amis des Noirs), which showed that the capitalist class had much to gain from having the trade abolished. The theories of the abol› itionists at the time proved powerless against the reality of the very strong current of trade to flourishing slave plantations in Cuba and Brazil. Nor were the so-called humanitarian forces capable of controlling the effects of the standardization of import duties on sugar, which ultimately led, as was to be expected at a time when the mechanization of plantations was still far from complete, to an increase in the demand for black manpower. Perhaps the chief merit of Williams's stimulating thesis was to provoke further research, as the economic debate still continues. Thus, Seymour Drescher has set about demonstrating that abolition was 'econocide', and Roger Anstey argued that British philanthropy was rooted in faith and benevolence.$^{3}$ There is perhaps less disagreement among historians as to the political factors involved in abolition.
* **Implications of incorporation**: A word should be added about one more sugar-producing area, this one in Africa: Mauritius. The British duty was lifted in 1826 and sugar rapidly dominated all island production. Slavery was in theory abolished in 1835 and slaves were replaced by Indian contract labourers. Nonetheless an illegal slave trade continued to flourish. These slaves, however, came from the external arena, East Africa. See B. Benedict, 1965, pp. 12-19; E. A. Alpers, 1975, p. 214. accumulators who were negatively affected by this change. It was also, it should be added, a policy that was enforced in a flexible manner. Where the plantations were non-British but direct supply zones for British manu› facturing interests, Great Britain tended to 'condone' slavery. One instance was the American South. A second was Cuba and Brazil, which continued through most of the nineteenth century to obtain slaves from the still permitted trade 'south of the line', where the economies of the slave trade remained different, as we indicated above. 44 The nineteenth century up to Partition was, it has been argued, the era of 'informal empire' or the 'imperialism of free trade'. J. Gallagher and R.› Robinson summed up this analysis: 'By informal means if possible, or by formal annexations when necessary, British paramountcy was steadily upheld.'$^{45}$ Free trade is a term too easily thrown around. We should be clear that traders tend to favour free trade if they have a competitive advantage in the market and tend to see ways of restraining free trade if and when they do not. Hence the fact that the role of the chartered companies in eighteenth-century West Africa was less than in the seven› teenth century has led some historians to speak of the rise of free trade. The very process of dismantling of the monopoly powers of chartered companies was however 'a gradual one', we are told; the shift to free trade 'was therefore somewhat limited'; and the explanation of the shift resided primarily in 'practical business reasons', to wit, the lower overhead costs and greater flexibility of response to an expanding slave-trade market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in
* **Capitalist expansion**: Since much of Africa's 'international' commerce prior to this point was in the slave-trade, and incorporation was accompanied by the abolition of the slave trade, incorporation has often been discussed as the shift from the slave trade to 'legitimate' commerce. To use this ideological language of the period is however to be somewhat misleading, as can be seen if we look at northern or southern Africa, not to speak of those non-African parts of the world which were incorporated at the same time into the capitalist world-economy. The decline of the slave trade, important as it was, was secondary to the generalized need of the capitalist world-economy for new areas of low-cost production, as part of the general expansion of its level of economic activity and rate of accumulation.
* **Protecting new trade**: The coast had always exported palm oil, but in minute quantities. Imports into Britain rose from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21 000 tonnes in 1844, levelled off for ten years or so, and then doubled by 1870. France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade.
* **African reactions**: Cliometricians, sociologists and historians agree that the slave trade was a complete catastrophe for Africa. Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered. Certain individuals with strong personalities were able to consolidate their power, men like Tippu Tip, for instance, or Rabeh. But any benefits that may have been conferred on the regions under their control still have to be identified by specialists.

* **More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey**: In this custom he has to pass the furniture round the market, just the same as the other, and before doing the night previous must be evil night. The evil night carried away thirty-two. Two small trees were transplanted to the palace gate that night, and on each of these trees hung eight heads of the men killed in the night, as the fruits of the trees. Although this custom has nothing to do with a platform, he erected one; and on this he formed some stick-work, and laid a man on them, well fastened, and covered him with white baft, and saddled him; which was to imply that his late father rode on so high a white horse, that he saw everything in the world; that there was nothing hid from him. He also bound two men close to the poor fellow as his ostlers. All were left there until they were dead! He had three more evil nights, and on each occasion he had forty men killed. These poor fellows all fell victims under the Dahoman cutlass in the month of October. And does not the blood of these poor fellows cry to the Christian English to hasten themselves for the rescue of the weak and innocent from the mighty? As soon as the custom is entirely finished, the lion of the Bights will be up to seek more poor fellows for his cutlass, or for the slavers, to obtain money. I believe Christian England will embrace all chance to make an end of the slave-trade. The King of Dahomey throws all the fault upon those who bring vessels to purchase slaves in his country; he would sell none if no vessel came to purchase. What will Christian England do to stop this trade? Just about a month ago an American schooner left Whydah with upwards of 200 slaves, although the ships of war have been watching the schooner as closely as they possibly could.

* **LETTERS OF DR. LIVINGSTONE AND THE EAST AFRICA FOREIGN SLAVE TRADE.**: It is with a strange mixture of sensations that we have heard from Dr. Livingstone. Our joy—and it was a great joy—came not unmixed with annoyance; annoyance the more poignant, because we were at the same time filled with admiration of the American gentleman who had dashed away the cobwebs of Zanzibar delusion, which for four long years had hidden the loved and honoured explorer from our sight; and had restored him once again to our eager and delighted gaze. While we shout, "Honour, all honour, to the enterprising and intrepid Mr. Stanley, and to the liberality of his New York patron," we cannot avoid a feeling of natural humiliation, that England should have been in this instance so unwisely or lukewarmly served, as to have made this country dependent on American agency, for that intelligence from Dr. Livingstone, which we were all so painfully anxious to receive. When we think of all that has been attempted by the British Government and the Royal Geographical Society of London, for the relief and succour of the great traveller; that all those efforts have been futile; that through the British Consul at Zanzibar, we could get no certain information from the Doctor, no relief to him during four long, long years; until hope was nearly dead in our hearts, and fear that we should never again hear of him alive was well-nigh victorious within us; and that now we are indebted to the spirited enterprise of the proprietor of a New York newspaper, the official zeal and intelligence of the United States' Consul at Zanzibar, and the persistent and undaunted energy of an American citizen, Mr. Stanley, for the knowledge of his being still alive; and for his having been so abundantly succoured that he is able to renew his interesting and important researches in the great lake districts of Central Africa,—we feel that there must have been great faults somewhere; and that some one must be guilty in the matter. We shall not ourselves pretend to decide who has been to blame. Heavy charges are brought against Dr. Kirk, the British Consul at Zanzibar, by Mr. Stanley, a Mr. Fraser, and others; and it does seem to require explanation, how and why it happened, that not one message could be got to Dr. Livingstone by Dr. Kirk during those four anxious years; while thirteen messages and reliefs were successfully sent by the American Consul to Mr. Stanley during his perilous expedition in search of and his stay with the Doctor. If this turn out to be another case of British official incapacity, we can only deeply deplore that it should have been located on the East Coast of Africa at so very important a period. But turning from this disagreeable subject to the Doctor's characteristic letters, how wide a field for Christian sympathy do they exhibit! We are not at all inclined to sit quiescently before it, and cry, "Alas, alas!" in hopeless despair. To redeem those countries and their people from that devastating and brutalizing curse of the foreign slave trade, ought to be, and must be, the first practical effort made by Great Britain. Years and years ago, we called for increased determination, and better-planned and more liberally supported measures on the part of our Government, to relieve Eastern Africa from the desolating abomination. It was clearly of no use to write despatches to Zanzibar, and send an occasional cruiser to those Eastern shores. The work of murdering and enslaving still went on in those unhappy lands; and the Arab dhows still bore away their twenty thousand victims yearly up the Persian Gulf, for the supply of the adjacent Mahomedan countries. In this matter of the final suppression of the African slave trade, we seem to have fallen into an era of words—mere words. Instead of being invigorated by the victories we have, as a nation, achieved over that trade in Western Africa; and pushing on vigorously to final and complete conquest over the hideous East African branch of it, we have sunk to sloth and comparative indifference. The late debate in the House of Lords, and meeting at the Mansion House (see pages 20-21), has shown us evidence of a terrible national declension in this matter. The demon of money seems to have eaten up the Christian spirit; if it be true, as no doubt it is, that years have been wasted in a higgling dispute, as to whether the paltry sum of 8,000l. to the Sultan of Zanzibar, as the price of his compensation in putting a final end to the iniquitous and murderous traffic, should be paid exclusively out of the Imperial Treasury; or whether the Indian Treasury should share the burden. Is it not an awful national declension, that a mere 4,000l. a-year should be thought of more importance than the lives and liberties of the one hundred thousand victims which would have been spared but for that one year's false economy? Under such circumstances, Lord Stratheden refused, as we think very properly, to withdraw his motion. There has been, unhappily, but too much deference of late to official inertia and indifference. Government and Secretaries of State, even the best of them, require constant urging to do good. They are so much occupied with the daily cares of their existence, that they have not the time necessary, as it would appear, to estimate properly the relative value of 4,000l. and 100,000 human lives, and floods of tears and blood and misery and woe. There would seem to be some similitude in torpor, between Her Majesty's Government, as regards that accursed East African slave trade, and Dr. Kirk at Zanzibar, as regards the life and succour of the great exposer of the horrors of that inhuman traffic. As Mr. James Gordon Bennett and Mr. Stanley have electrified the latter into active life, so let us hope the Government will be electrified into activity by the attention now once again given to the horrible enormities practised by Arab and Banian slave dealers in Eastern Africa and on the Persian Gulf. Is the Christian heart of England asleep, or dead, that no universal shout of execration and demand of remedy is heard? and is there no Christian heart at all in the other so-called Christian countries of Europe? It seems to us something like nonsense to say that the East African slave trade cannot be put an end to without the co-operation of other Christian Powers. The supply of slaves from East Africa is now entirely for the Mahometan countries round the Persian Gulf; and no one else save these countries, the slave traders, and the Zanzibar authorities, have any interest in upholding it. Would that we could see evidence that the mantle of Lord Palmerston had fallen upon Earl Granville as regards the African foreign slave trade. He who, as one of the Government of this country, should be the means of destroying that accursed thing—the continuance of which is a disgrace to Christendom—will achieve a lasting and honourable fame. All that is required is a judicious boldness, in determination to effect the thing, and in supplying and applying the necessary funds for the purpose. There would possibly be some cavillers in the House of Commons against expenditure in this direction, but we feel sure that if the matter were rightly placed before the House and the country by members of the Government, there would be a public response, loud, general, and enthusiastic enough to bear the Ministry triumphantly through, even though hundreds of thousands of pounds were required for an immediate or a speedy attainment of the great object. Let the country at large become but once thoroughly aroused to the fact, that the accursed slave trade, within a very limited space in Eastern Africa, is consuming 100,000 human lives a-year, devastating and depopulating a fine country, and degrading and destroying its remaining people, in order that the Mahometan harems in Persia, &c., may have their yearly supply of slaves, and there will soon be an end to the abomination. We feel our own
* **SUPPRESSION OF THE EAST AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE**: A small paragraph of three lines in our last number indicated that a new effort was being made to bring the Sultan of Zanzibar to reason as regarded the Treaty for the suppression of the slave trade, offered to his acceptance by Sir Bartle Frere, and then rejected: "Admiral Cumming has been ordered to proceed to Zanzibar with all available naval force, and there await instructions." And this has been at once effectual. The Sultan, we are informed by telegram, has signed the Treaty, and the slave market was closed the same day. So far, good. A change had taken place at Zanzibar since the Sultan proved so intractable with Sir Bartle Frere. It will be remembered that the influence of the French Consular authorities had been employed to strengthen the Sultan in his ideas of resistance. Through their sinister efforts, France and the Sultan of Zanzibar were held up to the world as conjoint in the East African slave trade iniquity. This was too much. M. Thiers, then President of the French Republic, ordered an immediate change, and that French influence should be used the other way. M. Thiers would have joined England in coercion, if necessary; but the mere threat has been enough. The Sultan saw his game was played out—or the Arab slave traders did, which is the same thing—and the Sultan has accepted the Treaty. We presume this Treaty provides for the entire abolition of all slave importation from the mainland to Zanzibar. Nothing short of this will suffice. If the slaves already at Zanzibar be properly treated, their natural increase will supply all reasonable wants of the Sultan, and Zanzibar cultivation. Not one more African should be allowed to be brought to Zanzibar, and then, with due naval vigilance, the Arab slave trade on the East Coast will be at an end. But this is not all that was required as regards the East African slave hunts, and export slave trade. There are still the slave hunts to supply the trade carried on from the Portuguese territory, so called,—on which we remarked in our last, when reviewing Captain Sulivan's admirable work. We cannot allow the delegates of a Christian Power to carry on a trade which we have forcibly compelled the Sultan of Zanzibar to put an end to on that part of the coast where he has dominion. Let us rejoice over what has been done, but not relax our efforts until all shall have been accomplished. Ere long we hope our blessed Lord will descend as He ascended, and take upon Him His great name and rule; and we would not that any vestige of that horrible iniquity should at that time add its quota to the world's general pollution. As we have (it is to be hoped) destroyed it at Zanzibar and from Zanzibar, so must we obtain its destruction in and from those so-called Portuguese territories; and by those fearful slave caravans which cross the desert for the supply of Tripoli, Egypt, and Turkey. We must not rest till this be accomplished.

without payment, to every slave applying to the constituted authorities for it." (Pawns we regarded as slaves under another name.) "No fugitive slave shall ever again be compelled to return to his or her possessor, from whose service or control he or she has withdrawn. No sale or transfer of slaves should in any way be permitted or recognized. In case of death of a possessor, none of the slaves held by him or her should descend to the heir, or be allowed to be bequeathed, but should by that death become absolutely free." This was what we proposed, in order (as we at the time wrote) "to avoid risking the attendant evils which seem to us to be inseparable from a forcible general emancipation." We have had too much experience in public affairs to admit of our expecting at any time a full, heaped-up measure of satisfaction. If not a heaped-up measure, this at the Gold Coast was at least a tolerably well-filled one; and, as already stated, we were delighted. That delight, however, was but of short duration; and the temporary pain was the more bitter because of the general tone of the Governor's allocution. That tone was precisely what we should have desired it to be. We gave lately some extracts from accounts published by Mons. M. J. Bonnat, late captive at Kumasi. In a further paper he uses this expression, when giving his opinions as to what should now be done by the British Government in Ashanti: "All that is required is that England should speak with her great loud voice and say, 'Such is my pleasure!' (Je veux!) and she will be immediately obeyed. I know the Ashantees well. They have been defeated and conquered. They know this. They look upon both themselves and their country as now belonging to England. This sentiment of their position is in conformity with their laws; and they will be greatly astonished if England does not make them feel this." Mons. Bonnat would, no doubt, if asked, have added, "And this is true of all Africans; it is in the African nature." Governor Strahan's address was, therefore, as we fully agree with M. Bonnat, as above, in the right tone and spirit. What, then, was our dismay when we found it stated that, after deliberation among the Kings and Chiefs, and a discussion between them and the Governor, it was decided "that no slave could leave his or her master or mistress unless there was proof of cruelty or maltreatment, when such slave should be entitled to his or her freedom"! Where, alas! we exclaimed, is the "great loud voice" now? Was it, after all, only a vain and empty boast, with no intention on the part of the Governor, or the country that he represents, to insist on obedience? We saw before us the imperative duty of an earnest and determined protest; while our heart sank within us at the unavoidable conviction, that the reign of vacillation and weak and temporizing indecision was not yet at an end. If Great Britain, we exclaimed, will not insist on obedience now, when she has just bought these people and their land by an unsparing sacrifice of blood and treasure, what can we expect as the memory of this great purchase becomes dimmed by time? If no slave is to have his or her emancipation, except on proof before some legal authorities of cruelty or maltreatment, the "great loud voice" had better not have spoken at all, as it has only made itself ridiculous and worthy of contempt; since slavery, with all its attendant evils—its degrading, demoralizing, and civilization-impeding results—will be fixed more firmly than ever in the land. It is necessary that others should feel, as we feel, how almost insurmountable an impediment that slavery offers to the progress of Christian civilization and industrial development, before they can fully understand how great was our grief and disappointment. Happily, however, it did not endure. The noble lord the Secretary of State for the Colonies hastened to our relief. Lord Carnarvon must, we think, have felt something of the disappointment which had fallen so heavily on us; or at least he could not fail to perceive how supremely ridiculous such a speech as that of Captain Strahan to the assembled Kings and Chiefs must appear to every one, if only such results as had been reported were to be obtained—if so large a mountain as the British Government, after such dreadful throes of labour as were made known by Captain Strahan, should have produced only so very small a mouse. In the communication of Lord Carnarvon, which was distributed to the press some four-and-twenty hours after the publication of the Cape Coast report, we have the right issue set before us. There is to be no longer any impediment in the way of any Gold Coast slave or pawn, male or female, obtaining his or her entire freedom, at any time; and all sale or transfer of slaves is henceforth prohibited within the Protectorate (of course under severe penalties for transgressors.) It may be said by some that this could be a matter of very little importance, seeing that as slaves can at any time declare themselves free, no one would be likely to purchase. We do not agree with this view. The prohibition cannot be made too stringent, or be too widely and authoritatively proclaimed. It was indispensable that the Coast should know and feel that it had unconsciously entered on a new era; that the dignity of human nature would henceforth be jealously guarded and vindicated; that while we did not allow the people of the Protectorate to kidnap slaves from beyond the frontier, so neither could the predatory excursions of trans-frontier tribes be any more indirectly encouraged, through allowing or winking at the purchase of their miserable victims by persons under British rule, whether for fancied increase of dignity, or profit, or lust. While we rejoice at the change which the measures thus enunciated must produce; while we thank God that He has permitted us to see the fulfillment of this ardent desire of our heart (for any retrograde step, any going back, is for ever impossible); we cannot but feel that the Kings and Chiefs must have a very inadequate idea of the results that will flow from those measures. It had become so much the fashion to say that slaves were so much better off as slaves than they would be if free—that if set free, they would give themselves back again into slavery, merely that they might be sure of food,—that we have very little doubt that the slave-holders console themselves by the belief, that few of their slaves will claim the freedom now offered and secured to them; that although, theoretically, there is a great change, yet that, practically, things will go on pretty much as heretofore; that a succession of slaves will be raised out of the present stock, before the desire for freedom will enter into many hearts, or lead to any considerable emancipation. We are convinced that they will soon find themselves greatly mistaken. Freedom, secured by firm, just, and beneficent institutions, must, it is in the very essence of things, must be contagious, and speedily exert a contagious influence. While the atmosphere was slavery, sloth and unmanly dependence, with the most debasing female submission, were natural results. Now that the atmosphere is freedom, manly self-dependence and womanly self-respect, will as naturally be generated and produced. The ratio in which these new and noble qualities shall be produced will, of course, depend on the wisdom or otherwise of subsequent measures to be adopted and carried into execution by Government. If that step forward—that greatest step forward in the path of Christian civilization and industrial progress—were not to be followed by others in the same direction—if it were intended to be a mere spasmodic effort, made only to gratify and disarm a Christian feeling in England, and taken with the idea that Her Majesty's Government having thus washed their hands of the foul stain produced by connivance at slavery, and freed Great Britain from a deep reproach, no further interest would be taken in Gold Coast affairs, and nothing further need be done by that Government,—then, indeed, we should have to be prepared for slow results, for confusion, and disappointment. But the Christian people of Great Britain do not so understand the step thus taken by their Government, and the authorized exponent of their views and executor of their designs, on the Gold Coast. They expect, and will insist, that this first great step be resolutely followed up by others equally decisive, equally asserting supreme power to be exercised for the general good; and such as, in fact, are absolutely indispensable in view of the altered status of the great body of the population. We have indicated some of these when we were urging Her Majesty's Government to the great first step which they have now so happily taken. This having been made, we shall bring forward, without delay, our ideas as regards further and immediate progress. We hope to commence in this present number, which terminates the year 1874.
* **Abolition of Slavery in Brazil**: Would it were possible for our interior rulers to be present here on this occasion to witness this abolition festa; nevertheless, we trust that they will hear it and will be led to know that slavery is an evil characterizing nations in a state of barbarism, and must serve to convince us that Europe would never have attempted, much less have affected, the happy alterations which have taken place within her own limits and dominion had she not first received the humane doctrine of Christianity.

In doing honour, therefore, to the Emperor of Brazil, we can only say—

> City, country, all,  
> Is in gay triumph tempest toss'd;  
> We scarce could press along;  
> The trumpet's voice is lost  
> In loud, repeated shouts that raise

## The trade of diverse African commodities, including palm oil, cotton, palm kernels, ginger, and camwood, played a significant role in the economic interactions between Africa and Europe, underscoring Africa's integral position in global trade networks during the period described.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the trade of diverse African commodities, including palm oil, cotton, palm kernels, ginger, and camwood, played a significant role in economic interactions between Africa and Europe, underscoring Africa's integral position in global trade networks during the period described. The textbook highlights the production and export of primary products like palm oil, cotton, and palm kernels, emphasizing their centrality to Africa's integration into the capitalist world-economy. It notes the shift from the slave trade to cash-crop production, such as palm oil in the Niger delta and groundnuts in Senegambia, which contributed to income redistribution among ordinary people. Additionally, the increase in imports of European manufactured goods, particularly cotton goods, underscores Africa's role in global trade. However, the textbook does not specifically mention ginger and camwood, indicating a difference in the range of commodities discussed. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed evidence of the extensive trade activities involving all the commodities listed in the claim, including ginger and camwood. The articles highlight the demand and fluctuating prices of these commodities in European markets, with specific prices and quantities for palm oil, cotton, palm kernels, ginger, and camwood, further illustrating Africa's critical role in global trade. Together, these sources affirm Africa's significant economic interactions with Europe through the export of diverse commodities, although the textbook does not cover all the commodities mentioned in the claim.

* **Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops**: The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals. With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers. The family was the basic unit of production. It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.
Participation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock. First, it did not involve any fundamental technological innovation. Second, many of these crops or similar ones had been grown and processed long before the colonial era.
* **New economic trends**: In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.
Very well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.
Another consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.
* **The West African pattern**: One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life. Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.
The rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area. This production at first co-existed with the slave trade,$^{14}$ and later flourished on its own, until the boom came to an end in 1861, and finally declined at the end of the century.$^{15}$ The palm-oil trade similarly expanded in the Gold He finds the relevant consideration to be Europe's need of raw materials and points out the 'extraordinary demands on production' involved in the new amounts of palm oil, timber, and rubber exported. 'Many producers became involved in the harvest of the new commodities over wide areas.'
* **Increased European interest**: European trading influence spread much more quickly and more widely than missionary influence in the first half of the nineteenth century. This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power. Thus, the diversification of the items of trade without : substantial modification of the pattern of trade did not produce the economic and social revolution expected, at least not in the first half of the
* **The West African pattern**: Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded. In particular it seems that direct European involvement was counterproductive, as in the failed efforts at agricultural colonization in Waalo between 1819 and 1831,$^{21}$ and in the various efforts in Senegal, the southern Gold Coast, and Nigeria later on.$^{22}$ It was not that European personnel began to loom larger on the African scene; rather, the important change was that Europeans were largely displacing African merchants from The shift from the slave trade to palm oil strengthened the hand of private as against royal merchants (R. Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena. 'The bulking up, transporting and storage of commodities like palm oil and groundnuts, and the breaking down of imported goods into the quantities needed for many small producers, required more manpower than the trade in slaves'. See J. F. Munro, 1976, 47. the role of those in the port areas who purchased bulk items from traders who went into the interior and shipped them overseas, and vice-versa. 23 New export-oriented production necessarily implied new imports. The import of various European manufactures, particularly from Great Britain, multiplied throughout the nineteenth century. For example, cotton-goods
* **Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920**: African resistance helped substantially to dictate a slow pace of economic colonization for at least the three decades between 1880 and 1910. Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.
Production of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930. Cotton, palm oil, coffee, groundnuts and cocoa illustrate such characteristics in the parts of the continent with which they are respectively associated.
* **Central Africa in the fluctuating world economy of the nineteenth century**: During the centuries that saw the gradual establishment of a system in which agriculture, stock-breeding, fishing and gathering were the main productive activities, a trade sector always existed in Central Africa, playing a more or less important role according to historical circumstances. Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.
The rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.
These new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy.
* **Protecting new trade**: The coast had always exported palm oil, but in minute quantities. Imports into Britain rose from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21 000 tonnes in 1844, levelled off for ten years or so, and then doubled by 1870. France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade.
* **Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels**: The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.
While Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend. Silks and carpets from Turkey and Tripoli, natron from Borno, and Hausa textiles, were exchanged for kola nuts, gold, cotton materials from Dagomba, Mossi and Mande, shea butter and livestock from the Sudanese Sahel.
* **Marketing**: The role of the European commercial firms has been assessed by many scholars, most of whom agree on the significance of connecting Africa with markets in Western Europe and the Americas. The firm bought produce in and exported it from Africa. They also imported and sold a variety of manufactured goods, mostly textiles. McPhee, Bauer and Hopkins have rightly emphasized the firms' role in expanding the traders' frontier and the cash sector as a whole, but they say very little about the exploitative tendencies of these firms.$^{76}$ Traders - Europeans, Indians, Lebanese, and to a limited extent, Africans - appropriated the surplus generated by peasant production, especially through unequal exchange. They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.
A further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position.
* **From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns**: The great transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world did not occur with the late nineteenth-century partition by European powers. Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.
There had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2
The modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field**: Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies. On the contrary, as has been shown in some of the earlier chapters, by 1935, the production of only single or at best two cash crops had become the rule - cocoa in the Gold Coast, groundnuts in Senegal and The Gambia, cotton in Sudan, coffee and cotton in Uganda, coffee and sisal in Tanganyika, etc. The period after the Second World War did not see any improvement in this area hence most African states, on the attainment of independence, found them› selves saddled with monocrop economies and were therefore highly sensitive to the prevailing international trade conditions. Colonialism did indeed complete the integration of African economies into the world international economic order but in a very disadvantageous and exploitative manner and this has not been altered ever since.
* **Increased European interest**: The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.
A third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.
* **The West African pattern**: who went into the interior and shipped them overseas, and vice-versa. 23 New export-oriented production necessarily implied new imports. The import of various European manufactures, particularly from Great Britain, multiplied throughout the nineteenth century. For example, cotton-goods imports, already the leading import in the eighteenth century, went up fifty times between 1815 and 1850, and seven times more by 1891.$^{24}$ West African manufacturers adjusted to this massive inflow as had other peoples of other regions being incorporated into the world-economy. In part the local manufactures were displaced; in part they resisted the competition by design specialization and retreated into production for more limited markets. 25
* **Desert trade and the nomads**: A major mechanism ofcloser contact with the world economy was transSaharan trade, which for centuries had involved Saharan merchants, guides, transporters, and suppliers of commodities as diverse as food, goat skins to serve as water containers, and exports such as ostrich feathers for the European market. In the first place the people of the northern oases such as Tafilâlet, Mzab, Ghadâmes, the Fezzân, AwdjUa, and Sïwa played a pivotal role in organizing and financing trade. Perhaps because of the strategic location of these oases and because the oases relied heavily on the trade of dates for grain from zones of rainfall agriculture farther north, oasis dwellers, with their long histories of trade, moved naturally into transSaharan commerce over the centuries as opportunities opened up. Nomadic groups such as the Ahaggar and Kel-Ewey Tuareg, the Tubu, and the Zuwaya of the central Sahara (a Beduin group not to be confused with zawiya clerical lineages in Mauritania) traded small quantities of slaves and other products on their own account, but they could not match the scale of sedentary merchants from the northern oases, who had financial backing from middlemen in Mediterranean ports and ultimately from Europe, especially when prices and conditions on the routes were favour¬ able. Consequently the main role of camel nomads was to provide transport animals, guides, and military escorts for caravans, and they also ran freight delivery services for merchants who were unable to or preferred not to accompany caravans.21 Most groups of Saharan nomads had a major stake in the trade that passed through their territory: Regibat on the route to western Morocco; Ait Khabbash (a segment of the Ait Atta) on the Tafilälet-Tüwät road; Chaamba on the routes north of Tüwat; Tuareg on the Tripoli-Kano route; Tubu on the Borno-Fezzän road; Mujabra and Zuwaya for traffic between Benghazi and Wadai; KabäbTsh on the Darb al-Arbaln (forty-day road) between Därfür and the lower Nile.
* **The trans-Saharan trade**: The trans-Saharan trade was still flourishing at the beginning of the nineteenth century, both in the west (from Timbuktu to Tafilälet and from Goulimime to Taodeni) and in the centre (from Tunis and Tripoli to Ghadämes), and Sudanese exports still consisted ofslaves and gold. Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards. In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850. In 1895 trade by way of the TripoliBorno route suffered from the operations conducted by Rabeh, and the disruptions caused mainly by the French conquests in West Africa had their repercussions. But trade went into an irreversible decline in 1903 when caravans became
* **The growth of European interest**: Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.
This flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.
It was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.
All these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.
* **From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns**: The traditional compartmentalization between largely non-com› mercialized agricultural production and the long-distance trade in nonagricultural (luxury) products remained the rule even in those cases where there were small European agricultural settler communities, such as the prazeros in the Zambezi valley or the Boers on the Cape coast.
The one zone in which the economic situation was somewhat different was those parts of West and Central Africa where communities had begun to participate in the slave trade. The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.
Should this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650. The numbers by 1750 were about triple those of 1650. 4
* **From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns**: It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift. The Angolan coast was involved in a major way as of the sixteenth century, the Bight of Benin only as off. 1650, the Gold Coast as of c. 1700, the Bight of Biafra as off. 1740. The Sierra Leone coast, involved early, was a significant exporter only as of the middle of the eighteenth century. South-east Africa became a major source only in the nineteenth century. procedures for obtaining their quarry. At some point, therefore, production and political systems in West and Central Africa began to be adjusted as a function of these now continuing economic ties. When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'.
* **African reactions**: placement of 1000 000 metric tonnes. Goods to the value of roughly sixty million piastres or dollars were bartered for a total of 1 900000 Africans actually put on board at the export points. Of these, most probably 80 per cent were loaded south of the Equator.$^{29}$ Between the beginning of the century and the 1880s, the trans-Saharan trade and the Arab trade exported i 200 ooo and 800 ooo$^{30}$ black Africans respectively, individuals who had been captured in the vast belt stretching from the Bambara country in the west to southern Mozambique.

* **OPOBO**: 

Very little is known as to the source of the river. It is believed to branch off from the Niger, but the natives are so jealous of Europeans proceeding any distance into the interior, that it has never been explored, and nothing is really known of it beyond a few miles from its mouth. It is a good wide river where it falls into the sea, so that probably, if it is a branch of the Niger, it receives in its way to join the sea some streams. The repugnance the natives entertain to white men exploring their country does not issue from any dislike to the white men as such, but to a belief that if once the country is explored, the white men will flock to the interior, get at the markets, and so put an end to the trade of the middlemen, who at present purchase the oil up-country and bring it to the coast, making a handsome profit out of the transaction. There are about eight trading houses here, all of them English, and trade appears to be very brisk. Palm oil and kernels are, of course, the chief exports. The houses of the traders are situated together close to the mouth of the river, and they are picturesque in the extreme, constructed, of course, of wood, with roofs of corrugated iron, each house having a pier, godowns, and store-rooms in close proximity, so that the whole looks exactly like a miniature colony. Most of the traders have constructed tiny gardens in front of their residences, wherein they grow some of the choicest of the tropical plants intermingled with English roses, which form an attractive oasis in the dense masses of jungle and mangrove swamps with which each bank of the river is overgrown. The native town, at which the king resides, is distant some four miles up the river, and covers a considerable amount of space. Ja Ja has gone in heavily for the "resources of civilization." He has had a large banqueting hall built, decorated and furnished in the most tawdry fashion: here a huge banquet is spread every day for such of the chiefs and their retainers as may care to partake of it, and here also the king entertains any white men who may visit his capital, and who are invited in due course to partake of "chop," the native designation for a meal of any kind. To a person of English tastes, the viands, though plentiful in quantity, are not inviting: mysterious and unwholesome-looking dishes of native manufacture, enormous dishes of fish and goat stored in filthy-looking grease, and flavoured with the inevitable palm wine, do not have an invigorating effect on the stomach. Palm oil wine, a somewhat insipid beverage, with a taste in some measure approximating to home-made ginger beer, appears to be the chief native drink. The king does not, however, stint his guests to the wine of the country. Every description of European liquor is at their disposal. Ja Ja himself does not drink intoxicating fluids. "They make man fool" is his laconic description of their effect; and as the king is neither a fool nor has he any wish to become one, he is probably right to abstain from them. The house is neither particularly clean nor particularly dirty. Both the king and the principal chiefs have European built houses, and live more or less in European style. Ja Ja is a despotic monarch, and rules his people with a rod of iron, after a somewhat rough-and-ready fashion. A short time since he was disturbed in his slumbers one afternoon by a noisy disturbance which was taking place in close proximity to the royal palace between the retainers of two of his chiefs. The king got up, took down a Winchester repeating rifle, and shot dead with his own hands two of the obstreperous party, pour encourager les autres. There is no standing army, but nearly all the able-bodied men are trained to arms, and the king has three Gatling guns and some Armstrong field pieces, of which he is exceedingly proud. He is frequently engaged in war with neighbouring kings, and, as a rule, comes off the victor on these occasions. The prisoners taken in battle are killed and eaten. This is the only occasion upon which human flesh is indulged in. This, however, is not a custom incidental to Ja Ja alone, but appears to be the recognized method of warfare among the kings in this part of the world. The most powerful personage in the kingdom after the king is his "prime minister," a negress rejoicing in the name of Emma Johnson, who, born a Kentucky slave, afterwards migrated to Liberia, and eventually, after a somewhat chequered career, arrived at Ja Ja's kingdom, where, being a shrewd woman, nimble at her pen, she has acquired an extraordinary amount of power, and has more influence over the king than any one else. [In our last number we directed our readers' attention to some of the vagaries of this lady.] The greater portion of the income of both kings and chiefs is derived from the sale of palm oil, which they obtain up-country and dispose of to the English traders. Besides this, Ja Ja receives a duty of one per cent. on all oil exported from the river, and some other duties besides; so that his income is computed to be not less than £10,000 a year, a prodigious sum for a petty African king. Ja Ja has 200 wives. His eldest son and heir to the throne is being educated at a school in Liverpool, where he has been for a considerable time past, so that when he succeeds his father he will utilize his English education for the advancement of his country, and not as some other of those young native princes who were educated at home, and who have become more barbarous, blood-thirsty, and cruel to Europeans when they return to their native country, and throw over the burdensome restraints of civilization. Now that Ja Ja's country has been placed under English protection, it is to be hoped some of the cruelties and atrocities which, it is much to be feared, are not of infrequent occurrence, will be put a stop to. Ja Ja is a shrewd monarch, and as he is all-powerful and has no rivals, it only requires a little judicious pressure to induce him to govern his kingdom on somewhat less rough-and-ready principles than is now the case. The king has been of late endeavouring to ship palm oil to England on his own account, by which he can get about double the price he does out here. Up to the present, however, the traders have been too much for him in this respect, and the steamship companies, induced by them, will not take it on freight. The king, however, is not likely to be long baulked in his project: he can always bring a little gentle pressure to bear on the traders by stopping the oil supply. On the whole, Ja Ja himself, his capital, and his country, are interesting in the extreme. There is capital shooting here—elephants, crocodiles, hippopotami, and leopards, within easy reach too, so that a lover of sport finds his hands full.—*Times of India.*

## European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources to fuel their industrial demands, treating these resources as mere commodities for Western markets.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources to fuel their industrial demands, treating these resources as mere commodities for Western markets. The textbook offers substantial evidence by highlighting how mineral resources were exploited with foreign capital, often excluding Africans from benefiting, and how legislative measures were introduced to grant monopolies to imperialist interests. It discusses the neglect of industrialization in Africa, transforming African states into markets for European manufactured goods while focusing on the production of raw materials for export. The colonial economy's emphasis on cash crops led to the neglect of the internal sector, forcing Africans to produce for export rather than for their own consumption. Additionally, European commercial firms expanded the cash sector and appropriated surplus generated by peasant production through unequal exchange, illustrating the exploitative nature of colonial economic policies that prioritized European industrial demands over African development. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific examples of the extraction and transportation of African resources, such as palm oil and gold-dust, to Europe, as evidenced by the arrival of the Royal mail steamer Ethiop at Liverpool. The detailed market reports from Liverpool and London further illustrate how these resources were treated as commodities in Western markets, with specific prices and trading activities mentioned. The articles also list other African resources like palm kernels, linseed, and gum, indicating a systematic approach to utilizing African natural wealth for European industrial and commercial purposes. However, the articles notably omit the colonial context and the impact on African societies, focusing instead on economic transactions and market dynamics. Together, these sources reinforce the claim by providing historical context, examples of exploitation, and economic manipulation by colonial powers, while also highlighting the absence of explicit discussion on the exploitative nature of colonialism in the news articles.

* **Ownership of the means of production > Minerals**: With the exception of a few cases, mineral resources were exploited with foreign capital. Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933." It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.
The export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast. By 1914 all countries had experienced a decade of appreciable growth.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field**: Finally, whatever economic growth was achieved during the colonial period was done at a phenomenal and unjustifiable cost to the African - what with forced labour, migrant labour (which, says Davidson, 'probably did more to dismantle pre-colonial cultures and economies than most other aspects of the colonial experience put together'),$^{30}$ compulsory cultivation of certain crops, compulsory seizure of land, forced movements of popu› lations with the consequential dislocation of family life, the pass system, the high mortality rate in the mines and on the plantations, the brutality with which African resistance and protest movements generated by these measures were suppressed, etc. Above all, the monetary policies pursued by the colonial powers towards their colonies - tying their currencies to those of the colonial powers, introducing tariffs and keeping all foreign exchange earnings in the metropolitan capitals - while ensuring stable and fully convertible currencies, led to the freezing of colonial assets in the metropolitan capitals instead of their being realized and invested in the colonies. The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.
From the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field**: As an eminent economist has pointed out, 'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically. Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, 'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.
Fourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa's pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945," Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa. African technological development was thereby halted and was never resumed until after independence.
* **Marketing**: The role of the European commercial firms has been assessed by many scholars, most of whom agree on the significance of connecting Africa with markets in Western Europe and the Americas. The firm bought produce in and exported it from Africa. They also imported and sold a variety of manufactured goods, mostly textiles. McPhee, Bauer and Hopkins have rightly emphasized the firms' role in expanding the traders' frontier and the cash sector as a whole, but they say very little about the exploitative tendencies of these firms.$^{76}$ Traders - Europeans, Indians, Lebanese, and to a limited extent, Africans - appropriated the surplus generated by peasant production, especially through unequal exchange. They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.
A further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field**: Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies. On the contrary, as has been shown in some of the earlier chapters, by 1935, the production of only single or at best two cash crops had become the rule - cocoa in the Gold Coast, groundnuts in Senegal and The Gambia, cotton in Sudan, coffee and cotton in Uganda, coffee and sisal in Tanganyika, etc. The period after the Second World War did not see any improvement in this area hence most African states, on the attainment of independence, found them› selves saddled with monocrop economies and were therefore highly sensitive to the prevailing international trade conditions. Colonialism did indeed complete the integration of African economies into the world international economic order but in a very disadvantageous and exploitative manner and this has not been altered ever since.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field**: coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C. Coquery-Vidrovitch has pointed out above (Chapter 15). Thus, under the colonial system, Africans were in most cases made to produce what they did not consume and to consume what they did not produce, clear evidence of the lopsided and exploitive nature of the colonial economy. In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau.
* **Purposes and impositions of colonialism**: The introduction of money taxes was briefly accompanied by labour taxes, the most obvious expression of European attempts to enlist labour forcibly into the economic organization of the colonial effort. The impôt de cueillette, the tax by which wild rubber was harvested in the Congo Free State, was the most criticized of such taxes, but in duration the French prestation, a labour tax required of all males in French West and Equatorial Africa unless remitted by cash payment, was the longest; it was only abolished in 1944. Conversely, the Germans in the Cameroon allowed the capitation tax to be remitted by a labour 'payment'. And in parts of Uganda, the British continued the luwalo, a pre-colonial public-work tax of one month's labour, until 1938, when it was replaced by a money tax. Yet such taxes were the exception to forced labour devices employed by all of the colonial powers.
Consistently concerned with shortages of manpower for new projects and new employments which colonial rule supported, European administrators imposed their domination before the end of the century by a system of virtual impressment, frequently satisfying private as well as public purposes. It is true that such direct forced labour declined in the early twentieth century, because of the decreasing need for portage as well as the increasing concern with international opinion. But the uses, however modified, remained an integral part of colonial domination until the Second World War. At least this was the case with the French colonial governments which, as in West Africa still employed large numbers of Africans through prestation particularly on railway building until after the Second World War. Moreover, French colonial officials frequently sanctioned labour recruitment for commercial purposes, as on rubber plantations of Equatorial Africa or in the forests of the Ivory Coast.$^{28}$ Abuses at this time were still sufficient in intensity to arouse expressions of public indignation, most well marked in the celebrated commentary of AndrØ Gide in his Voyage au Congo (1927).
* **Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\ 1910**: From the late fifteenth century onwards, Africa participated in the Europeoriented world economy as a peripheral and dependent sector. But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.
Africans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.
Coastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland. Therefore, distance from the coast was one of the determinants of how early the colonial economy could be set in motion.
* **The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field**: The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C. Coquery-Vidrovitch has pointed out above (Chapter
* **Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\ 1910**: The most decisive variable affecting the implanting of the colonial economy was the extent to which various parts of Africa had already been participating in the world economy. This was partly because Europeans preferred jurisdiction over areas with which they were already familiar, and partly because pre-colonial foreign trade orientation caused African communities to be more susceptible to colonial economic innovations, such as the cultivation of crops specifically for sale to Europeans. The slaving zones from Senegal to Sierra Leone, from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Nigeria and from the Congo river to Angola were the stretches of coast› line first encroached upon by the European colonizers. In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves. Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland. Indeed, they overestimated the amount of wealth which could be readily made if they penetrated to these sources. This accounts for the commercial attention paid to the countryside above the Niger/Benue confluence during the 1880s and 1890s.
* **Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops**: The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals. With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers. The family was the basic unit of production. It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.
Participation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock. First, it did not involve any fundamental technological innovation. Second, many of these crops or similar ones had been grown and processed long before the colonial era.
* **Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?**: European powers were able to conquer Africa with such relative ease because in virtually every respect the dice was so heavily loaded in their favour. In the first place, thanks to the activities of European explorers and missionaries, Europeans were by 1880 far more knowledgeable about Africa and its interior - its physical appearance, terrain, economy and other resources and the strength and weakness of its states and societies - than Africans were about Europe.
Secondly, owing to the revolutionary changes in medical technology and in particular the discovery of the prophylactic use of quinine against malaria, Europeans became far less fearful of Africa than they had been before the middle of the nineteenth century. 57 Thirdly, as a result of the uneven nature of the trade between Europe and Africa up to the 1870s, and even after, as well as the increasing pace of the industrial revolution, the material and financial resources available to Europe were overwhelming in comparison with those of Africa. Thus while . European powers could afford to spend millions of pounds on overseas campaigns, African states were unable to sustain any protracted military confrontation against them.
* **African participation in the colonial economy, 1920-30**: Wherever there was a clash between peasant farming and hired labour, the African choice was almost invariably in favour of his own cultivation. Virtually all agricultural staples produced by peasants in Africa were associated with plantations elsewhere - notably, coffee in Latin America and palm oil in the East Indies. The strength of the African communities was responsible for the widespread incidence of peasant farms. Central Africa, with its low population density, was the arena for concession companies, infamous for forced labour. Such settled agriculture as was developed in Central Africa, continued with coercion over a rural proletariat, as on the sugar, sisal and cotton plantations of Mozambique and Angola, or it became capital-intensive, as in the Belgian Congo. It was possible for Lever Brothers to set up oil palm plantations in the Belgian Congo from 1911. Their requests to have similar concessions in British West Africa were turned down, because the colonial administration correctly perceived that such a venture would necessitate the violent subjugation of thousands of inhabitants. Besides, the colonialists had early proof in West Africa of the success and viability of the African peasantry in producing an exportable surplus and lucrative returns to the European trading community. French persistence with settler agriculture in West Africa demonstrated its inferiority vis-à-vis African small-scale production. In East Africa, Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia, the settler economy had to be subsidized and protected from African competition by legislation, without which it could not have secured enough labour. Where mining was merely a localized intrusion into an agricultural colonial economy, African choice was once more in favour of peasant production, giving rise, for example, to difficulties in the recruitment of local mine labour in Asante and the Western Province of the Gold Coast and Sukumaland (Tan› ganyika).
* **'Native policy'**: Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.
This realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.
In contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2
* **Ownership of the means of production**: rulers. This Society did this by appealing to the Privy Council in London which ruled that land was the 'undisputed right of the community'. " Asa result of these victories by the West Africans, the British abandoned the policy of direct control of land though in theory all lands in the conquered areas of British West Africa such as Benin in Nigeria and Asante in the Gold Coast or lands ceded to the British Crown such as Lagos were owned by the Crown while lands in the protectorates such as Northern Nigeria or the Northern Terri› tories of the Gold Coast were held in trust by the Crown for the people. 1 9 However, rigorous campaigns were mounted by Europeans like W. H. Lever, the Liverpool soap and margarine tycoon, and societies such as the British Cotton Growing Association between 1906 and 1925 for the estab› lishment of plantations in British West Africa, and indeed a few plantations were established in the Gold Coast, Southern Nigeria and Sierra Leone. These campaigns, however, failed and by 1930 only a relatively small proportion of land in British West Africa had been alienated for the use of the colonial rulers and other Europeans and most of this was for mining purposes.
* **Marketing**: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk. They sold their imported goods in the original packages; they dealt only in large quantities, and left the retail business entirely in the hands of the Sierra Leone traders ... All this is now changed. The middleman's occupation is no longer what it used to be, as the great firms of importers have gradually become their own middlemen, and, while continuing to be wholesale merchants, they have developed retail business on their own account. 75 Secondly, in most cases African businessmen could not secure bank loans because they had no collateral. Furthermore, at times racial prejudice was also employed in this respect.
* **The changing balance of power**: Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.
Perhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882.
* **Ownership of the means of production**: It was neither a deliberate policy on the part of British colonial rulers which saved the land in British West Africa for the Africans during the inter-war period, nor was it because of the notorious reputation that West Africa had acquired as 'the White Man's Grave' by the late nineteenth century. As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa.
* **From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns**: It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift. The Angolan coast was involved in a major way as of the sixteenth century, the Bight of Benin only as off. 1650, the Gold Coast as of c. 1700, the Bight of Biafra as off. 1740. The Sierra Leone coast, involved early, was a significant exporter only as of the middle of the eighteenth century. South-east Africa became a major source only in the nineteenth century. procedures for obtaining their quarry. At some point, therefore, production and political systems in West and Central Africa began to be adjusted as a function of these now continuing economic ties. When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'.
* **The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > National prestige**: The greatest exponent of this theory is Carlton Hayes. In a perceptive passage he contends: France sought compensation for European loss in overseas gain. England would offset her European isolation by enlarging and glorify› ing the British empire. Russia, halted in the Balkans, would turn anew to Asia, and Germany and Italy would show the world that the prestige they had won by might inside Europe they were entitled to enhance by imperial exploits outside. The lesser powers, with no great prestige at stake, managed to get on without any new imperialism, though Portugal and Holland displayed a revived pride in the empires they already possessed and the latter's was administered with renewed vigor. 1S Hayes concludes therefore that 'the new imperialism' was basically 'a nationalistic phenomenon' and that its proponents hankered after national prestige. European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'. Thus, he concludes, the partition of Africa was not an economic phenomenon. 1 6

We have heard of the tallow tree, but whoever heard of a tree producing soap or gelatine? And yet they are now realities with me.

**Sugar.**—Market for cane generally quiet, and, to effect sales from the quay, a concession of 3d. to 6d. has been made, except for grainy kinds, which are steady; at the close an improved tone is observable. Beet has also been dull, with a drooping tendency; a rather steadier feeling, however, is apparent at the close; prompt 16s. 1½d.
