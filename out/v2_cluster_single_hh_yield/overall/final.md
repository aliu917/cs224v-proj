# The passage argues that Africa, having been long-neglected, requires external intervention for industrial and moral regeneration to address its challenges and advance the triumph of good over evil.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that Africa requires external intervention for industrial and moral regeneration. The "General History of Africa" offers a nuanced view, highlighting Africa's historical interactions with external forces, particularly during the colonial period. It acknowledges the internal efforts of African leaders in the nineteenth century to reform their societies, often undermined by European intervention. While the text discusses the role of missionaries and colonial powers in shaping Africa's political and social landscape, sometimes justifying intervention for security and economic opportunities, it also emphasizes the negative impact of colonialism as a subversion of African self-development. Additionally, it notes the influence of Afro-American interactions and pan-African movements, suggesting Africa was engaged in dynamic exchanges with the diaspora, thus not entirely neglected. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim, emphasizing the need for Africa to be "roused to industrial vigour and productive activity" and advocating for external intervention through the African-Aid Society and Christian civilization to combat the "torpor of barbarism." The articles suggest that "good must be forced upon her" through material benefits leading to moral change, aligning with the belief in the necessity of external efforts to address Africa's challenges and advance the triumph of good over evil. While the articles do not explicitly mention Africa as "long-neglected," they imply a need for significant change and development. Together, these sources provide a complex picture of Africa's historical and contemporary challenges, with the textbook offering a more balanced view of internal initiatives and external influences, while the articles advocate for external involvement in Africa's regeneration.

# The King of Dahomey perpetuated the practice of human sacrifices as a deeply entrenched cultural and religious ritual to assert power, maintain social and political control, and resist external pressures, despite concerns from missionaries and the local Christian community.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the King of Dahomey perpetuated human sacrifices as a deeply entrenched cultural and religious ritual to assert power, maintain social and political control, and resist external pressures. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim, focusing instead on Dahomey's resistance to British and French abolitionist demands to end the slave trade and its economic transition to palm oil under King Gezo. This suggests a broader reluctance to abandon traditional practices under external pressure, though it does not specifically address human sacrifices. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed support for the claim, describing the King's annual customs involving human sacrifices as a means to instill fear, assert dominance, and retaliate against English interference in the slave trade. The articles emphasize the King's resistance to external pressures, including those from missionaries and the British government, and highlight the religious aspect of appeasing evil spirits through sacrifices. Despite the efforts of missionaries like Mr. Bernasko and concerns from the local Christian community, the King maintained these rituals, viewing them as essential to his authority and social order. While the General History of Africa provides context on Dahomey's economic and cultural adaptations, The African Times aligns more closely with the claim by illustrating the cultural, religious, and political significance of human sacrifices in Dahomey, underscoring the challenges faced by those attempting to intervene.

# British intervention in Dahomey was justified by framing its cultural practices, such as human sacrifice, as barbaric and destabilizing, which allowed the British to rationalize their efforts to dismantle Dahomey's power and influence under the guise of moral and civilizing missions.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that British intervention in Dahomey was justified by framing its cultural practices, such as human sacrifice, as barbaric and destabilizing. The General History of Africa does not explicitly mention this justification, instead highlighting British tactics like "divide and conquer" and exploiting African rivalries to their advantage. It emphasizes British interests in abolishing the slave trade and establishing legitimate trade, leading to treaties and the erosion of local sovereignty. While Dahomey's involvement in the slave trade and its transition to palm oil trade under French influence are noted, the textbook does not specifically link British intervention to cultural practices like human sacrifice. In contrast, The African Times articles align more closely with the claim, detailing Dahomeyan customs involving human sacrifices and portraying the King of Dahomey as a ruler who delights in such practices. The articles emphasize British abhorrence of these customs and frame intervention as a moral and civilizing mission, suggesting that exposing Dahomeyan envoys to "advanced civilization" could be beneficial. However, they also mention a treaty allowing British subjects to reside and trade in Dahomey, indicating economic interests alongside moral justifications. The articles further highlight Dahomey's strategic importance in trade routes and regional stability, suggesting that British intervention was motivated by a combination of moral, economic, and geopolitical interests. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view that both supports and complicates the claim, revealing a complex interplay of motivations behind British actions in Dahomey.

# The British sought to neutralize the perceived threat of the Dahomey Kingdom to regional stability through diplomatic influence and military intervention, marking the beginning of European efforts to curb its aggressive actions.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that the British sought to neutralize the perceived threat of the Dahomey Kingdom through diplomatic influence and military intervention. The General History of Africa does not provide specific details supporting or refuting this claim, instead focusing on the broader context of Anglo-French rivalry and the strategic importance of trade and territorial control in the region. It highlights the French conquest of Dahomey in 1892 but does not attribute any specific British military or diplomatic efforts aimed at curbing Dahomey's aggressive actions, emphasizing instead the partition of territories and protectorate declarations. In contrast, The African Times articles offer several details supporting the claim, describing British diplomatic pressure through the imposition of a fine on the King of Dahomey for outrages against British and French subjects, and indicating a readiness for military intervention through the blockade of Dahoman ports and potential deployment of British troops, including the 1st West India Regiment and Houssas. The articles also mention the establishment of British protectorates and highlight the British naval presence and involvement of Commodore Sir William Hewett, underscoring the military aspect of British efforts. However, they do not explicitly state that these actions marked the beginning of European efforts to curb Dahomey's aggression, nor do they provide a comprehensive overview of European involvement beyond British actions. This lack of broader European context in the articles contrasts with the textbook's focus on Anglo-French rivalry, illustrating a notable difference in the portrayal of British and European strategies regarding Dahomey.

# The Dahomian king utilized annual ceremonies as a form of political theater to assert his authority, reinforce his legitimacy through his father's legacy, display power and wealth, and establish a centralized political structure with tributary obligations and a regulated system of taxation.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced understanding of the Dahomian king's use of annual ceremonies as a form of political theater. While the textbook does not explicitly mention the Dahomian king or the specific use of ceremonies, it discusses the broader context of African states, including Dahomey, emphasizing the need to centralize power, extract surpluses, and maintain a standing military force. This context aligns with the claim that the Dahomian king might have used ceremonies to assert authority and reinforce legitimacy. The textbook also highlights the importance of centralized political structures and tributary obligations, which could be analogous to a regulated system of taxation. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim, describing how the Dahomian king utilized annual ceremonies to assert his authority and reinforce his legitimacy through his father's legacy. The articles detail the commemoration of victory over the Ayors, with elaborate displays involving Amazons and singers, and symbolic acts like having twelve Ayor people carry silk damask and cotton shirting, signifying the end of tributary obligations. This supports the claim of using ceremonies to display power and wealth and suggests a regulated system of taxation through the collection of tribute and extortionate demands. However, the articles do not explicitly address the establishment of a centralized political structure, a notable difference from the claim. Together, these sources illustrate the king's use of ceremonies to assert authority and display power, while highlighting gaps in the discussion of centralized political structures.

# The Dahoman government's use of captured Ayors in ceremonial roles, alongside the symbolic use of silk damask to challenge cultural norms, reflects a complex legal and moral system that both revered and feared authority, while also reversing power dynamics and challenging the narrative of Dahomey as a violent society.

The examination of the claim regarding the Dahoman government's use of captured Ayors in ceremonial roles and the symbolic use of silk damask reveals a nuanced perspective when combining insights from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not provide specific information on the ceremonial roles of captured Ayors or the symbolic use of silk damask, focusing instead on Dahomey's transition from the slave trade to palm oil production and the use of war captives as labor. It also lacks details on the legal and moral systems in the context of reversing power dynamics or challenging narratives of violence. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed accounts that align with the claim, describing a ceremony where twelve Ayor individuals carried silk damask and cotton shirting, symbolizing a reversal of power dynamics and challenging cultural norms. This act was intended to assert Dahomey's authority and celebrate the victory and independence achieved by the Dahoman king's father over the Ayors. The articles also highlight Dahomey's complex legal and moral system, where authority was both revered and feared, as evidenced by the ceremonial use of captured individuals and symbolic gestures of power. However, they also depict Dahomey as a society with violent practices, such as human sacrifices during the "Royal custom," which contrasts with the claim's suggestion of a narrative challenging Dahomey as a violent society. This duality underscores the complexity of Dahomey's legal and moral system, where authority and power dynamics were intricately woven into cultural and ceremonial practices.

# The construction of royal monuments in Dahomey using human blood symbolized the intertwining of ritualistic violence, political power, and the subjugation of enemies, reflecting broader practices of using ancestral trophies in political and spiritual negotiations in African societies.

The claim that the construction of royal monuments in Dahomey using human blood symbolized the intertwining of ritualistic violence, political power, and the subjugation of enemies is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences in focus. The General History of Africa does not specifically address the use of human blood in Dahomey's royal monuments, nor does it explicitly discuss the intertwining of ritualistic violence and political power in this context. However, it does explore themes of ritual power, political authority, and the use of violence in various African societies, highlighting the role of religious symbols and rituals in legitimizing rulers and defending sovereignty, as well as the integration of religious and political authority. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed accounts supporting the claim, describing the practice of constructing a "Beadshouse" over the graves of deceased kings in Dahomey, where the mud for the walls is mixed with human blood, often from enemies. This practice symbolizes the intertwining of ritualistic violence and political power, reflecting the subjugation of enemies and the use of their blood in these monuments. The articles emphasize the political significance of these rituals, linking them to the king's military successes and the broader practice of using ancestral trophies in political and spiritual negotiations. While the articles do not explicitly mention ancestral trophies in political negotiations, they provide substantial evidence supporting the claim, with minor differences in the specific details compared to the broader themes discussed in the textbook.

# In African societies, the use of elaborate monuments, symbolic artifacts, and ceremonial customs underscores the cultural and political significance of honoring ancestors, demonstrating authority, and maintaining diplomatic relations.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the cultural and political significance of honoring ancestors, demonstrating authority, and maintaining diplomatic relations in African societies through the use of symbolic artifacts and ceremonial customs. The textbook highlights the role of ritual and mystical power in Central African societies, where insignia and charms were used for protection and authority, and emphasizes the belief in a community of the dead alongside the living, underscoring the importance of ancestors in societal structures. It also discusses the cultural significance of symbolic artifacts like charms, amulets, and talismans, and the role of religion in binding societies together, which can be seen as a form of maintaining diplomatic relations. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of elaborate monuments. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details on the construction of elaborate monuments, such as the "Beadshouse" in Dahomey, built over the graves of deceased kings and involving symbolic artifacts like gold and silver tools, beads, and human blood, highlighting the importance of honoring ancestors and displaying authority through grand customs. The articles also describe the use of symbolic staffs in diplomatic missions and ceremonial customs like the "Royal custom" involving sacrifices, further emphasizing the cultural significance of these practices. They also mention the denial of human sacrifices by Dahomeyan envoys, suggesting a complexity in the portrayal of these customs. Together, these sources illustrate how African societies use monuments, artifacts, and customs to honor ancestors, assert authority, and engage in diplomacy, while also highlighting differences in the emphasis on monuments.

# Tensions and potential conflicts between colonial powers and local African communities were exacerbated by aggressive and disrespectful actions from British forces, reflecting broader resistance to colonial interference in governance and trade.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that tensions and potential conflicts between colonial powers and local African communities were exacerbated by aggressive and disrespectful actions from British forces. The textbook highlights instances such as the British interference in local governance, exemplified by the imposition of unqualified chiefs during the Asante uprising of 1900, and the demand for the sacred Golden Stool by the British governor, which was a profound symbol of Asante identity. The use of violence and mercenaries, as seen in the resistance by the Nandi in Kenya, and the tactic of "divide and conquer" further illustrate the aggressive actions that fueled resistance. Additionally, the imposition of taxes, forced labor, and the undermining of local trade monopolies, like those held by the Mazrui family, demonstrate broader resistance to colonial interference in trade. Similarly, The African Times articles describe aggressive colonial interference, such as Captain Glover's rumored plan to attack Eppe by bribing local chiefs, and Captain Ness's arrest of local leaders in Ningo, reflecting forceful imposition of authority. The violent confrontation in Quittah, where British forces killed several natives, and the failed military expedition against King Karimoo, further underscore the violent and disrespectful actions of British forces, contributing to local resistance. Together, these examples from both sources illustrate the aggressive and disrespectful actions of British forces that intensified conflicts with African communities, aligning with the claim of exacerbated tensions and broader resistance to colonial interference in governance and trade.

# The Ashantees, through strategic alliances with local groups like the Awoonlahs, Aquamboes, and others, played a central role in exacerbating regional conflicts and disrupting the political stability of the Eastern Districts for several years.

The claim that the Ashantees, through strategic alliances with local groups like the Awoonlahs and Aquamboes, played a central role in exacerbating regional conflicts and disrupting the political stability of the Eastern Districts is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not mention specific alliances between the Ashantees and these local groups, nor does it directly address their role in regional conflicts or political instability in the Eastern Districts. Instead, it focuses on the Ashantee's political and military strategies, their dominance over other Akan states, and their economic interactions with non-Akan regions and European powers, without providing specific details about the mentioned alliances or their impact. This absence of information suggests that the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim directly, which could be significant for historians comparing the claim to the textbook's content. In contrast, The African Times articles provide several details supporting the claim, noting that the Ashantees aided the Aquamoos and Awconlahs in war efforts, including plundering plantations and attacking trading parties. The articles report the Ashantees' active participation in conflicts, such as bringing forces against the trans-Volta Crepee and their involvement in incidents like the capture of a missionary and the detention of Mr. Simpson. These details align with the claim of the Ashantees' alliances contributing to regional instability, though the articles lack a comprehensive overview of the Ashantees' motivations or the broader geopolitical context, which could offer a more nuanced understanding of their role.

# During the late 19th century, the geopolitical tensions and territorial disputes in Africa, exemplified by the actions of the King of Dahomey and the contested status of regions like Whydah, underscore the competitive nature of European colonial powers, such as Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, as they sought to expand their influence and control over strategic areas, often at the expense of African kingdoms.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the competitive nature of European colonial powers in Africa during the late 19th century, as they sought to expand their influence and control over strategic areas, often at the expense of African kingdoms. The textbook highlights the Anglo-French rivalry over territories like Porto Novo and western Yorubaland, driven by both local dynamics and European geopolitical interests, exemplified by the French conquest of Dahomey in 1892 and the partition of Borgu between Britain and France in 1895. While the textbook primarily focuses on Britain, France, and Germany, with Portugal's activities noted in a different context, it does not specifically mention the King of Dahomey or the contested status of Whydah, nor does it address Spain's involvement. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details on the King of Dahomey's interactions with European nations, including alliances with France, Spain, and Portugal against England, illustrating the complex dynamics and alliances of the period. The contested status of regions like Whydah is highlighted through reports of Portuguese annexation and British blockades, emphasizing their strategic importance. The articles also mention European involvement in local conflicts and trade disputes, such as the blockade of Dahomey and the seizure of goods at Porto Novo. However, they do not explicitly mention Spain's involvement in these specific events. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the competitive colonial landscape in Africa during this era, despite some differences in the specific details and focus of each source.

# Some Africans believed that the British monarchy was unaware of the injustices and unjust treatment carried out by its colonial representatives, who were influenced by local intrigues.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the claim that some Africans believed the British monarchy was unaware of the injustices and unjust treatment carried out by its colonial representatives, who were influenced by local intrigues. The General History of Africa does not explicitly address this belief, focusing instead on the colonial administration's paternalistic and authoritarian nature, the manipulation of traditional leadership, and the imposition of European bureaucratic structures. It highlights the resistance of African leaders to colonial rule and the discontent among both traditional and educated elites, but it does not provide evidence of a belief among Africans that the British monarchy was ignorant of the injustices perpetrated by its representatives. In contrast, The African Times news articles support the claim by suggesting that some Africans believed the British monarchy and government might not be aware of the actions of their consul or war officers. The articles express confidence that the Queen does not wish to exercise power wrongfully and suggest that the conduct of agents, such as Colonel Conran, might be contrary to her instructions, indicating a perceived disconnect between the monarchy's intentions and the actions of its colonial agents. Additionally, the articles highlight the negative impact of local intrigues and the unjust treatment of African dignitaries under British protection, implying a lack of oversight or awareness by the British authorities. Together, these sources illustrate a complex narrative where the belief in the monarchy's unawareness is more explicitly documented in contemporary news articles than in historical texts.

# The British colonial strategy in Africa relied heavily on military force and local intermediaries to suppress resistance, protect territorial interests, and maintain control, as evidenced by coordinated military efforts against uprisings and the use of emigrants to establish covert military presence.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the British colonial strategy in Africa, which heavily relied on military force and local intermediaries to suppress resistance, protect territorial interests, and maintain control. The General History of Africa highlights Britain's use of military imperialism, exemplified by the punitive expedition against Benin in 1897 and the conquest of Nigeria, including the annexation of Asante and the Sokoto sultanate. This strategy involved a combination of diplomacy and military confrontation, with varied Nigerian reactions ranging from open military confrontation to alliances and submission. The British effectively employed a divide-and-rule approach, exploiting African rivalries and utilizing African levies in military campaigns, as seen in the conquest of the Zambezi valley and the occupation of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. Similarly, The African Times articles describe coordinated military efforts against groups like the Angoni Zulus, led by British officers and involving local troops such as the Sikhs and Atonga, underscoring the reliance on military force. The campaign against Nupé further illustrates the use of military action to enforce treaties and suppress slave raiding. Additionally, the strategic placement of local leaders, like Masambah Kokie, to manage local affairs, indicates the use of intermediaries. However, both sources do not support the claim regarding the use of emigrants to establish a covert military presence, as neither the textbook nor the articles mention such a tactic. This absence highlights a notable difference, suggesting that while military force and local intermediaries were integral to the British strategy, the specific use of emigrants for covert military purposes lacks evidence in these accounts.

# The rise in human sacrifices under the new King of Dahomey suggests a shift in the political or religious climate, potentially influenced by groups using spiritualism to manipulate the King and maintain traditional practices, with local leaders possibly complicit in these harmful customs.

The claim regarding a rise in human sacrifices under the new King of Dahomey, suggesting a shift in the political or religious climate potentially influenced by spiritualist manipulation, is addressed differently by the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not directly support the claim, as it focuses on Dahomey's economic transition from the slave trade to palm oil production due to external trading pressures, particularly from a French firm. This indicates an adaptation to changing economic conditions rather than a focus on spiritual or religious practices, with no mention of human sacrifices or spiritual manipulation. In contrast, The African Times articles report an increase in human sacrifices during the Sorsi custom under the new King, who executed ninety men compared to the previous King's limit of thirty, suggesting a more extreme approach. However, the articles do not provide evidence of spiritualism or manipulation by groups in Dahomey, nor do they indicate local leaders' complicity in these customs. The mention of spiritualism and manipulation is instead associated with Madagascar, where the King is influenced by superstitious beliefs. Thus, while the articles support the claim of increased sacrifices, they do not corroborate the suggested spiritual manipulation or complicity in Dahomey, highlighting a divergence between the claim and the sources.

# The Kingdom of Dahomey uniquely integrated female warriors, known as Amazons, into its military and cultural life, challenging traditional gender roles and European military norms by relying on their bravery and strategic significance in both combat and ceremonial roles.

The Kingdom of Dahomey uniquely integrated female warriors, known as Amazons, into its military and cultural life, challenging traditional gender roles and European military norms. The General History of Africa textbook supports this claim by detailing the Amazons' role as a feared component of Dahomey's permanent army, highlighting their involvement in compulsory military service during wartime. This underscores their strategic significance in combat, although the text does not delve into their ceremonial roles or their impact on European perceptions. Complementing this, The African Times news articles emphasize the Amazons' formidable presence in the military, noting their indomitable courage, strategic importance, and ferocity, often surpassing that of their male counterparts. The articles also highlight their cultural significance through participation in ceremonial customs, such as carrying prisoners and engaging in the King's customs. While both sources affirm the Amazons' challenge to traditional gender roles, they do not explicitly address the broader impact on European military norms, focusing instead on their roles within Dahomey. Together, these observations confirm the Amazons' integral role in both combat and cultural life, though they leave some aspects of their influence on European perceptions unexplored.

# The militaristic and brutal nature of Dahomey society, characterized by the capture and sacrifice of war prisoners, ritualistic violence, and severe human rights abuses, underscores the reliance on warfare and traditional practices for maintaining power and resources.

The observations from the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the militaristic and brutal nature of Dahomey society. The textbook does not explicitly address the claim regarding Dahomey's engagement in capturing and sacrificing war prisoners or ritualistic violence. Instead, it highlights Dahomey's economic transition from the slave trade to palm oil production, emphasizing the use of war captives as labor, which suggests an economic adaptation rather than a focus on ritualistic violence. The text also discusses broader regional changes, such as new social structures and governance emerging in response to warfare, without specifically attributing these to Dahomey. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim of Dahomey's militaristic and brutal nature, describing the capture and sacrifice of war prisoners, known as "poor Ayors," as part of customary rituals. The articles also mention the "Horses' Custom" and the execution of individuals during the Attor and Sorsi customs, illustrating ritualistic violence. The involvement of the Amazons, a female military regiment, underscores the militaristic aspect of Dahomey society. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the reliance on traditional practices for maintaining resources, focusing more on violent customs and the execution of war prisoners. While the articles provide a broader context of violence in West African societies, they do not specifically address Dahomey's reliance on warfare for resources, highlighting a divergence between the two sources in their portrayal of Dahomey society.

# The Kingdom of Dahomey utilized ritual killings and human sacrifices, justified by religious beliefs, as a means to demonstrate power, instill fear, and manage captives, while these practices also served as significant cultural events that engaged both local and European participants.

The Kingdom of Dahomey's use of ritual killings and human sacrifices is documented in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, each providing insights into different aspects of these practices. The General History of Africa highlights the cultural significance of human sacrifices, noting their role in annual customs and the economic motivations behind the capture of slaves for export and labor. However, it does not explicitly connect these practices to the demonstration of power, the instillation of fear, or the management of captives, nor does it mention European involvement. In contrast, The African Times articles provide vivid descriptions of "evil nights" where numerous men were killed, with their heads displayed as trophies, underscoring the ritualistic and religious justifications for these acts. The articles also emphasize the cultural importance of these events, such as massacres held in memory of deceased leaders, which involved local chiefs and European merchants, although the latter refused to attend. While the articles do not explicitly confirm European participation in the rituals, they do support the claim that these practices were used to demonstrate power, instill fear, and manage captives, serving as significant cultural events. Together, these sources offer a nuanced view of the Kingdom of Dahomey's ritual practices, highlighting both their cultural and religious dimensions.

# The Kingdom of Dahomey played a pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade, with its economy and the authority of its rulers heavily reliant on the trade, while the King justified its continuation by blaming foreign demand, suggesting that its abolition required addressing this demand and exploring alternative commerce, despite the significant economic and historical impact on the region.

The Kingdom of Dahomey played a pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade, with both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles providing insights that support this claim. The textbook highlights Dahomey's heavy economic reliance on the slave trade, noting that King Gezo continued to supply slaves to Portuguese dealers despite European abolitionist pressures. It describes Dahomey as a persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state, with its rulers' authority tied to the trade, and mentions a transition to palm oil trade as an alternative commerce. Although the textbook does not explicitly state that King Gezo justified the trade by blaming foreign demand, it implies awareness of demand from Brazil-based Portuguese dealers. The African Times articles further support the claim by emphasizing Dahomey's economic and political dependence on the slave trade, with Whydah as a principal port for slave exportation. They note that the King justified the trade's continuation by blaming foreign demand, particularly from Cuba, and suggested that abolition required addressing this demand. The articles also highlight the King's interest in alternative commerce, such as palm oil, while acknowledging the ongoing significance of the slave trade. Additionally, they discuss British efforts to suppress the trade and the diplomatic challenges involved. While the articles do not explicitly address the historical impact on the region, both sources collectively underscore Dahomey's crucial role in the slave trade and the complexities surrounding its abolition.

# The passage suggests that Christian England and other nations have a moral obligation to intervene and abolish the slave trade in East Africa, viewing it as essential for aligning with a vision of moral purity and advancing Christian civilization and industrial progress.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the claim that Christian England and other nations felt a moral obligation to intervene and abolish the slave trade in East Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the role of the humanitarian spirit and evangelical movement in advocating for abolition, driven by a vision of moral purity and the propagation of Christianity. It notes that abolitionists aimed to regenerate Africa through Christianity, civilization, and legitimate commerce, reflecting a moral and civilizational mission. Missionaries, often acting as agents of European colonialism, encouraged European intervention as a morally justified undertaking, particularly from the 1870s onwards. However, the textbook also points out that economic and industrial progress, stemming from the Industrial Revolution, played a significant role in changing attitudes towards the slave trade, as new productive capacities made slave labor less profitable, indicating that motivations were not solely moral or religious but also economic. In parallel, The African Times articles strongly support the claim by emphasizing the moral obligation of Great Britain to take decisive action against the slave trade, describing it as a "devastating and brutalizing curse" and a "disgrace to Christendom." The articles criticize the British Government for its perceived inaction and call for a more vigorous effort to end the trade, highlighting the moral imperative to protect human lives and advance Christian civilization. They also mention the successful signing of a treaty by the Sultan of Zanzibar to abolish the slave trade, indicating international efforts to address the issue. Both sources align closely with the claim, advocating for moral responsibility and intervention to eradicate the slave trade in East Africa, while also acknowledging the intertwined economic and moral motivations behind the abolitionist movement.

# The trade of diverse African commodities, including palm oil, cotton, palm kernels, ginger, and camwood, played a significant role in the economic interactions between Africa and Europe, underscoring Africa's integral position in global trade networks during the period described.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the trade of diverse African commodities, including palm oil, cotton, palm kernels, ginger, and camwood, played a significant role in economic interactions between Africa and Europe, underscoring Africa's integral position in global trade networks during the period described. The textbook highlights the production and export of primary products like palm oil, cotton, and palm kernels, emphasizing their centrality to Africa's integration into the capitalist world-economy. It notes the shift from the slave trade to cash-crop production, such as palm oil in the Niger delta and groundnuts in Senegambia, which contributed to income redistribution among ordinary people. Additionally, the increase in imports of European manufactured goods, particularly cotton goods, underscores Africa's role in global trade. However, the textbook does not specifically mention ginger and camwood, indicating a difference in the range of commodities discussed. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed evidence of the extensive trade activities involving all the commodities listed in the claim, including ginger and camwood. The articles highlight the demand and fluctuating prices of these commodities in European markets, with specific prices and quantities for palm oil, cotton, palm kernels, ginger, and camwood, further illustrating Africa's critical role in global trade. Together, these sources affirm Africa's significant economic interactions with Europe through the export of diverse commodities, although the textbook does not cover all the commodities mentioned in the claim.

# European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources to fuel their industrial demands, treating these resources as mere commodities for Western markets.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources to fuel their industrial demands, treating these resources as mere commodities for Western markets. The textbook offers substantial evidence by highlighting how mineral resources were exploited with foreign capital, often excluding Africans from benefiting, and how legislative measures were introduced to grant monopolies to imperialist interests. It discusses the neglect of industrialization in Africa, transforming African states into markets for European manufactured goods while focusing on the production of raw materials for export. The colonial economy's emphasis on cash crops led to the neglect of the internal sector, forcing Africans to produce for export rather than for their own consumption. Additionally, European commercial firms expanded the cash sector and appropriated surplus generated by peasant production through unequal exchange, illustrating the exploitative nature of colonial economic policies that prioritized European industrial demands over African development. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific examples of the extraction and transportation of African resources, such as palm oil and gold-dust, to Europe, as evidenced by the arrival of the Royal mail steamer Ethiop at Liverpool. The detailed market reports from Liverpool and London further illustrate how these resources were treated as commodities in Western markets, with specific prices and trading activities mentioned. The articles also list other African resources like palm kernels, linseed, and gum, indicating a systematic approach to utilizing African natural wealth for European industrial and commercial purposes. However, the articles notably omit the colonial context and the impact on African societies, focusing instead on economic transactions and market dynamics. Together, these sources reinforce the claim by providing historical context, examples of exploitation, and economic manipulation by colonial powers, while also highlighting the absence of explicit discussion on the exploitative nature of colonialism in the news articles.
