HH: The passage argues that Africa, having been long-neglected, requires external intervention for industrial and moral regeneration to address its challenges and advance the triumph of good over evil.

	 - From GHA: The passages from the "General History of Africa" textbook provide a nuanced view of Africa's historical interactions with external forces, particularly during the colonial period. While the claim suggests that Africa requires external intervention for industrial and moral regeneration, the text presents a more complex picture. It highlights the internal efforts of African leaders in the nineteenth century to reform their societies, often undermined by European intervention. The text also discusses the role of missionaries and colonial powers in shaping Africa's political and social landscape, sometimes justifying intervention as a means to provide security and economic opportunities. However, it also emphasizes the negative impact of colonialism, portraying it as a subversion of African self-development efforts. Furthermore, the text acknowledges the influence of Afro-American interactions and pan-African movements in expanding African political and ideological visions, suggesting that Africa was not entirely neglected but rather engaged in a dynamic exchange with the diaspora. Overall, the textbook does not fully support the claim that Africa requires external intervention for regeneration; instead, it presents a more balanced view of both internal initiatives and external influences.
	 - From TAT: The passage from the African Times news articles supports the claim that Africa requires external intervention for industrial and moral regeneration. The text emphasizes the need for Africa to be "roused to industrial vigour and productive activity" and suggests that "good must be forced upon her" through material benefits leading to moral change. It highlights the role of the African-Aid Society in organizing and urging on the "army of regeneration," indicating a belief in the necessity of external efforts to combat the "torpor of barbarism." The passage also stresses the importance of Christian civilization, suggesting that "all the forces of Christian civilization must move on together" to achieve the desired transformation. This aligns with the claim that external intervention is needed to address Africa's challenges and advance the triumph of good over evil. However, the passage does not explicitly mention Africa as "long-neglected," although it implies a need for significant change and development. Overall, the text supports the claim by advocating for external involvement in Africa's industrial and moral regeneration.


HH: The King of Dahomey perpetuated the practice of human sacrifices as a deeply entrenched cultural and religious ritual to assert power, maintain social and political control, and resist external pressures, despite concerns from missionaries and the local Christian community.

	 - From GHA: The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook do not provide direct evidence to support or refute the claim that the King of Dahomey perpetuated human sacrifices as a cultural and religious ritual to assert power and resist external pressures. However, the text does mention that the Dahomey authorities were resistant to demands from British and French abolitionists to stop the slave trade, indicating a reluctance to change traditional practices under external pressure. The text also highlights Dahomey's transition from the slave trade to palm oil trade under King Gezo, suggesting an adaptation to changing economic circumstances rather than a focus on maintaining human sacrifices. Additionally, the text discusses the role of traditional African religion in resisting colonial rule, but it does not specifically link this to the practice of human sacrifices in Dahomey. Therefore, while the text provides context on Dahomey's economic and cultural adaptations, it does not directly address the claim regarding human sacrifices as a means of asserting power or resisting external influences. This absence of information on human sacrifices in the context of Dahomey's political and social control is a notable difference from the claim.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the King of Dahomey perpetuated human sacrifices as a deeply entrenched cultural and religious ritual to assert power and maintain control. The articles describe the King's annual customs, which involved human sacrifices to instill fear in surrounding countries and assert dominance, as well as to retaliate against the English for interfering with the slave trade. The practice is depicted as a longstanding tradition, with the King continuing the rituals because they were not abolished by his predecessor. The articles also highlight the King's resistance to external pressures, such as those from missionaries and the British government, to end these practices. Despite the efforts of missionaries like Mr. Bernasko and the concerns of the local Christian community, the King maintained these customs, viewing them as essential to his authority and the social order. The articles also mention the use of human sacrifices to appease evil spirits, indicating a religious dimension to the practice. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the King's motivations in terms of resisting external pressures, although his defiance against British demands and the portrayal of the sacrifices as a cultural norm suggest a resistance to outside influence. Overall, the articles align with the claim by illustrating the cultural, religious, and political significance of human sacrifices in Dahomey, while also highlighting the challenges faced by those attempting to intervene.


HH: British intervention in Dahomey was justified by framing its cultural practices, such as human sacrifice, as barbaric and destabilizing, which allowed the British to rationalize their efforts to dismantle Dahomey's power and influence under the guise of moral and civilizing missions.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook does not explicitly mention British intervention in Dahomey being justified by framing its cultural practices, such as human sacrifice, as barbaric and destabilizing. Instead, the text highlights the British use of tactics like "divide and conquer" and exploiting African rivalries and weaknesses to their advantage. It also discusses the British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade, which led to treaties and the gradual loss of sovereignty of local rulers. The text notes that Dahomey was involved in the slave trade and later transitioned to palm oil trade under French influence, but it does not specifically link British intervention to cultural practices like human sacrifice. This absence of information on the British framing Dahomey's cultural practices as a justification for intervention is a notable difference from the claim.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim that British intervention in Dahomey was justified by framing its cultural practices, such as human sacrifice, as barbaric and destabilizing. The articles describe the Dahomeyan customs involving human sacrifices, particularly during the annual "Royal custom," and the portrayal of the King of Dahomey as a ruler who delights in such practices. The articles emphasize the British abhorrence of these customs and the need for intervention to stop them, suggesting that the British viewed their actions as a moral and civilizing mission. Additionally, the articles discuss the potential benefits of bringing Dahomeyan envoys to Britain to expose them to "advanced civilization" and humane institutions, further supporting the notion of a civilizing mission. However, there is also a mention of a treaty that allows British subjects to reside and trade in Dahomey, indicating economic interests alongside moral justifications. The articles also highlight the strategic importance of Dahomey in terms of trade routes and regional stability, suggesting that British intervention was not solely motivated by moral concerns but also by geopolitical and economic interests. Overall, the articles provide a nuanced view that supports the claim while also revealing underlying economic and strategic motivations.


HH: The British sought to neutralize the perceived threat of the Dahomey Kingdom to regional stability through diplomatic influence and military intervention, marking the beginning of European efforts to curb its aggressive actions.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific details that directly support or refute the claim that the British sought to neutralize the perceived threat of the Dahomey Kingdom through diplomatic influence and military intervention. The text mentions the French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, but it does not attribute any British military intervention or diplomatic efforts specifically aimed at curbing Dahomey's aggressive actions. Instead, the text highlights the broader context of Anglo-French rivalry and the involvement of both powers in the region due to the strategic importance of trade and territorial control. The British and French were involved in the partition of territories and protectorate declarations, but the focus is more on their rivalry and the local responses to European interventions rather than a targeted British strategy against Dahomey. This absence of specific British actions against Dahomey in the text is a notable difference from the claim.

The articles describe the British imposition of a fine on the King of Dahomey for outrages committed against British and French subjects, indicating an attempt to exert diplomatic pressure. Additionally, the blockade of Dahoman ports and the potential deployment of British troops, including the 1st West India Regiment and Houssas, suggest a readiness for military intervention. The articles also mention the establishment of British protectorates in the region, which could be seen as a strategic move to curb Dahomey's aggressive actions and influence. Furthermore, the articles highlight the British naval presence and the involvement of Commodore Sir William Hewett, emphasizing the military aspect of British efforts. However, the articles do not explicitly state that these actions marked the beginning of European efforts to curb Dahomey's aggression, nor do they provide a comprehensive overview of European involvement beyond British actions. This lack of broader European context is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, the articles align with the claim regarding British efforts but do not fully address the broader European context.


HH: The Dahomian king utilized annual ceremonies as a form of political theater to assert his authority, reinforce his legitimacy through his father's legacy, display power and wealth, and establish a centralized political structure with tributary obligations and a regulated system of taxation.

	 - From GHA: The provided paragraphs from the "General History of Africa" textbook do not explicitly mention the Dahomian king or the specific use of annual ceremonies as a form of political theater. However, they do discuss the broader context of African states, including Dahomey, and their need to centralize power, extract surpluses, and maintain a standing military force. This context aligns with the claim that the Dahomian king might have used ceremonies to assert authority and reinforce legitimacy. The paragraphs also mention the importance of centralized political structures and tributary obligations in various African states, which could be analogous to the regulated system of taxation mentioned in the claim. However, the specific details about annual ceremonies, the reinforcement of legitimacy through a father's legacy, and the display of power and wealth are not directly addressed in the textbook excerpts. This absence of specific information about Dahomey's ceremonial practices is a notable difference between the claim and the textbook content.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the Dahomian king utilized annual ceremonies as a form of political theater to assert his authority and reinforce his legitimacy through his father's legacy. The articles describe the commemoration of the victory over the Ayors, highlighting the king's efforts to change the customs to his own fashion and emphasize his father's triumphs. The ceremonies involved elaborate displays, such as the king being surrounded by Amazons and singers, and the symbolic act of having twelve Ayor people carry silk damask and cotton shirting to signify the end of tributary obligations. This aligns with the claim of using ceremonies to display power and wealth. Additionally, the articles mention the collection of tribute and the extortionate demands of silk damask, which suggests a regulated system of taxation. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the establishment of a centralized political structure, which is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, the articles provide evidence of the king's use of ceremonies to assert authority and display power, but they do not fully address the aspect of centralized political structure.


HH: The Dahoman government's use of captured Ayors in ceremonial roles, alongside the symbolic use of silk damask to challenge cultural norms, reflects a complex legal and moral system that both revered and feared authority, while also reversing power dynamics and challenging the narrative of Dahomey as a violent society.

	 - From GHA: The provided paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook do not contain any specific information about the Dahoman government's use of captured Ayors in ceremonial roles or the symbolic use of silk damask to challenge cultural norms. The text does discuss Dahomey's transition from the slave trade to palm oil production and the use of war captives as labor, but it does not mention ceremonial roles or the use of silk damask. Additionally, the text does not address the legal and moral systems of Dahomey in the context of reversing power dynamics or challenging narratives of violence. This absence of information on the specific claim highlights a notable difference, as the textbook does not provide details that directly support or refute the claim regarding Dahomey's cultural practices and power dynamics.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim regarding the Dahoman government's use of captured Ayors in ceremonial roles and the symbolic use of silk damask. The articles describe a ceremony where twelve Ayor individuals were made to carry silk damask and cotton shirting, symbolizing a reversal of power dynamics, as these materials were previously demanded as tribute by the Ayors. This act was intended to demonstrate the victory and independence achieved by the Dahoman king's father over the Ayors, thus challenging cultural norms and asserting Dahomey's authority. The articles also highlight the complex legal and moral system in Dahomey, where authority was both revered and feared, as seen in the ceremonial use of captured individuals and the symbolic gestures of power. However, the articles also depict Dahomey as a society with violent practices, such as human sacrifices during the "Royal custom," which contrasts with the claim's suggestion of a narrative challenging Dahomey as a violent society. This duality reflects the complexity of Dahomey's legal and moral system, where authority and power dynamics were intricately woven into cultural and ceremonial practices.


HH: The construction of royal monuments in Dahomey using human blood symbolized the intertwining of ritualistic violence, political power, and the subjugation of enemies, reflecting broader practices of using ancestral trophies in political and spiritual negotiations in African societies.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about the construction of royal monuments in Dahomey using human blood, nor does it explicitly discuss the intertwining of ritualistic violence, political power, and the subjugation of enemies in the context of Dahomey. However, the text does touch upon themes of ritual power, political authority, and the use of violence in various African societies. For instance, it mentions the use of religious symbols and rituals in legitimizing rulers and defending sovereignty, as well as the role of secret societies like the Ekpe in political systems. Additionally, the text discusses the use of spiritual resources in resistance movements and the integration of religious and political authority. While these themes are related to the broader practices of using ancestral trophies in political and spiritual negotiations, the specific claim about Dahomey's royal monuments and the use of human blood is not directly addressed in the textbook. This absence of specific information on Dahomey represents a notable difference between the claim and the content of the textbook.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the construction of royal monuments in Dahomey using human blood. The articles describe the practice of building a "Beadshouse" over the graves of deceased kings, where the mud for the walls is mixed with human blood, often from enemies, as part of the ritual. This practice symbolizes the intertwining of ritualistic violence and political power, as it involves the subjugation of enemies and the use of their blood in constructing these monuments. Additionally, the articles mention the use of human blood in the construction of monuments as a tribute to the deceased king, further reflecting the broader practice of using ancestral trophies in political and spiritual negotiations. The articles also highlight the political significance of these rituals, as they are tied to the king's military successes and the subjugation of enemies, aligning with the claim's assertion of the intertwining of violence, power, and spiritual practices in African societies. However, the articles do not explicitly mention the use of ancestral trophies in political negotiations, which is a slight difference from the claim. Overall, the articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim, with minor differences in the specific details of ancestral trophies.


HH: In African societies, the use of elaborate monuments, symbolic artifacts, and ceremonial customs underscores the cultural and political significance of honoring ancestors, demonstrating authority, and maintaining diplomatic relations.

	 - From GHA: The paragraphs from the "General History of Africa" textbook provide several details that align with the claim regarding the cultural and political significance of honoring ancestors and demonstrating authority through symbolic artifacts and ceremonial customs.

HH: Tensions and potential conflicts between colonial powers and local African communities were exacerbated by aggressive and disrespectful actions from British forces, reflecting broader resistance to colonial interference in governance and trade.

	 - From GHA: The paragraphs from the "General History of Africa" textbook provide several details that support the claim that tensions and potential conflicts between colonial powers and local African communities were exacerbated by aggressive and disrespectful actions from British forces. The text highlights instances of British interference in local governance, such as the imposition of chiefs who were not traditionally qualified, as seen in the Asante uprising of 1900. The demand for the sacred Golden Stool by the British governor, which was a profound symbol of Asante identity, exemplifies the disrespectful actions that fueled resistance. Additionally, the British use of violence and mercenaries to impose authority, as noted in the resistance by the Nandi in Kenya, further supports the claim. The British tactic of "divide and conquer" and their exploitation of African rivalries also align with the claim of exacerbating tensions. Furthermore, the imposition of taxes and forced labor, as well as the undermining of local trade monopolies, such as those held by the Mazrui family, illustrate the broader resistance to colonial interference in trade. These examples collectively demonstrate the aggressive and disrespectful actions of British forces that intensified conflicts with African communities, aligning with the claim.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that tensions and potential conflicts between colonial powers and local African communities were exacerbated by aggressive and disrespectful actions from British forces.

HH: Some Africans believed that the British monarchy was unaware of the injustices and unjust treatment carried out by its colonial representatives, who were influenced by local intrigues.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook does not explicitly address the claim that some Africans believed the British monarchy was unaware of the injustices carried out by its colonial representatives. The text primarily focuses on the colonial administration's paternalistic and authoritarian nature, the manipulation of traditional leadership, and the imposition of European bureaucratic structures. It highlights the resistance of African leaders to colonial rule and the discontent among both traditional and educated elites. While the text discusses the British interest in treaties and interventions, it does not mention any belief among Africans that the British monarchy was ignorant of the injustices perpetrated by its representatives. This absence of information on the specific claim is a notable difference, as the text does not provide evidence of such a belief among Africans regarding the British monarchy's awareness or lack thereof.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide details that support the claim that some Africans believed the British monarchy was unaware of the injustices and unjust treatment carried out by its colonial representatives. In the first paragraph, there is a suggestion that the English Queen and Government might not be aware of the actions of their consul or war officers, as it is mentioned that these actions might be unknown to the Queen or the Government. This aligns with the claim that the monarchy was perceived as being uninformed about the conduct of its representatives. Similarly, in the second paragraph, there is an appeal to the British monarchy, expressing confidence that the Queen does not wish to exercise power wrongfully and suggesting that the conduct of agents, such as Colonel Conran, is puzzling and possibly contrary to her instructions. This further supports the notion that there was a belief in the disconnect between the monarchy's intentions and the actions of its colonial agents. The third paragraph, while not directly addressing the monarchy's awareness, highlights the negative impact of local intrigues and the unjust treatment of African dignitaries under British protection, which could imply a lack of oversight or awareness by the British authorities. Overall, the articles provide evidence that some Africans perceived a gap between the British monarchy's intentions and the actions of its colonial representatives, influenced by local intrigues.


HH: The British colonial strategy in Africa relied heavily on military force and local intermediaries to suppress resistance, protect territorial interests, and maintain control, as evidenced by coordinated military efforts against uprisings and the use of emigrants to establish covert military presence.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim that the British colonial strategy in Africa relied heavily on military force and local intermediaries. The text describes Britain's use of military imperialism, as seen in the punitive expedition against Benin in 1897 and the conquest of Nigeria, including the annexation of Asante and the Sokoto sultanate. The British employed a combination of diplomacy and military confrontation, with Nigerian reactions varying from open military confrontation to alliances and submission. The use of local intermediaries is evident in the British strategy of divide and rule, exploiting African rivalries and employing African levies in their military campaigns, as seen in the conquest of the Zambezi valley and the British occupation of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. However, the claim about the use of emigrants to establish a covert military presence is not explicitly supported by the text. Instead, the focus is on the use of local African forces and the strategic manipulation of local rivalries to maintain control. This highlights a difference between the claim and the textbook content, as the latter does not mention the use of emigrants for covert military purposes.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim regarding British colonial strategy in Africa.

Similarly, the campaign against Nupé highlights the use of military action to enforce treaties and suppress slave raiding, further supporting the claim of using force to maintain control. Additionally, the articles mention the strategic placement of local leaders, like Masambah Kokie, to cultivate peace and manage local affairs, indicating the use of intermediaries. However, the claim about using emigrants to establish a covert military presence is not directly supported by the articles, as there is no mention of such a strategy. This absence is a notable difference, suggesting that while military force and local intermediaries were indeed part of the British strategy, the specific tactic of using emigrants for covert military purposes is not evidenced in these articles.


HH: The rise in human sacrifices under the new King of Dahomey suggests a shift in the political or religious climate, potentially influenced by groups using spiritualism to manipulate the King and maintain traditional practices, with local leaders possibly complicit in these harmful customs.

	 - From GHA: The provided paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook do not directly address the claim regarding a rise in human sacrifices under the new King of Dahomey or any potential manipulation by spiritualist groups. Instead, the text discusses Dahomey's economic transition from the slave trade to palm oil production, influenced by external trading pressures, particularly from a French trading firm. This shift suggests an adaptation to changing economic conditions rather than a focus on spiritual or religious practices. The paragraphs also highlight the broader socio-political and economic changes in various African regions, including the influence of Islam and Christianity, the restructuring of political systems, and the integration of new cultural elements. However, there is no mention of human sacrifices or spiritual manipulation in Dahomey, indicating a significant difference between the claim and the textbook content. This absence of information on human sacrifices or spiritual manipulation in the textbook is a notable divergence from the claim, suggesting that the claim may not be supported by the historical context provided in the textbook.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim regarding the rise in human sacrifices under the new King of Dahomey. The articles describe an increase in the number of people killed during the Sorsi custom, with the new King executing ninety men compared to the previous King's limit of thirty. This suggests a shift in the political or religious climate, as the new King appears to be more extreme in his practices. However, the articles do not explicitly mention the influence of spiritualism or manipulation by groups to maintain traditional practices in Dahomey. Instead, the mention of spiritualism and manipulation is associated with Madagascar, where the King is influenced by superstitious beliefs and spiritual messages, leading to a resurgence of heathen customs. The articles do not provide evidence of local leaders in Dahomey being complicit in these harmful customs, nor do they suggest that spiritualism is being used to manipulate the King of Dahomey. This is a notable difference, as the claim implies a connection between spiritual manipulation and the rise in human sacrifices in Dahomey, which is not supported by the articles.


HH: The Kingdom of Dahomey uniquely integrated female warriors, known as Amazons, into its military and cultural life, challenging traditional gender roles and European military norms by relying on their bravery and strategic significance in both combat and ceremonial roles.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides details that support the claim about the Kingdom of Dahomey's integration of female warriors, known as Amazons, into its military and cultural life. The text mentions that Dahomey had a permanent army that included both men and women, with the Amazons being a feared component of this force. This aligns with the claim that Dahomey challenged traditional gender roles by incorporating female warriors into its military. The Amazons' involvement in combat is highlighted, as they were part of the compulsory military service during wartime. However, the text does not explicitly discuss the ceremonial roles of the Amazons or how their presence challenged European military norms, which are aspects mentioned in the claim. Overall, the textbook confirms the strategic significance of the Amazons in Dahomey's military but does not provide a comprehensive account of their cultural and ceremonial roles or their impact on European perceptions.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim about the Kingdom of Dahomey's integration of female warriors, known as Amazons, into its military and cultural life.

For instance, the Amazons are noted for their indomitable courage, with reports of them scaling walls under heavy fire and charging enemy troops multiple times. They are described as more ferocious than their male counterparts and are often intoxicated before battle to enhance their fearlessness. The articles also mention the Amazons' role in ceremonial customs, such as carrying prisoners and participating in the King's customs, which underscores their cultural significance. These details align with the claim that the Amazons challenged traditional gender roles and European military norms by being integral to both combat and ceremonial roles in Dahomey. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the broader impact of the Amazons on European military norms, focusing instead on their actions and roles within Dahomey. This absence of direct commentary on European perceptions is a notable difference from the claim.


HH: The militaristic and brutal nature of Dahomey society, characterized by the capture and sacrifice of war prisoners, ritualistic violence, and severe human rights abuses, underscores the reliance on warfare and traditional practices for maintaining power and resources.

	 - From GHA: The provided paragraphs from the "General History of Africa" textbook do not explicitly address the claim regarding the militaristic and brutal nature of Dahomey society, particularly in terms of capturing and sacrificing war prisoners or engaging in ritualistic violence. Instead, the text focuses on Dahomey's economic transition from the slave trade to palm oil production, highlighting the use of war captives as labor rather than as commodities for export. This shift indicates a change in the utilization of captives, aligning more with economic adaptation than with ritualistic violence. Additionally, the text discusses broader regional changes, such as the emergence of new social structures and governance in response to warfare, but does not specifically attribute these to Dahomey. The absence of direct references to ritualistic violence or severe human rights abuses in the context of Dahomey suggests a difference between the claim and the textbook content, as the latter emphasizes economic and social transformations rather than militaristic brutality.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the militaristic and brutal nature of Dahomey society. The first paragraph describes the capture and sacrifice of war prisoners, referred to as "poor Ayors," who were caught in war and later killed as part of a customary ritual. This aligns with the claim of ritualistic violence and the use of warfare to maintain power. Additionally, the description of the "Horses' Custom" and the two types of customs, Attor and Sorsi, further illustrates the ritualistic violence, with the latter involving the execution of individuals fastened to poles. The articles also mention the involvement of the Amazons, a female military regiment, which underscores the militaristic aspect of Dahomey society. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the reliance on traditional practices for maintaining resources, focusing more on the violent customs and the execution of war prisoners. The other paragraphs in the articles do not directly relate to Dahomey but rather discuss violence and societal issues in other regions, such as the actions of Egbo runners and the oppressive practices in Old Calabar. These details highlight the broader context of violence and traditional practices in West African societies during this period, but they do not specifically address the claim about Dahomey's reliance on warfare for resources.


HH: The Kingdom of Dahomey utilized ritual killings and human sacrifices, justified by religious beliefs, as a means to demonstrate power, instill fear, and manage captives, while these practices also served as significant cultural events that engaged both local and European participants.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides some details that align with the claim regarding the Kingdom of Dahomey's use of ritual killings and human sacrifices. The text mentions that Dahomey was motivated by the demand for slaves for export and for labor, as well as for the purpose of human sacrifice at the well-known annual customs. This suggests that human sacrifices were indeed a part of Dahomey's cultural practices, potentially serving as significant events. However, the text does not explicitly state that these practices were used to demonstrate power, instill fear, or manage captives, nor does it mention the involvement of European participants in these rituals. The focus is more on the economic and cultural motivations behind the invasions and the use of captives. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim regarding the cultural significance of human sacrifices, the textbook does not provide comprehensive evidence for all aspects of the claim, particularly the involvement of Europeans and the specific purposes of demonstrating power and instilling fear.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the Kingdom of Dahomey's use of ritual killings and human sacrifices. The articles describe "evil nights" where numerous men were killed, and their heads were displayed as trophies, indicating a ritualistic aspect to these killings. The mention of human sacrifices offered to idols and gods, with structures built using human blood and skulls, further supports the claim of religious justification for these acts. The articles also highlight the cultural significance of these events, such as the "custom" or massacre held in memory of deceased leaders, which involved both local chiefs and European merchants, although the latter refused to attend. Additionally, the articles describe the use of human sacrifices to appease evil spirits, aligning with the claim of religious motives. However, the articles do not explicitly mention the participation of European participants in these rituals, which is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, the articles corroborate the claim that these practices were used to demonstrate power, instill fear, and manage captives, while also serving as significant cultural events.


HH: The Kingdom of Dahomey played a pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade, with its economy and the authority of its rulers heavily reliant on the trade, while the King justified its continuation by blaming foreign demand, suggesting that its abolition required addressing this demand and exploring alternative commerce, despite the significant economic and historical impact on the region.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding the Kingdom of Dahomey's role in the transatlantic slave trade. It highlights that Dahomey's economy was heavily reliant on the slave trade, with King Gezo continuing to supply slaves to Portuguese dealers despite European abolitionist pressures. The text also notes that Dahomey was a persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state, with its rulers delegating the trade's management to chief vassals, indicating the authority of its rulers was indeed tied to the trade. Furthermore, the textbook mentions that Dahomey eventually transitioned to palm oil trade as an alternative, reflecting the claim's suggestion of exploring alternative commerce. However, the textbook does not explicitly state that King Gezo justified the continuation of the slave trade by blaming foreign demand, although it does imply that Dahomey authorities were aware of the demand from Brazil-based Portuguese dealers. Overall, the textbook supports the claim's depiction of Dahomey's pivotal role in the slave trade and its economic reliance on it, while also acknowledging the shift towards legitimate trade as a response to changing economic conditions.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the Kingdom of Dahomey's pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade. The articles highlight that Dahomey's economy and the authority of its rulers were heavily reliant on the slave trade, with Whydah being a principal port for slave exportation. The King of Dahomey is noted to have justified the continuation of the trade by blaming foreign demand, particularly from Cuba, and suggested that its abolition required addressing this demand. The articles also mention the King's interest in exploring alternative commerce, such as palm oil, but emphasize that the slave trade remained a significant economic activity. Furthermore, the articles discuss the British efforts to suppress the trade and the challenges faced, including the need for diplomatic engagement with Dahomey. These details align with the claim's assertion of Dahomey's economic and historical reliance on the slave trade and the complexities involved in its abolition. However, the articles do not explicitly address the historical impact on the region, which is an interesting difference from the claim.


HH: The passage suggests that Christian England and other nations have a moral obligation to intervene and abolish the slave trade in East Africa, viewing it as essential for aligning with a vision of moral purity and advancing Christian civilization and industrial progress.

	 - From GHA: The passage from the General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim that Christian England and other nations felt a moral obligation to intervene and abolish the slave trade in East Africa. It highlights the role of the humanitarian spirit and evangelical movement in advocating for the abolition of the slave trade, driven by a vision of moral purity and the propagation of Christianity. The passage notes that abolitionists sought to regenerate Africa through Christianity, civilization, and legitimate commerce, reflecting a moral and civilizational mission. Furthermore, it mentions that missionaries, often acting as agents of European colonialism, encouraged European intervention as a morally justified undertaking, particularly from the 1870s onwards. This aligns with the claim that the abolition of the slave trade was seen as essential for advancing Christian civilization. However, the passage also suggests that economic and industrial progress, stemming from the Industrial Revolution, played a significant role in changing attitudes towards the slave trade, as new productive capacities made slave labor less profitable. This economic dimension adds complexity to the claim, indicating that the motivations for abolition were not solely moral or religious but also economic. Overall, the passage supports the claim while also highlighting the intertwined economic and moral motivations behind the abolitionist movement.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles strongly support the claim that Christian England and other nations have a moral obligation to intervene and abolish the slave trade in East Africa. The articles emphasize the need for Great Britain to take decisive action against the slave trade, describing it as a "devastating and brutalizing curse" and a "disgrace to Christendom." The text criticizes the British Government for its perceived inaction and calls for a more vigorous and well-supported effort to end the trade, highlighting the moral imperative to protect human lives and advance Christian civilization. The articles also mention the successful signing of a treaty by the Sultan of Zanzibar to abolish the slave trade, indicating international efforts to address the issue. Furthermore, the text suggests that the abolition of slavery is essential for the progress of Christian civilization and industrial development, aligning with the claim's vision of moral purity and advancement. Overall, the articles align closely with the claim, advocating for moral responsibility and intervention to eradicate the slave trade in East Africa.


HH: The trade of diverse African commodities, including palm oil, cotton, palm kernels, ginger, and camwood, played a significant role in the economic interactions between Africa and Europe, underscoring Africa's integral position in global trade networks during the period described.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the significant role of diverse African commodities in economic interactions with Europe. The text highlights the production and export of various primary products, including palm oil, cotton, and palm kernels, which were central to Africa's integration into the capitalist world-economy. It notes the expansion of cash-crop production, such as palm oil in the Niger delta and groundnuts in Senegambia, which replaced the slave trade and contributed to a redistribution of income among ordinary people. The text also mentions the increase in imports of European manufactured goods, particularly cotton goods, which underscores Africa's integral position in global trade networks. However, the textbook does not specifically mention ginger and camwood, which are part of the claim, indicating a difference in the range of commodities discussed. Overall, the textbook aligns with the claim by emphasizing Africa's role in global trade through the export of key agricultural products, although it does not cover all the commodities listed in the claim.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that the trade of diverse African commodities, such as palm oil, cotton, palm kernels, ginger, and camwood, played a significant role in economic interactions between Africa and Europe. The articles detail the extensive trade activities involving these commodities, highlighting their demand and fluctuating prices in European markets. For instance, palm oil is frequently mentioned with specific prices and quantities, indicating its importance in trade. Similarly, cotton sales are reported with detailed price fluctuations and quantities, underscoring its economic significance. Other commodities like palm kernels, ginger, and camwood are also regularly traded, with specific prices and quantities noted, further illustrating Africa's integral position in global trade networks during the period. The articles do not refute the claim but rather provide a rich context that aligns with the assertion of Africa's critical role in global trade through the export of these commodities.


HH: European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources to fuel their industrial demands, treating these resources as mere commodities for Western markets.

	 - From GHA: The paragraphs from the "General History of Africa" textbook provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources to fuel their industrial demands, treating these resources as mere commodities for Western markets. The text highlights how mineral resources were exploited with foreign capital, often excluding Africans from benefiting, and how legislative measures were introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. It also discusses the neglect of industrialization in Africa, turning African states into markets for manufactured goods from Europe while focusing on the production of raw materials for export. The colonial economy's emphasis on cash crops led to the neglect of the internal sector, forcing Africans to produce for export rather than for their own consumption. Additionally, the text describes how European commercial firms expanded the cash sector and appropriated surplus generated by peasant production through unequal exchange. These details align with the claim, illustrating the exploitative nature of colonial economic policies that prioritized European industrial demands over African development. The text does not refute the claim but rather reinforces it by providing historical context and examples of exploitation and economic manipulation by colonial powers.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim that European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources for Western markets. The arrival of the Royal mail steamer Ethiop at Liverpool with a large cargo of palm oil and gold-dust from various African ports highlights the extraction and transportation of African resources to Europe. The detailed market reports from Liverpool and London further illustrate how these resources, such as palm oil, sugar, and camwood, were treated as commodities in Western markets, with specific prices and trading activities mentioned. The articles also mention other African resources like palm kernels, linseed, and gum, which were part of the trade, indicating a systematic approach to utilizing African natural wealth for European industrial and commercial purposes. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the colonial context or the impact on African societies, which is a notable omission. This absence of context is a significant difference, as it does not directly address the exploitative nature of colonialism, focusing instead on the economic transactions and market dynamics.
