20,European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources for export to satisfy their industrial and market needs.,"The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources for export to satisfy their industrial and market needs. The textbook highlights how colonial economies were structured around the production of primary products, such as agricultural crops and minerals, which were exported to Europe, leading to monocrop economies highly sensitive to international trade conditions. It emphasizes the exploitative practices of European commercial firms, such as unequal exchange and appropriation of surplus generated by peasant production, alongside forced labor and land appropriation that facilitated resource extraction. The integration of African economies into the world economic order is described as disadvantageous and exploitative, although some African leaders and societies saw advantages in maintaining foreign trade relations. Similarly, The African Times articles detail the significant export of resources like palm oil, rubber, gold, ivory, and timber from West Africa to Europe, particularly to the United Kingdom and Germany. They note the role of British merchants in expanding the palm oil trade and the establishment of trading stations by European companies. While the articles highlight the economic benefits and local industry stimulation from this trade, they also reflect on challenges such as labor needs and the impact on local societies. Together, these sources illustrate the extensive involvement of European powers in extracting and exporting African resources, aligning with the claim of systematic exploitation to meet European industrial and market demands.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources for export to satisfy their industrial and market needs. The text highlights how colonial economies were structured around the production of primary products, such as agricultural crops and minerals, which were exported to Europe. This export-oriented economy was largely disadvantageous to African states, as it led to monocrop economies highly sensitive to international trade conditions. The role of European commercial firms in connecting Africa with Western markets is noted, emphasizing their exploitative practices, such as unequal exchange and appropriation of surplus generated by peasant production. The text also discusses the forced labor and land appropriation that facilitated the extraction of resources, further illustrating the exploitative nature of colonial rule. Additionally, the integration of African economies into the world economic order is described as disadvantageous and exploitative, aligning with the claim. However, the text also notes that some African leaders and societies perceived advantages in maintaining foreign trade relations, suggesting a complex interaction rather than a one-sided exploitation. Overall, the textbook provides a detailed account that supports the claim of systematic exploitation by European colonial powers.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that European colonial powers systematically exploited African resources for export to satisfy their industrial and market needs. The articles highlight the significant export of palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, and other resources from West Africa to Europe, particularly to the United Kingdom, Germany, and other European countries. The development of the palm oil trade, for instance, is noted as having been rapidly expanded through the efforts of British merchants, who transitioned from the slave trade to legitimate commerce. The articles also mention the establishment of trading stations and the involvement of European companies in the extraction and export of African resources, such as gold, ivory, and timber. Additionally, the articles discuss the role of European merchants in stimulating local industries and the economic benefits derived from the trade of African commodities. However, the articles also reflect on the challenges faced, such as the need for labor and adequate machinery, and the impact of European commercial interests on local societies. While the articles do not explicitly frame these activities as exploitation, they do illustrate the extensive involvement of European powers in extracting and exporting African resources to meet their industrial and market demands, aligning with the claim.",True,20,Economic Impact and Trade Dynamics,Resource Exploitation,"[{'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

The colonizers had to supplant the Arab, Swahili and Indian merchants. Experiences in East Africa underscored the premise that colonial activities first centred around parts of Africa which had a prior involvement in inter› continental exchange. The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region. By the mid 1880s, the Scramble was already taking place on Lake Victoria, on whose shores colonial enterprises were quickly grafted on to the already high level of African economic activity. When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form. North African economies were as much part of a Mediterranean complex as they were part of the African trans-Saharan network. Prior experience with the European economy allowed segments of North African society to accommodate to the intensifi› cation of production for Europe and to the spread of European commodities in local markets. But the well-defined and exploitative ruling class was determined to defend state frontiers, even if willing to enter closer economic relations with Europeans. Therefore, colonial rule often advanced while maintaining North Africans in nominal authority, and the colonial economy was institutionalized before the complete subjugation of the indigenous polities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'reliance on captives enabled free men to collect ivory, wax and rubber for overseas export. The Lozi aristocracy and landlords also used slaves to dig canals and ditches in order to bring fertile marshy soil into cultivation. By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position. To the extent that slaves acquired as corvØe labourers tended to become chattel, the nature of slavery often changed from earlier forms which emphasized the reproductive role and the use of slaves primarily to expand the size of the kinship network. accompanied the raids and the expansionist activities of the slave-traders. Fields were ravished, entire villages destroyed and survivors often com› pelled to flee their homelands and resettle in inaccessible, unproductive locations. One nineteenth-century traveller recalled the effect of the Yao raids in the 1860s against the Manganja: A number of the Manganja went with them. Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert. About midday they came upon a large party of Ajawa [Yao], who were just returning from a successful raid. The smoke of burning villages was seen in the distance.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials.

When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Indeed, Africans had been present in Western Europe from Classical Antiquity onwards, though the numbers only became substantial from about the fifteenth century on, when black Africans, first as slaves and then as freedmen, began to appear in southern Spain and Portugal, arriving at first by way of the trans-Saharan trade to North Africa. Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did. From 1685, residence in France was held to confer freedom, and the same was true of England after the notable judicial decision of Lord Mansfield in 1772 already noted. In both situations, however, slaves from the colonies were still slaves de facto; in many instances until the European powers abolished slavery in the colonies themselves, in 1834 for Britain, 1848 for France, and 1888 for Brazil.\nIn spite of their ambiguous legal status, free Africans were present in Western Europe in considerable numbers from at least the mid-eighteenth century on. Estimates vary, but by 1800 they would have numbered several thousand in each of Spain, Portugal, France, or Britain; and in Spain or Portugal they would have been more numerous in an earlier period. The numbers were small in any case, compared with total European populations, but the African immigrants tended to be concentrated in the main cities, particularly in the port towns, so that their presence was more visible than their numbers would suggest.$^{31}$ It goes without saying that, for any period before the 1840s, far more people of tropical African descent would have been found in Europe than Europeans in tropical Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 1, 'article_title': 'THE WEST AFRICAN MAILS.', 'full_section_title': 'THE WEST AFRICAN MAILS.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_02_1862#article-1', 'issue_date': '22_02_1862', 'content': 'The Royal mail steamer Ethiop arrived at Liverpool on the 9th inst.

The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour.

For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The data for Lagos are for 1862.

The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632.

Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it.

A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array.

This was and is useful enough for Africa, and beneficial to the merchant, as far as it can prudently go. But Africa now wants more than this. She wants powerful companies, that shall prudently but boldly stimulate and assist her to a much higher and more extensive industrial development. The Company of African Merchants is, and is intended to be, such an one. That it will open to England the great national storehouses of African cotton, we have no doubt; while it will be at the same time be helping forward and reaping other portions of its harvests in the long-opened fields of oils, gums, and other such articles of African produce. We long to see it, and we hope that we shall see it and kindred efficient organizations, take hold of certain richly-endowed districts of Africa with a firm and solid grasp—with a determination to squeeze from them their abundant natural stores, enriching them and elevating them morally and socially in the process—with a firm resolve to employ all those wealth-creating means which advancing civilization in Europe has gradually discovered and applied for stimulating industry and diffusing wealth, comfort, peace, and happiness, among mankind.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Lagos seems to be the most flourishing of the West African colonies; partly due to its comparatively good harbour, its low tariffs, and the enterprise of its population, a large portion of which are emigrants from Sierra Leone, and a good many from Brazil.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Page 154\n\nIts value.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Neither the British government nor the mining monopolies which emerged from the 1870s had any intention of leaving mineral resources under the control of the Boers or of allowing priority to settler agricultural concerns with arable land, water, pasture and cattle, when the subsoil and African labour promised huge surpluses exportable to the metropolises. Boer social formations combined elements of the slave plantation, the feudal fief and the patriarchal community, in addition to capitalist commodity relations. After the Kimberley diamond finds (1870) and particularly after the Witwatersrand gold strike (1886), the bourgeoisie was determined to impose hegemony over all pre-capitalist social formations in South Africa, irrespective of race. The Anglo-Boer wars (1899-1902) were also antiimperialist resistances, albeit in a perverse sense, since at the same time they sought the further entrenchment of settler colonialism.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported.

It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed.

In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.724, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Dependence and repression, 1930-8', 'content': 'The international division of labour presented itself within the colonial economies as an ever-widening divergence between production and con› sumption. The bulk of the production within the growing money economy was never intended to meet local demand and consumption. Conversely, the variety of goods obtainable at the retail markets were increasingly of foreign origin. Local artisanship suffered heavily from European competi› tion and manipulation, along lines already manifest in the pre-colonial period. As the colonial economy became firmly rooted in the 1920s, Africans were producing that which they did not consume and consuming that which they did not produce. In effect, domestic demand did not stimulate the maximization of domestic resources. As a further deleterious consequence, the colonizers wasted some African resources and ignored others, because their yardstick was the utility of the given resource to Europe rather than Africa. None of the major economic elements such as savings, investment, prices, incomes and output were correlated in response to domestic require› ments. For these structural reasons, recent research by African economists and historians has challenged the old formulations of colonial development and has posited instead that colonialism produced economic dependence, lopsidedness and underdevelopment. 14 The most significant event in the evolution of African economies in the inter-war period was the great depression of 1929-33.

Certainly this type of production had not been unknown in the tribute-based economies of the savanna: slaves worked the fields of the leading political families of the mussumba, for example. But, in the nineteenth century, the accumulation of captives by certain privileged groups often coincided with the rapid growth ofa marketrelated sector of the economy rather than with economic expansion due to increased payments of tribute-money. We have seen the result in the role played by 'domestic slaves' in the demographic and agricultural expansion of some of the communities in the region, such as the Kongo, Ovimbundu, and Ovambo.\nIn Angolan colonial society, the slave trade was likewise linked to the capitalist market economy, and had grown to sizeable proportions by the second half of the nineteenth century. In spite of certain legal tech› nicalities - slavery was formally abolished in Angola in 1878 - a slave labour sector was certainly the basis of the boom in cotton, plantation coffee, and especially sugar-cane production.

The tendency of West African merchant firms to monopolize through 'pools' is well known, and trading companies throughout the continent guarded their interests by refusing to compete in such a way as to raise prices. Indeed, intermediaries such as the 'Asians' in East Africa and the Lebanese in West Africa also set prices and conditions among themselves so that the African peasant had little choice when he went to make his sales. The cash-crop farmer faced the prospect of being gypped at the weighing scales, in the processing stage (as with the cotton ginnery), in transportation, in the calculation of returns and in the repayment of loans or advances where applicable. African producers were also making retail purchases from the middlemen traders and the commercial firms. A fundamental inequality marked the exchange between the colonial economy and the metropolises. This unequal exchange was reflected in the disparity between the low remuneration Africans received and the relatively high cost of manu› factured imports; and it also manifested itself in the low wage rate in the colonies as compared with the metropolises. Of course, unequal exchange was not a purely economic phenomenon. It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': 'From the late fifteenth century onwards, Africa participated in the Europeoriented world economy as a peripheral and dependent sector. But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves. Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation', 'content': ""Donald Denoon has put the point neatly: When we speak of the Scramble for Africa, we generally mean the European division of African territory and sovereignty.

The frightful evils attendant upon this trade have been demonstrated by the experience of every ruler who has attempted to administer the affairs of Native States with any regard for the well-being of the Natives; they have been recognised by the chiefs in different parts of Africa, and have been discussed at international conferences, notably those of Berlin and Brussels in 1885 and in 1890. There is no doubt in the minds of experienced and practical men that the supply of intoxicating liquor to the Native races is equivalent to the demoralisation and degradation of the races concerned, and that the first condition of progress is to keep alcohol out of their reach. This is not a temperance fad or a philanthropic counsel of perfection. It is the judgment of unromantic men of business, that an essential preliminary to successful administration is to prevent the supply of spirits to the Native. A century ago Adam Smith wrote of the trade in rum which the American colonies carried on with the coast of Africa, ""whence they bring back negro slaves in return."" The conscience of the world has since been so far aroused that the return cargo of those days is no longer possible. It is but a step further to realise the fact that to sell a man to a master who has a commercial interest in taking care of him and who may be even kind, is fraught with consequences less terrible than to sell him to the domination of his own drunkenness, which in the case of the negro is surely merciless.\n\nYet at present what do we find? In the colony of Lagos about 1,700,000 gallons of spirits go every year for local consumption, and in the Niger Protectorate 1,355,000 gallons more. The duties are low enough to make the traffic profitable on the coast and to encourage Native trade with the interior. In the territory of the Niger Company a determined stand has been made against the trade. The Deputy-Governor of the Company, Sir George Goldie, urged upon the Conference of Berlin the international restrictive policy which was afterwards adopted at the Conference of Brussels, and one of the first acts of the Company after receiving their charter was to impose a heavy duty upon spirits crossing their frontier. Later on, it totally prohibited the introduction of spirits into about one-third of the inland portion of its sphere, and in 1890 the prohibition was extended to ""any place within the jurisdiction of the Company north of the 7th parallel of north latitude."" The proximity of the two colonies in which liquor is cheap renders prohibition on the coast impracticable. And though the trade is restricted, coast Natives cannot be deterred from obtaining spirits so long as there are spirits on the coast.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS COMMISSIONERSHIP', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people?

Over large areas drink is almost the sole currency, and in many parts the year\'s wages of the negro factory worker are paid altogether in spirits.\n\nWe read with shame and alarm the wanton acts of misgovernment, which are of periodical, if not constant, occurrence on the West Coast of Africa, from the Gambia down to the mouth of the Niger and the Oil Rivers District. The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

This traffic is actually increasing, owing to the apathy of her Majesty\'s Government.

The protectorate, announced at Bonny, in December last, by Admiral Sir Walter Hunt Grubb, extends from the right bank of Benin river to the Rio del Rey, thus including Brass, New and Old Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, and other important trading stations.\n\nTwo series of considerations, the internal and external, have combined to render action imperative, and a retrospective view may not be uninstructive. Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo. He collected his scattered family, dependants, and slaves, and made his escape to the Opobo river.

J. Irvine & Co.'s Palm Oil Report for November"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that has just expired has witnessed the continuance and, indeed, the aggravation of that painful depression in the trade of West Africa which existed in 1886. The average prices in Europe of the more important native products have stood even lower than during the previous twelve months, while the prolonged continuance of low prices in Africa has apparently disheartened the native producer, and tended to diminish the quantity as well as the value of his out-turn. In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos. Great numbers of clerks and artisans, anxious for engagements as heretofore at various parts of the coast, are unable to obtain employment, or only at reduced rates of wages.\n\nTo these communities 1888 will probably bring good tidings. It has been stated, on apparently good authority, that early in the new year the so-called ""oil rivers""—now under intermittent Consular jurisdiction—will be formed into a Colony. The experiences of Lagos and the Gold Coast enable us to predict, with tolerable certainty, the results which will follow from this policy. These valuable regions will be rapidly settled and opened up to trade. Hitherto, owing to the prevalence of the barter system, the unsettled condition of the tribes, and the absence of order and justice, only wealthy European houses have been able to make the necessary provisions.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1888#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In another column we have just briefly noticed the pamphlet dealing with the Liquor traffic of Africa which has been lately issued by the C.M.S. as the outcome of a Committee of Delegates of the British Missionary Societies appointed to consider this subject as it concerns the natives of Africa. This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ...

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some of the Difficulties in the Way of Extending Trade in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The gold-mining industry, which it was hoped a few years ago would have done much for the colony, has not succeeded as it deserved, and that from many causes.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL INTERESTS IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""commerce if carried by steamers. The demand for kola nuts was reported to be at all times considerable in Brazil, but in view of the slowness of the passage and the difficulty of keeping them in marketable condition, the value has at no time during the past six years exceeded £3,563, while in 1877 it sank as low as £304. Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN ""MIDDLEMAN"" AND OTHER HINDRANCES TO TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The populations seen in the towns on the river banks must not be taken as a proof that the parts not visited are equally populous; and we must remember that the negro, when first he becomes acquainted with the fabrics of the looms of Europe, does immediately array himself in fathom upon fathom of calico.

Another question which has to be overcome in the Upper Congo is the difficulty and cost of transport between Vivi and Stanley Pool. The American officers sent to report on the advantages to the trade of the United States to be expected from the opening up of the Congo, say that on this section there was famine and disease, and that even the employés of the International Association were suffering from these causes, and that transport was both scarce and costly.\n\nUntil some better route is opened up, the trade of the Upper Congo can only be tentatively opened, as it is doubtful if ivory even will be able to stand the great cost of carriage. The trade on the Lower Congo is rapidly increasing in value and importance; but some disastrous ventures have been made, and investors have been deterred from joining in enterprises for its development on account of some businesses which have not realized the prospects held out by their promoters. The Dutch are the largest traders in the Lower Congo, and the slave trade continued longer there than in any other place on the West Coast; and even after it was put a stop to, many of those who had been engaged in it remained, and brought into more legitimate trade the lawless habits they had acquired in their previous avocation; and the native inhabitants of the creeks and shores of the stream were lawless and fierce, and not unfrequently indulged in piracy. The expedition under Sir William Hewett, in 1875, put a great check on their practices, and since then both English and Portuguese men-of-war have chastised breaches of law and order, but some of the worst offenders amongst the Europeans managed to escape the punishment they merited.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1885#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

Similarly, The African Times articles detail the extensive trade of palm oil, ivory, and rubber exported from Africa to Europe under burdensome export duties, leaving little profit for local traders. The imposition of trade regulations is further highlighted by the extortionate export duties in the Congo Free State, criticized for harming local economies. The articles also describe deceptive practices by European merchants, such as inserting boards into cloth to increase weight and selling short-measured goods, leading to retaliatory adulteration of produce by African traders.

All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa.

It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Viewed from a somewhat different perspective, the unequal value of commodities exchanged reflects the fragile position of the region within the larger international trading system. As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

But, in the nineteenth century, the accumulation of captives by certain privileged groups often coincided with the rapid growth ofa marketrelated sector of the economy rather than with economic expansion due to increased payments of tribute-money. We have seen the result in the role played by 'domestic slaves' in the demographic and agricultural expansion of some of the communities in the region, such as the Kongo, Ovimbundu, and Ovambo.\nIn Angolan colonial society, the slave trade was likewise linked to the capitalist market economy, and had grown to sizeable proportions by the second half of the nineteenth century.

The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation.

Gin bottles and boxes meet the eye at every step, and in some places the wealth and importance of the various villages are measured by the size of the pyramids of empty gin-bottles which they erect and worship. Over large areas drink is almost the sole currency, and in many parts the year\'s wages of the negro factory worker are paid altogether in spirits.\n\nWe read with shame and alarm the wanton acts of misgovernment, which are of periodical, if not constant, occurrence on the West Coast of Africa, from the Gambia down to the mouth of the Niger and the Oil Rivers District. The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died. For this offence he was tried at Accra in August 1889, but the charge of murder preferred against him having been withdrawn, he was convicted of assault only, and sentenced to...\n\nThe Acting Chief Justice to pay a fine of £5 and enter into his own recognisances to keep the peace for six months!\n\nThe curse of drink, misrule, flogging, murder, torture, and other atrocities has caused the black to ask, ""From whence come these white savages, who are more savage than ourselves?"" Slavery and slave-dealing has been renewed under our rule on the Gold Coast. ""Quite recently 5,000 girls and boys were brought from Salaga and other districts in the interior for sale at Accra and other English territory on the coast. This traffic is actually increasing, owing to the apathy of her Majesty\'s Government.

Or, license duty at 4 frs.; export duty at 2 frs.; total, 6 frs., or about 26⅓ per cent.\n\nWho will not call such duties exorbitant?\n\nThis becomes the more apparent, as ivory is very divergent in value, regulating itself according to the weight of each tusk.\n\nThe tusks weighing over 20 lbs. English, are generally the dearest, then follow those of from 10 to 20 lbs., whilst the cheapest are less than 10 lbs.\n\nDuring the last two years we sold in eight successive sales in London: Tusks of over 20 lbs. English, from 30 frs. to 23 frs. per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram is 13½ to 17½ per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram is 20 to 26 per cent. Tusks from 10 to 20 lbs. English 27,75 frs. to 21,74 frs. per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram is 14⅓ to 18⅓ per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram is 21⅓ to 27⅓ per cent. Tusks below 10 lbs. English 19,75 frs. to 10,80 per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram, is 20 to 37 per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram, is 30 to 55½ per cent.\n\nIt requires no argument to prove that, with such burdens, the ivory trade is impracticable to the Congo trader. The buying is done in small lots at a time. He who purchases a lot of small ivory is by no means sure of securing large ivory later on. The negro will no longer be able to barter the article for goods.

The practice briefly described is this: In a piece of cloth weighing about eight lbs. a piece of plank or board weighing about two lbs. is inserted, the cloth being wrapped around the board and the whole is thus increased to ten lbs. in order to deceive the natives into the belief that the piece is all cloth and that they are buying a large quantity of cloth and which is indicated by its great weight. It is nothing but right in point of justice, that as the law punishes natives for soaking their palm kernels or adding other kinds of stuff to them in order to increase their weight, that the same law should provide a punishment for those who sell cloth thus deceptively made up, and which is nothing more than fraud of the very worst kind, as coming from people who call themselves civilised and Christianised, and who should know better.\n\n""I think the matter ought to engage the attention of the Government, and that an Ordinance should be passed inflicting a punishment on all merchants selling satteens in which a plank or board is found concealed, exactly as the natives are punished who adulterate produce.\n\n""Facts are very stubborn, and if by my frankness in exposing the vile practice I should give offence to the parties concerned, it should not be regarded as an offence but as demanding fair play.

It is a serious question, and it has done the merchants considerable damage. Merchants have made loud complaints about the palm kernels being soaked in water before they are brought down for shipment. This practice arose because the native found the white man cheated him in the length of the piece of cloth sold to him. It is useless for merchants to think that a native can be so easily deceived— that 28 yards can be palmed on him for 30 yards. This practice having become so extensive, the natives—not being able to remedy it—adopted a mode of adulterating their produce, which took the form of soaking the kernels in water for weeks before bringing them down for sale, and occasionally secreting a brick or other heavy substance among the kernels, all of which resulted in the native getting a greater weight allowed to him, and consequently taking a considerable amount of goods in value which he would not otherwise have obtained. The merchants came out the losers very considerably, both native and European; for not only did the weight in kernels diminish, but the kernel was practically valueless, inasmuch as the sweating produced while on board the ship during transit to Europe, through being wet, was such that to a great extent the kernels were rotten when they arrived at their destination. Thus freight was lost in addition to the price of a false quantity of kernels, to say nothing of the kernels themselves. I had occasion to speak about this subject when in Manchester, and I was met with the reply, ""Ah, it is a custom to make cloth 30 yards and send only 28 yards."" So is it a custom in London, as the late Master of the Rolls once said, to steal a man\'s pocket-handkerchief at one end of the street and offer it to him for sale at the other end of it; but that custom does not make it honest. The practice of short lengths in respect of reels of cotton is abominable. I do think that it is hardly possible to conceive a more bare-faced robbery. I have seen gross after gross of reels of cotton marked with 50 or 60 yards which really did not hold half the quantity.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed. A large portion of the trade was doubtless in slaves, but still that alone could never have accounted for the prosperity and wealth of the merchants who traded with Western Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In another column we have just briefly noticed the pamphlet dealing with the Liquor traffic of Africa which has been lately issued by the C.M.S. as the outcome of a Committee of Delegates of the British Missionary Societies appointed to consider this subject as it concerns the natives of Africa. This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN ""MIDDLEMAN"" AND OTHER HINDRANCES TO TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the course of some excellent articles which have appeared lately in the *Manchester Guardian*, dealing with the present and future trade prospects of Africa, we have one chapter devoted to the consideration of the drawbacks upon genuine commerce by the enforcement of such quasi-regal rights as those exercised by Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, and the rest of that host of petty kinglings, in the districts of the West Coast. The article in question says:—\n\nOne of the ways in which the development of trade must be carried out is by pushing factories up beyond the tribes who now serve as middlemen between the European trader and the native producer. Some difficulty will no doubt be encountered in passing through the unhealthy and malarious districts in which these middlemen live, but the improved knowledge we are obtaining of how to combat climatic diseases will render such an enterprise more easy than it would have been twenty years ago. Indeed, if we contrast the early reports of the Niger with its present exploitation, we may believe that the climate of no tropical country will permanently prevent its being opened up to commerce. This is a ray of hope for our African traders, and it is to be hoped that our Government will enable them to avail themselves of it speedily, and not allow them to be forestalled by the merchants of other nations. As if the inaction of our Government had not been sufficiently disastrous to the trade of the African merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, the home legislation of the last few years has also done much to hamper their enterprise. One industry alone, which, though it may be considered a small one, came in the aggregate to a considerable amount, has been completely driven out of the country. The trade in matches to the West Coast used to be supplied by Manchester. Now, the children who used to be employed in their manufacture are sent to school hungry, while German matches are sent in German ships to those who used to buy the English ones, and the only profit to English people is that of the middleman, and even that is being rapidly taken from them.\n\nThe German and French textile manufactures are also running us close, and we have to watch carefully the change of fashions and ideas among the natives. Many cheap articles made in France, with a ready sale on the coast, could easily be made in England. Some of the native manufactures could easily be imitated, such as the Niger cloths and the silk and cotton cloths made by the Santees and Ashantees of unravelled European stuffs. Beyond the Oil rivers to the south we have the French colony of the Gaboon, which has now become one of the largest tracts of Africa controlled by an European nation.

A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . . It has sometimes been to us a question whether these persons did ever really intend to repay the loans they so freely squander away when they sought for them.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The French Merchant from Elmina, in Ashanti', 'section_title': '', 'content': "".**  \n_TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES._  \nQuittah, May 10, 1882.\n\nMy dear Sir,—A great deal of sensation was caused here by the report recently brought by three men of the plunder of their property on the River Volta whilst on their way to Salagha. The statement of these men is somewhat alarming, and presents a new feature in the history of plunder and brutal treatment to persons which from time to time are reported to us as taking place on that river. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL INTERESTS IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""commerce if carried by steamers. The demand for kola nuts was reported to be at all times considerable in Brazil, but in view of the slowness of the passage and the difficulty of keeping them in marketable condition, the value has at no time during the past six years exceeded £3,563, while in 1877 it sank as low as £304. Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa.

In Kenya, for instance, Africans were forbidden to grow coffee, 'by far the most lucrative cash crop' in the country.$^{41}$ It was not until the 1950s that this European monopoly was shattered by Mau Mau.\nThe main result of all these steps was the proletarianization of the African peasantry, which appears to have taken place on a larger scale in Southern Rhodesia than in the other countries under discussion.$^{42}$ Thus African labour employed by Europeans at starvation wages produced cash crops for both the home market and for export. In Kenya, by 1927, between 83700 and 117 000 Africans, or more than 50% of total wage labour, worked in commercial agriculture. The leading crops were maize, coffee, wheat and sisal. Maize occupied only 325 ha in 1905; by 1920 it occupied nearly 12500 ha, and nine years later the area had risen to over 90000 ha.$^{43}$ By the early 1920s the settlers had ousted African peasants from the production and trade of this important staple. The area under coffee also recorded a dramatic expansion, rising from 32 ha in 1905, reaching over 11250 ha in 1920, and shooting up to nearly 39000 ha ten years later.$^{44}$ In 1913 coffee and maize exports earned the country £64991; in 1920 export of these two crops and sisal earned £566556 and their value reached £2429655 in 1930, with coffee accounting for more than 50%.$^{4S}$ These developments led to significant structural changes. In 1913, the exclusive African sector contributed 24% of the value of total domestic exports while the exclusive European sector contributed only 5%. Evidently by this time, African labour had made little impact on commercial agriculture.

This economic pattern and the complexity of ethnic stratification are attributable to the ways in which colonization proceeded, which in turn was determined by the natural conditions and the vast natural wealth of that part of Africa.\nBy 1919 the historical tenor of economic life in most of Southern Africa had been upset to a greater degree than in other parts of the continent. Millions of people had been drawn into the sphere of capitalist exploitation. By the middle of the 1920s more than 200000 migrant workers, recruited from as far away as Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, were employed in the South African mines.$^{2}$ Upwards of 60000 labourers worked in the copper, tin, diamond and gold mines of the Congo. 3\nBecause of the development of European farming and large-scale expropriation of land from the peasants in a number of Southern African countries, African participation in the production of export crops and in trade was thwarted except in sectors of forced production such as cotton in the Congo.$^{4}$ Similarly, the road was barred to the emergence of a large stratum of African capitalist farmers and merchants, which is a feature of many other colonies where there were much fewer white settlers. Loss of land, strangulation of the peasantry, proletarianization and urbanization were thus processes that went faster and deeper in most Southern African countries than in other parts of Africa. 5\nA permanent and numerically significant proletarian body of African and non-European descent was, it has been seen in Chapter 16, forming more rapidly in a number of Southern African countries. Its more advanced contingents were represented by workers in the industrial cities and ports. Most of the African labour in mining and in the cities was initially recruited from seasonal workers. Yet an increasing number of people came to depend on the seasonal occupation for their livelihood, and, over time, a process of labour stabilization occurred. As a result, the emergence of an African urban proletariat was more advanced there than in most parts of West and East Africa.

Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

The process of land alienation and its political and economic repercussions in Kenya and Southern Rhodesia have been well documented by M. P. K. Sorrenson 3 and Giovanni Arrighi.$^{4}$ It has been argued that British perception of economic activity in Kenya at the beginning of the twentieth century led them to look for economic agents from outside. Contrary to welldeveloped peasant agriculture found in Uganda (especially in Buganda) under the control of centralized political institutions, the argument goes, the economies of most communities in Kenya were too backward to be relied upon as a springboard for economic growth. Consequently, the argument concludes, white settlers were chosen to form the base of economic life of the dependency.$^{5}$ This line of thought offers only part, and the lesser part, of the explanation. There were many parts of the British Empire where indigenous economies were miserably undeveloped. The coastal regions of Kenya are a case in point. The fact that these regions were spared from settler colonization clearly indicates that the Kenya Highlands had something special to offer for European settlement. Evidently it was the temperate climate above other factors, which attracted the white settlers. The land occupied by settlers was mostly over 1400 m above sea level. Such areas were among those with the highest and most reliable levels of precipitation. In short, the alienated land was situated in the most favourable agricultural zones.\nThe beginning of land alienation in East Africa was discussed in Chapter 7. It took a dramatic trend especially in Kenya after 1909 and was carried out at give-away prices. In 1903 only about 2000 ha had been alienated to Europeans in Kenya. By 1914 the area alienated had risen to about 260000 ha and to about 2740000 ha in 1930.$^{6}$ This was a very substantial chunk of the arable land, bearing in mind the fact that the Kenya Highlands (about 90000 sq km) comprised less than 15% of Kenya's area and yet supported over 75% of the total population of the country until the 1930s.

Equally guilty of overstatement are those colonial apologists, such as Gann, Duignan and Lloyd who see colonialism as an unqualified blessing for Africa as well as those like Perham and Fieldhouse who see the record as a balanced one. A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development. Finally, metro› politan industries benefited from cheap raw materials obtained from the colonies and profits made from the export of manufactured goods. When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.601, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': 'From the late fifteenth century onwards, Africa participated in the Europeoriented world economy as a peripheral and dependent sector.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

Central Africa, with its low population density, was the arena for concession companies, infamous for forced labour. Such settled agriculture as was developed in Central Africa, continued with coercion over a rural proletariat, as on the sugar, sisal and cotton plantations of Mozambique and Angola, or it became capital-intensive, as in the Belgian Congo. It was possible for Lever Brothers to set up oil palm plantations in the Belgian Congo from 1911. Their requests to have similar concessions in British West Africa were turned down, because the colonial administration correctly perceived that such a venture would necessitate the violent subjugation of thousands of inhabitants. Besides, the colonialists had early proof in West Africa of the success and viability of the African peasantry in producing an exportable surplus and lucrative returns to the European trading community. French persistence with settler agriculture in West Africa demonstrated its inferiority vis-à-vis African small-scale production. In East Africa, Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia, the settler economy had to be subsidized and protected from African competition by legislation, without which it could not have secured enough labour.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present.

I used to go to Lagos (where I belong to) sometimes for change on account of health, and returned to the said mentioned Jaja, and since then from the war of 1869, which brought us all to this river (Opobo), when only two Europeans entered this river, Mr. Sterling, agent for Charles Horsfall and Son, came in the river and traded with Jaja and his chiefs. At first, Consul Livingstone refused to protect them, but by much complaining to the Foreign-office in London, he was obliged to protect them. All their letters regarding the same were written by me, although I am an African born; I am obliged to act on the part of Jaja; and since the war was finished in January, 1873, trading has been going on very briskly. I, myself, am only trying with what little wages I got from Jaja during the time I was working for him. I asked permission of King Jaja to try to trade a little in the only way I then could—i.e., by bringing country clothes from Lagos to Opobo to be bartered for palm oil. The King agreed to this in consideration of the long time I was with him. I tried my best to pick up some few casks of palm oil with the country cloths, and against the time of my shipping oil, I took the oil on board the steamship Forcados, British and African Steam Navigation Company, to ship this oil to Liverpool. The captain refused to receive the oil, stating that the chairman in this river refused to allow him to receive any oil from us in the town, even from the natives. Since then, I have never been allowed to ship my oil to Liverpool. I did not know what to do; I had written to the agents of the Company, but received no reply. I cannot write to the Consul anything respecting it, as I believe the Consul is all for the Europeans in this river, because the Consul once asked King Jaja why he did not send away every Sierra Leone and Lagos man from his town. The King answered him, how can he drive human beings like himself from his country, since they had done nothing wrong? To this the Consul had nothing to say, only stating that he will not protect us as British subjects. Is this right on the part of Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, to insist on an African king turning out an African born man from his country? Dear Mr. Editor, I will only for the present ask you to notice these great evils in your paper, and try your very best to enable us to ship our palm oil from this river from time to time. We are poor Africans; we are in need of trying our best to pick up a few pence for our daily...\n\nbread, and we are very sorry to see the way these big merchants are trying to ruin us poor Africans, by preventing the captains of the mail steamers from receiving poor Africans' palm oil on board of their steamers."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-10-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1874#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.561, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GOLD COAST ECONOMY, &c.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In consequence of the extraordinary freak of these gentlemen, about one acre of land in the middle of Cape Coast Town is now piled with large heaps of wood, that exhibit symptoms of rapid decay, and would require five thousand soldiers for ten years to consume at the present scale of rations.

For arrow root that cost 3d. per lb. at Sierra Leone the same fortunate contractor for wood was allowed 2s. 6d. per lb.; for salt that cost less than a penny a lb. 6d. per lb. was allowed; for vegetables that could be bought by the cartload for 2d. per lb. 6d. per lb. was allowed.

I said to some of them: \'You are spending millions of money on a line in which it must be wasted. Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty. The enterprises in East Africa, both of Englishmen and Germans, are only commercial movements, not colonisation, and are not only liable to but will share the fate which has befallen all great European, secular or religious, movements in equatorial Africa. You rightly consider that the agents in the work of Africa\'s regeneration are the civilised and Christianised negroes now in exile. Mahometanism, notwithstanding the sneers of some and the ignorance of others, is doing a wonderful work in Africa, really preserving the people against the unscrupulous proceedings of European traders and adventurers. The Arabs can do no harm, they as readily follow as lead in negro land. Jesus Christ as a religious reformer and as a regenerator of all the races of mankind was right. These organisations, which undertake to represent Him among foreign races, have not yet half understood Him, and He will not endorse work which not only contravenes the spirit but the letter of his teachings.

Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade.

In the present famine of gold, it is very necessary that all sources of supply of the precious metal should be utilized; but until the conditions under which mining is pursued on the coast of Africa are fundamentally altered, the person who would invest money in the exploitation of gold mines would be very sanguine and would prove also very unfortunate.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.568, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Produce Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that has just expired has witnessed the continuance and, indeed, the aggravation of that painful depression in the trade of West Africa which existed in 1886.

In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season.

Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

The most extraordinary feature of this vast region is that a very large proportion of the food is of a type that was unknown there five hundred years ago.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round.

The invasion of wetter, tropical Africa by cultivated crops was less successful, although the locally domesticated yam was rain-tolerant and grew well enough on the forest margins as did the West African variety of rice. Early in the Christian era plants more suited to equatorial Africa, the banana (especially its large non-sweet variety, the plantain) and the Asian yam reached East Africa and slowly spread westward.$^{36}$ But the conquest of the forest was a long slow process and agriculture and population grew slowly within its confines, so slowly indeed that up to the fifteenth century the forested northerly part of the Congo basin seems to have been sparsely occupied by hunters and food-gatherers and considerable areas are still occupied by these people. 37 In terms of demographic history, the important point is that the forest was the home of very few people five hundred years ago. The major exceptions were the fringes, the coast and the important inter-regional routes. For instance in Nigeria an example of the first is the lagoon area either side of Lagos, of the second is Old Oyo, and of the third is both Ife and Benin on the route which crosses the Niger at the lowest point where it is easily accessible and crossable before reaching the delta.

To take another Nigerian example, and a contemporary one, the opening up of the wet forest south of Ondo (and to the south-east of the massively crowded central Yorubaland) to intensive cultivation has largely been a product of the building of the road from Ijebu Ode to Benin in the early 1960s.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and jingoism to hear it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white.

In Africa, when the king dances, you have to pay for the honour. The natives here bear a bad reputation. Mr. Mann\'s scarlet blankets greatly excited their cupidity.

Mr. Saker being unarmed, the defence lay with his three companions. However, as the fumes of the rum left their brains, the people became quiet. But a new difficulty arose. The chief Moyambi came and demanded 500l. for permission to ascend. Of course he was refused, and he then lowered his demand to 300l.

One of their customs in trading is to break a small twig or piece of wood as the concluding ceremony of a bargain, otherwise it is not complete, and the goods can be reclaimed. One afternoon my servant came rushing in to tell me he had bought a good-sized goat for an old 2 lb. meat tin. He was in such a hurry to communicate the news, he forgot to break the customary twig over the transaction.

Having explained that at the departure of the previous mail he could not despatch a letter, as he was far out of reach of communication, the distinguished Consul, who dates from “Native Village on the Akayafe River, near Old Calabar, Feb. 18, 1887,” writes: “Ever since Jan. 26 I have been leading a strange but far from disagreeable life, exploring and surveying a large district between Old Calabar and the Cameroons. To do the water part of the journey, I hired at Old Calabar a large native canoe, with a house in it—an arrangement resembling the house-boats on the Thames. At one end of it is a large box full of sand. On this the cooking fire is made, which is kept up day and night. In the house, which has two small windows and two sliding doors and a thatched roof, there is just room for my bed, dressing bag, table, chair, and canteen. The canteen is a wicker-work box, with knives, forks, plates, &c. There are shelves and hooks in the house, by which a lot of things are stored away. Outside the house, in the forward part of the canoe, is a clear space with a level floor and small seats round, sheltered by an extension of the thatched roof. Here in daytime I put my table, and sit either eating my meals or making my survey. This is really most pleasant. The motion of the canoe is so smooth that I can write or draw unshaken, and when the table is laid with a white cloth, napkin, and bright silver, it almost provokes an appetite. Many little incidents enliven our daily peregrinations. Sometimes an elephant is descried crossing the river or feeding on the banks. Then there is a rush for guns, and we fire away at him with all kinds of fire-arms. I am bound to say we have not yet succeeded in killing one; when they are wounded they get away into dense bush, where it is impossible to follow. Or a flock of birds comes into sight, and one or more of them falls to my gun. Towards evening we make for some native village, where we can sleep in shelter, and can renew our provisions of fowls, eggs, bananas, and such like. Some of my experiences in these towns would make you laugh, but they are too long and full of detail to recount. These natives are far from being savages, though it is only a short time since cannibalism prevailed among them, and even now, up in the interior, small boys are regularly fattened on a special diet for the market. The houses are built after Oriental custom, in a hollow square with an open court in the centre, round which the dwelling rooms are situated. In the centre of the court a small tree always grows, placed there more out of superstition than from any aesthetic idea. The inner walls of the building are made of plastered clay. There are also clay settees and benches, along which pretty native mats are laid. Fanciful designs in colour and basso-relievo adorn the walls and benches in many places. A number of brass plates form a feature in the decoration. Muscovy ducks, goats, and hairy-maned sheep wander about the courts, seeking what they may devour. The women pass their time in cooking, and vary the monotony with loud-tongued quarrels and disputations. At night you are put to sleep in a little alcove, on a raised bed of clean mats, and except that the playful rats leap and frolic over you—they are little black rats, not the foul brown rat of home—your rest is secure and undisturbed. Then in the morning, when the dew lies on the grass blades and the palm fronds, and the grey parrots are flying in flocks to their feeding haunts in the fig trees and the calamus palms, you take leave of your host, having bestowed on him a gift of tobacco, cloth, and a knife; and you once more proceed on your journey, not knowing what you will see, where you may arrive, or whom you will meet, but enjoying the element of chance so largely figuring in a life like this. We are now just returning from having visited some lovely scenery. I traced the course of the stream as far as its falls—the inevitable falls which every African river develops before quitting the interior tableland for the coast. This consisted of two magnificent cascades of 40ft. each, the total descent being over 80ft. Of course, this is nothing wonderful for a waterfall, but these are specially remarkable for their picturesqueness, their eminently paintable quality. The rocks stemming the torrent were fantastic in shape, and rich colors, with natural tints and colouring of lichen, &c. The whole scenery was framed with magnificent tropical forest. Round these falls were many beautiful wild flowers, especially the wild white anemone, the smaller original form of our cultivated arums. I am sending this letter to Old Calabar with the rest of my correspondence. An old native has agreed to take them for five leaves of tobacco.” The letter concludes by expressing the writer’s hope that he will be able to “run home” this summer, to England.'}, {'id': 6802, 'article_title': 'GERMAN EXPLORATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'GERMAN EXPLORATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1897#article-10', 'issue_date': '04_01_1897', 'content': 'Messrs.

They discovered unmistakeable traces of gold on the Olchitanda, in Cassinga, and on both sides of the Kunene, the banks of which they describe as very healthy. They infer that a very brisk weapon trade with the natives of German South-West Africa is carried on on the Kunene, from the fact that the Natives wanted to buy ammunition of them, with oxen, ""for the war with the Germans""—a desire which, of course, remains ungratified. The travellers discovered a small and, hitherto, unknown bay, three kilometres broad, about thirty kilometres south of the mouth of the Kunene, and named it the Augusta Victoria Bay, after the German Empress.

Professor Drummond is a clear and accurate observer, and has a real interest in the human side of African life; he is able to present us with pictures not often met with in books of African travel. The deadly nature of the tropical coast is forced on our attention, the uplands beyond this border rising from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet, and the high table-land of the interior 4,000 feet to 6,000 feet, where the fervour of the sun is so modified that even the European, with care, may lead a healthy life. A subject on which Mr. Drummond takes a somewhat original view is the capacity of the native African for labour. He gives pictures of the ordinary life of the African. He has never had any need nor any stimulus to hard work; he has no more conception of that than he has of purity. But that he cannot be trained to appreciate both Mr. Drummond strenuously combats. As to hard work, conducted with method and effect, he points to the road between Nyassa and Tanganyika, made entirely by native labour, under European superintendence. Then we have the plantations around Lake Nyassa, manned by natives. About these facts there can be no doubt. But it must be remembered that these natives have been in the hands of the all-patient missionary, or of men deeply imbued with the missionary spirit. The mere trader, of whatever nationality, has no such patience; he looks for immediate results and high dividends, and solves the difficulty by ""contract labour."" The cruelties of the African slave raids Mr. Drummond brings out with saddening realism. One of his maps shows the great areas which have been laid waste by the slaving Arabs and the vast regions which still form their hunting grounds. We are frequently told of the rapid extinction of the elephant and the exhaustion of our supply of ivory. That is certain, and Mr. Drummond states that the event will happen within comparatively few years. But he does not lament the extinction of so fine an animal, even although it has never yet been trained to useful work. The fact is that ivory and slave-raiding are intimately associated in Africa. For every tusk obtained, a slave must be begged, borrowed, or stolen to carry it. And until the supply is exhausted, attention will never be given to the other more permanent resources of the continent. So the sooner the elephant is extinct, the better, he thinks, it will be for Africa. Mr. Drummond\'s chapter on the white ant will be found especially interesting even to those who are not naturalists; while the maps—six in all—which serve to illustrate ""Tropical Africa,"" give one an excellent idea of the physical and political condition of Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1888#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen. The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed.

Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'most advanced of the Native States of the African continent, whose territory had been the prey of outside Powers, and he showed that the dawn of African exploration and partition commenced with the Phoenicians, who navigated the Mediterranean for an unknown period, and founded the city of Utica about 1,100 B.C., nearly 300 years before the foundation of Carthage. The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry. A modern traveller had truly said that ""the greatest treasure of Africa consists in the inexhaustible labour force of its inhabitants."" The Native population, which was estimated at about 200 millions, only required to be organised by the whites in order to raise the natural wealth of the continent. A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon. Africa required railways and highways in every part for the purpose of its economic development and civilisation. Rinderpest must be exterminated.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

As Karl Vogt says, ""Our civilisation came not from Asia, but from Africa, and Heer has proved that the cultivated plants in the Swiss lake-villages are of African, and, to a great extent, of Egyptian origin."" According to Logan, the pre-Aryan civilisation of Southern India had a partially Egyptian character. The oldest races, he asserts, were of a variable African type which spoke languages allied to the African. Egypt, and not India, is the common cradle of all we have in common, east, west, north, and south, all round the world. The languages, beliefs, rites, laws and customs went out to India, but did not return thence by means of the apocryphal Aryan migrations. The Indian affinity with our European folk-lore and fairyology is neither first nor final, \'tis but the affinity of a collateral relationship.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion.

It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country.

In 1932 Imperial Preference was introduced in British dependencies. Imports from the British Empire had customs duties fixed at between 10 and 50% lower than the general level. But since trade between the dependencies was negligible, the intended beneficiary of the arrangement was obviously Britain. In September 1931 the Colonial Office dispatched a circular to officers administering depen› dencies asking them to help Britain and reminding them that: the interests of the United Kingdom and those of the Colonies and Dependencies are inseparably bound up with one another, that the perils which face the United Kingdom are perils which menace the whole Empire ... that any general collapse of British credit and declir - in the exchange value of sterling must spell ruin for the colonies no less than for the United Kingdom. 83 Despite the higher tariff on non-British goods, their importation, to the advantage of consumers in the dependencies, increased greatly.

In 1934 a further attack was made on non-British goods by raising the tariff to 100%, as a general rule. In addition, a quota system was imposed on the importation of Japanese textiles.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'As an eminent economist has pointed out, \'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically. Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa. African technological development was thereby halted and was never resumed until after independence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

The dependencies remained important sources of primary products with hardly any industrial sectors. Through participation in the cash sector, African peasants and workers experienced with the rest of the ,vorld some of the most serious economic adversities between 1929 and 1935. Neither the worker nor the peasant was a beneficiary of colonial economic relations, but the former experienced worse exploitation. The appropriation of the surplus by international capital is revealed by the backwardness and general poverty of the dependencies during the mid-i930S. Colonial administrators attempted, often feverishly, to arrest the increasing deterioration of soil fertility, especially in the native reserves where population pressure threatened land productivity, by restricting African cultivation. But Euro› pean exploitation of different resources was nowhere restricted. No one suggested, for example, that minerals should not be mined because they could never be replaced.$^{114}$ And mining, generally considered to be a modern sector, contributed only marginally to industrial life. As a matter of fact, mining thrived on the peasant sector by paying workers starvation wages.

Plantains, yams, cassava, rice and maize were produced by West African peasants with the very simple technology which the British met at the end of the nineteenth century. Things were not different in the production of bananas, maize, cassava, millet, and a variety of other crops in East and Central Africa. In an average year most families produced enough for home consumption and put a small amount into the exchange sector. But to both the official and unofficial agents of imperialism, the subsistence sector was of little interest as it did not directly promote the interests of international capital. Unlike the export sector, it did not earn the badly needed foreign currency with which to pay for imports, nor did it provide raw materials to feed the factories of the metropolis.

With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock. First, it did not involve any fundamental technological innovation. Second, many of these crops or similar ones had been grown and processed long before the colonial era.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.754, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': 'From the late fifteenth century onwards, Africa participated in the Europeoriented world economy as a peripheral and dependent sector. But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland. Therefore, distance from the coast was one of the determinants of how early the colonial economy could be set in motion.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': 'African resistance helped substantially to dictate a slow pace of economic colonization for at least the three decades between 1880 and 1910. Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930. Cotton, palm oil, coffee, groundnuts and cocoa illustrate such characteristics in the parts of the continent with which they are respectively associated.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""The role of the European commercial firms has been assessed by many scholars, most of whom agree on the significance of connecting Africa with markets in Western Europe and the Americas.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': 'rulers.

They demanded the transport and marketing infra› structure, seizing the opportunity as soon as a railway line was completed. In many cases, they pioneered before the colonial governments had built bridges and feeder roads. Seed for new crops were taken from the colonial governments, from missionaries, from European farms and from Africans who were already engaged in cultivation. Cocoa and coffee are the two best known and most important of the cash crops whose extension relied mainly on African initiatives. Minor crops such as tea, tobacco and pyrethreum also bear out the same principle. Besides, Africans fought specifically for crops which were better money-earners than others. In the case of cocoa, this meant cultivating lands which were only marginally suitable. At other times, African preference precipitated a struggle against discriminatory colonial legislation. Thus, the latter part of the 1920s and the early 1930s saw a determined effort on the part of Africans in several highland areas of Tanganyika to cultivate Arabica coffee rather than hire their labour out or grow the less profitable Robusta variety. The Africans won literally by planting coffee trees faster than the colonial administration could destroy them. 10 Where peasant cultivation established itself as the hegemonic form of the colonial economy, it functioned like mines and plantations in drawing labour resources from an area much wider than the actual zone of production. Senegambian groundnut farming attracted seasonal labour from the hinterland of the Senegal and Niger rivers; cocoa in the Gold Coast and in the Ivory Coast drew upon Upper Volta; while Ugandan coffee-growers turned to Ruanda-Urundi and Tanganyika to expand output. Together, cash-crop farming and the wage labour of mines and agri› culture accounted for the overwhelming majority of Africans who partici› pated directly in the colonial economy. However, a host of other activities were generated or transformed by the new commodity relationships. It was rather late before the extensive forest reserves of the continent were seriously maximized, but an extractive timber industry arose early in Gabon and in varying degrees some such enterprise was pursued wherever forest reserves existed. The transportation network was a factor of more general significance. Thousands of Africans found wage employment at the ports on the trains, and - as road networks developed - as lorry drivers, especially when head porterage declined after the First World', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'South Africa, 1880-1935', 'content': ""Of the British African colonies and dependencies, so unique and so pheno› menal and yet so notorious in their impact were the economic changes that occurred in South Africa during the period under review that they merit separate treatment here, however briefly.\nBy 1869, South Africa - consisting of the two British colonies of Cape Colony and Natal and the Boer or Afrikaner settler-colonies of Transvaal and Orange Free State - was economically as poor and as peripheral to the world capitalist economy as any of the other European colonies and settlements in Africa (see Fig. 27.1).

There were, however, some important variations from colony to colony in each region.\nIn Uganda and to a lesser extent Tanganyika, most of the fertile land was owned by the indigenous population, the Africans. With a few ex› ceptions, for example Buganda in Uganda, the Bukoba and Kilimanjaro areas in Tanganyika and Gikuyuland in Kenya, land did not acquire market value on a large scale, and it was held communally. Every member of the community had the right to land. In most cases it was labour, and not land, which was the scarcer means of production.\nForeigners, mostly British, secured and held concessions on land with mineral and timber resources, but such arrangements had little adverse effect on the local agricultural communities. In some cases, however, serious hardships were faced where mineral resources were located on rich arable land.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

And this can only be effectually done by a systematic and regular navigation of its waters, and commerce with the people on its banks. British manufacturing necessities and Niger peculiarities make this case of Niger navigation and commerce an exceptional one. A desultory navigation and trade in the river might now be attended with consequences that would retard the development of as rich a country as any in the world. We want to hasten that development. Great Britain requires it. There is no safety for her manufactures till it is done. African cotton alone can give security to Manchester mill-owners and operatives. And African cotton will come, if we seek properly for it. The Gambia and the Sherboro rivers are beginning with their contingents. The movement has commenced in those rivers, and there are agencies in those rivers to stimulate the production. But the Niger has need of a larger system of stimulus; it imperatively demands a powerfully-organised commerce; and then it will speedily pour its latent wealth into the lap of England. The mills of Manchester and Stockport, of Ashton and Preston, will yet shout for joy through the cotton wealth of the Niger districts. We beg our readers to refer to the article headed ""Cotton! cotton! cotton!"" in this number of our paper. We have there given extracts from journals of the Rev. S. Crowther and the Rev. J. C. Taylor. This evidence comes in to support what we long ago received and have long since placed before our readers. It is, too, indisputable evidence; and its importance cannot be overrated, when it is viewed in connexion with the misery into which the cotton-manufacturing districts have been plunged. We know that Government has been asked for a subsidy for carrying mails regularly up the river to Rabba, 400 miles from the sea. There must be a provision made for such conveyance of mails; because we must have a consul at Rabba, and there must be constant and dependable means of communication between England and the missionary establishments on the Niger. All that is asked is the continuance for a few years of aid similar to that given by the Government to the late Mr. Macgregor Laird, the great pioneer of Niger commerce. We hope soon to announce that a company, with resources adequate to the requirements of Niger navigation and trade, has been organised and subsidised by Government. It would be unpardonable, in face of the great calamity in our cotton districts, if a niggardly parsimony should prevent or impede operations so vital to Great Britain, or if the capitalists and people of this country should be lukewarm in the matter. It is of vast importance to millions of their fellow-countrymen that there should be no delay. They have been suffering under a dearth of cotton, and will always be exposed to a similar calamity until the great resources of Western Africa in that important staple are adequately developed. Look at the Rev. Mr. Crowther\'s account of his purchases: 450lbs. of clean cotton, paid for literally by articles costing 4s. 18s. 6½d. One such fact is worth a host of suppositions.

Cotton being indigenous, and the high price of cotton in this country being the cause of half their deficiency of return for their palm oil, there is strong inducement for them to set earnestly about its cultivation. We hope that the British merchants trading to Africa will demand cotton everywhere; that when the natives complain of insufficient return for their oil, the merchants will say, ""Bring us cotton."" It is their duty, and it will be for their interest, to do this. And if this be constantly done, the result cannot fail to be a great increase of cotton production in Africa. The British merchants trading to Africa must turn their attention seriously to cotton, for the decrease in value of tallow proceeds from causes not temporary, but, to all appearance, permanent. And in this strange combination of fluctuations in trade we find the germ of African industrial regeneration. It is just such a combination as was indispensable to overcome the industrial stagnation in Africa—to give a sufficient motive for an increased degree of labour—to raise up a rival to the too facile palm tree in the African mind.\n\n**COTTON!

The Niger and its great tributary, the Chadda, rival the Mississippi in everything but Anglo-Saxon enterprise. Cotton is indigenous; the natives, although undoubtedly they have much to learn even in this, know how to cultivate it. They have produced and sold it, as we showed last month, at about 23d. per pound for clean raw cotton of very good quality, far superior to Surats, and such as nearly every one of our Lancashire mills could work up. The cotton countries begin along the Delta, about 150 miles from the sea. Thence, for 800 miles on the two rivers, there is an open navigation, offering every requisite facility for the cheap transport of produce. The people are inclined to industry—they are beginning to thirst for English goods. And why are not these facilities, good dispositions, and desires made available for the future security of Lancashire? Why? Well, we state unhesitatingly—because the British Government has only done hitherto but a small part of its duty as regards the encouragement of navigation and trade in the Niger. At a period of profuse national expenditure, a few thousand pounds a-year are thought too much to risk for the future security of hundreds of thousands of cotton operatives. Relieved by the spontaneous individual charity of the people from the necessity of furnishing two or three millions sterling for the support of our unemployed countrymen, they content themselves with uttering a few formal phrases about future cotton supply, and leave this, like the feeding of starving men, women, and children, to the community at large to provide for. As a principle, the non-intervention of Government in commercial matters is good. Under ordinary circumstances, it works well too. But no rigid and unelastic system ever yet sufficed for great exceptional and extraordinary national emergencies. And in such an one we find ourselves at present. The Government prints from time to time some reports from it agents and others as regards fields for cotton supply, and there its solicitude for the future seems to end. Like the Lancashire manufacturers, it talks and prints, but does not act. It folds its arms as they do, and seems to wait as they do, in the hope that sooner or later the slave fields of the Southern American States will recommence furnishing a supply of cotton. Untaught by the past, both Government and manufacturers seem as if they would be quite content to depend, as heretofore, on the American Slave States for cotton. ""It is not the duty of a Government to get cotton,"" says a smiling Minister. ""It is no part of a manufacturer\'s duty to provide a supply of cotton,"" says the grumbling manufacturer. We admit this. But this is only half the truth. It is the duty of both, under present exceptional circumstances, to say to those whose ordinary business it would be to obtain a supply, ""We cannot expect you to take all the risk; we will give every possible facility—we will take our share in the venture."" What we ask at the present moment of the Government is little enough—we ask for a Consul at Rabba, on the Niger. It cannot be expected that those who are otherwise inclined to run the risks which necessarily attend the introduction of commerce into new regions, will go 500 miles up an African river for produce, however much the people of this country may want it, without some British protection there. We have heard it said that the duty of Government is to send a Consul where there is already a trade established. Ordinarily it may be so; but in this case we do not hesitate to say that it is their duty, knowing that a large trade could be created there, to send a Consul, in order that such a trade may be created. Strict maxims of political economy, and narrow views of official duty, will not feed a starving population, or revive and secure a languishing and precarious industry. There are especial reasons for Government action, as well as ordinary seasons of Government abstention. The present is one of the former. We can scarcely conceive that an enlightened Government should hesitate where the path of duty is so plain. We hope it will not hesitate. A small annual expenditure, in such a case as this, is true economy. We do not ask for a bounty on Niger cotton; we do not like a trade fostered and encouraged, pampered and misled, by a vicious aiding principle. But what we do ask, under the exceptional circumstances of cotton supply, is, that the Government will do all that may be necessary to induce our enterprising mercantile people to set about a development of the vast cotton and other resources of that great river of Central Africa, the Niger. And first among these is the appointment of a British Consul at Rabba.'}, {'id': 136, 'article_title': 'Cotton Supply', 'full_section_title': 'Cotton Supply', 'last_edit_date': '03-23-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_03_1863', 'content': 'We have seen the question of cotton supply pass through the successive stages of agitation, speculation, doubt, and prophecy, to that of the fulfilment of the fact of a famine of the fibre.

We cast our eyes on Lancashire, and we see no adequate relief in any other way than by a supply of cotton. It is all very well that the nation bears up grandly under the calamity. But the manufacturing operatives must be considered. Voluntary contributions from their fellow-subjects will not continue to feed them. Public works cannot always employ them. It cannot be expected. It ought not to be expected. Many most valuable institutions have been brought to the verge of ruin by the withdrawal of support from them to meet the greater immediate exigencies of last winter's agonising distress in Lancashire. No; the voluntary effort then made cannot be repeated. And shall the nation then look calmly on its financial prosperity, and do nothing to diminish or control the pressure caused by non-employment? Certainly not, if there be any means of Government action available. We must express our opinion that a great responsibility weighs now upon the Government in this matter of an adequate and permanent supply of the requisite cotton to the manufacturers of this country. No one can object more than we do, under all ordinary circumstances, to any factitious aids in production or commerce. But there are exceptional occasions and circumstances, and this is one.

Churchill said the right hon. gentleman had amply shown the necessity for inquiry into the state of affairs on the West Coast of Africa, and he felt, as he was sure the House must feel, great satisfaction that the right hon. gentleman had redeemed so early in the session the pledge he gave last year. (Hear, hear.) The unfortunate Ashantee war, which last year was the cause of so much pain in the House, was of itself sufficient ground for a committee, but there were other reasons why an inquiry should be now undertaken. The state of affairs on the West Coast of Africa was now, and had been for a considerable period, most unsatisfactory. Without any intention to prejudice the present occupiers of the Colonial-office, he must say that Africa had been the bête noir of the department. The unhealthiness of the climate and various other causes of that nature had militated in a great measure against the full development of the resources of the country immediately bordering upon the British settlements. Cape Coast Castle was one of the oldest, if not the oldest British settlement. It was instituted about 150 years ago, when England was a slaveholding power, for the purpose of enabling us to procure slaves to send to our settlements in America. It had been computed that before the slave-trade was done away with, we exported 590,000 slaves from the African coast to America, and we had thus incurred an enormous responsibility, which, as a Christian country, we were bound to make good in some way to that unfortunate people. Therefore the idea of giving up any of the settlements on the Coast would not, he thought, find favour in England, and he did not understand the mover of the committee to make any such suggestion. All he understood the right hon. gentleman to say was, that the present method of Government required inquiry, and that we must either increase our responsibilities by occupying and forming a colony of the protected territory, or we must reduce our responsibilities by limiting the area over which we now professed to exercise protection. The climate, the right hon. gentleman had stated, was notoriously unfit for the Anglo-Saxon race, and that was the reason why more had not been done there. It had been difficult to get men of a superior class to undertake the charge of government on that Coast, but he believed it would be quite possible to locate the Government officers on higher grounds. The same objection was made to Jamaica and our West Indian colonies till it was found out by going to the top of the hills the amount of sickness was very much reduced, and on the West Coast of Africa there were very high hills indeed, where a climate might be found in which the health of Englishmen would not suffer at all. We had been at a charge of 1,000,000l. to support the slave squadron; but he concurred with the right hon. gentleman that where there was a demand there would always eventually be found a supply. He thought it quite possible that England might be induced to make the protected territory into a colony which would be self-supporting, whereas at present we exercised little or no control over the native chiefs, and had done nothing by education beyond the voluntary efforts of missionaries, or by making roads for their cultivation. He did not mean to say that he was prepared to adopt that view at once, but inquiry might be made in that direction. There were others who thought it much better that we should give up the whole of the protected territories, and simply retain the forts as places where there might be stationed small executive governments and a few soldiers; but he did not think if we simply did that we should be exercising the same control over the slave-trade that we did now; whereas, if we made a colony of the protected territory, he believed the development of cotton, the growth of coffee and other things, would be brought into competition with the slave-grown produce of other countries, and would tend to reduce the value of slave labour. (Hear, hear.) So fully alive were the natives of Cape Coast Castle to the inquiry about to be instituted, that they had subscribed large sums for the purpose of sending over here witnesses of their own to place their case clearly before the committee. They would also have evidence from the Basle Missionary Society, whose exertions in behalf of the Africans he was glad to bear testimony to, especially in instruction in useful occupations, by means of which they were leading the natives much more willingly than societies which confined their operations to religious instruction would be able to do. It was unfortunate that in Gambia trade had been falling off. While the number of English vessels had considerably diminished, there had been a corresponding increase among the French. He thought it was a fit subject of inquiry as to whether our system of government had or had not in any way suppressed the energy of our merchants in trading to that country. There was no doubt we had on the Coast of Africa enormous resources, capable of supplying this country with raw material for our manufactures. He believed that last year we imported to England from Cape Coast Castle fifty tons of cotton of a superior kind. Therefore, by giving fair and proper encouragement to the trade, we should no doubt enable them to produce this superior article to enter into competition with slave-grown cotton. He could only further express a hope that the inquiry would lead to great results for the moral improvement of that part of Africa.

At the first glance it may be thought by the owners of steam and sailing ships trading with Africa that we are premature in mooting the subject of a reduction in the rates of freight on cotton. It may be urged by them that these rates have undergone a reduction of 50 per cent., and their first impulse will no doubt be to say that it is preposterous to expect they can be still further reduced. It is true, thanks to the British and African Steam Navigation Company, that the rate of freight on cotton is now 3d. per pound instead of 1¼d. per pound, as it was in the days of steam monopoly by the African Steamship Company; but, at the same time, it is equally true that the rate of 3d. per pound is still too high a rate for the products of an industry that needs to be nursed and encouraged, and is consequently an impediment to that increase in the growth of cotton in West Africa which is so desirable for the progress of the African countries and the interests of Great Britain. Only those who, thirsting for African advancement, were watching the onward march of African agricultural industry, were sensible of the great impediment to the cotton culture which 1¼d. per pound freight on cotton to England placed in its way. It was a grievous error of the African Steamship Company to impose such a freight on cotton. The earliest efforts made in cotton culture for exportation, under the munificent donation of Miss Burdett Coutts so ably applied by Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester, had established that cotton might be made in the course of time to figure largely in the exports of West Africa; that soil and climate favoured its growth, and that the natives in certain districts were willing to cultivate it for foreign markets. But 1¼d. per pound freight to Liverpool was a frightful obstacle, and the rate of progress was very slow until the disastrous civil war in America raised the price of New Orleans cotton from 5d. to above 2s. per pound. The African cotton from the Egba Countries is not much inferior to the New Orleans; it therefore approximated in value to the latter in the British markets, and the high price gave a stimulus to the African cotton industry which enabled it to triumph over the 1¼d. obstacle. Prices receded after the termination of the American war, but until lately they have been such as still to allow the production in Africa to progress, notwithstanding the 1¼d. and, later, as at present, 3d. freight. But the joint influence, temporarily of the European war, and, we believe permanently, of increased production in the United States, with the opening of new facilities of supply from India to England, via the Suez Canal, has caused a rapid fall in prices during the last few months, a fall which seems to point unmistakeably to prices somewhat similar to those which ruled immediately before the American struggle. We do not hesitate to say that this change of circumstance necessitates a change of rate of freight on cotton from Africa to England—necessitates it both in the interests of Africa and of the steam companies themselves. We are convinced that in what we are about to ask we are consulting their best interests. The interests of conveyers of produce from the Coast cannot be dissociated from those of the producers and traders. The African Steam Company did not see this heretofore; monopoly often creates blindness; but better counsels now prevail, a clearer sight has now been given, and we expect to see the now friendly rivals, the two great Steamship Companies, carefully watching the rise of any new agricultural industry in the African countries, and fostering and giving impetus to it by low rates of freight for the new product in the infancy of production. There are only three of the West African exports that depend entirely on what may be strictly called agricultural industry. These are ground-nuts, ginger, and cotton. The first of these has already established itself as a great staple, and may therefore be placed, more or less, although it has now a growing competition with the East Indies and other countries, in the same category with the grand staple, palm-oil, which may be left to take care of itself without any fear of prejudice thereby resulting to it. But cotton requires, demands, the nursing care of the shipowners. It has not, like palm-oil, a monopoly in European markets; it has to struggle against the organised production in America, the East Indies, Egypt, and other countries where a large capital and great facilities of transit, together with all the economising appliances which large capital only can command, give it great advantages. Under these circumstances it is to the interest, as we have before said, of this country, of the steam companies, and of Africa, that it should be treated with exceptional tenderness. And as the African advocate and guardian we earnestly ask this of them. We want to see this cotton industry so important to Great Britain, greatly and rapidly developed in the Egba, Yoruba, and Volta Countries. The latter, whenever a permanent pacification takes place, by the country becoming secured against Ashantee inroads, may be made a large cotton producer. Mr. J. C. Brandt, and one or two other Accra men, gave the first impulse, we believe, in Krepee, during the American war, and the German missionary traders followed profitably in the same path. The Ashantee invasion has for a time greatly impaired this industry, but there is every reason why, with so industrious a people as the Krepees, and good soil and climate, there should be a large exportation via the River Volta from Krepee, if the Steam Companies act on our suggestion. And we are not asking them to make any great present sacrifice to their own future and Africa's permanent interests. We are not going to ask them to bring cotton from Lagos or the Volta or Accra, to Liverpool, at freights lower than the average paid for cotton of other countries to that port. American cotton pays 7-16ths per pound freight by steamers from New York, or 3-16ths per pound by fast-sailing ships; African, even at the now reduced rates, pays 3d. per pound freight equally by the steamships and by those, for the most part, tubs of sailing ships, which manage to take three or four months, at best, to make the voyage. We are only asking them to do what is just and reasonable, and what will be to their own advantage in the long run.""}, {'id': 2612, 'article_title': 'ASHANTI WAR PREPARATIONS', 'full_section_title': 'ASHANTI WAR PREPARATIONS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_11_1873#article-5', 'issue_date': '29_11_1873', 'content': '**November 11.**—American beef not being found good enough, Government is salting its own at Deptford at the rate of 70,000 lbs. per week.

In the various places to which he went Sir B. Griffith collected around him native chiefs and merchants, in order to hear from themselves their views and wishes. At Pram Pram, the King, an old man, wanted nothing save to be allowed to revive an old custom, part of which consisted in the exhumation of the dead. At Quetta the chiefs and people said they had nothing to say about the state of the district of his Excellency, but they did desire that the duty on spirits, which had been lowered experimentally from 2s. 6d. to 1s. a gallon, might be lowered still further to 6d. a gallon; they were glad that the *ad valorem* duties were abolished, and complained that traders were molested on one of the roads. The Governor told them he was determined to stop the smuggling of rum, and advised them to cultivate cotton. The desired remission in duty on spirits appears to have been refused. The Afflowho chiefs were also warned against smuggling, and told the great advantages of growing cotton. At Big Awoonah the chief sent a friendly message, which the Governor acknowledged with a present of half a sovereign and two bottles of champagne. At Addah there was an important meeting; the people there wanted a road to the beach, a school, stipends to the chiefs, the reduction of the duty on rum to 1s. a gallon, wells, a public bell to mark the time, a free ferry across the Volta River, and a warehouse on the beach. To these the Governor replied that he would help them to make the road, but they must help themselves; that he could not see why they wanted a school, seeing that they had already two, of which they did not avail themselves; he could not promise them stipends or reduce the rum duty; they would have their bell, and would be shown how to sink wells; the ferry would be considered, and they could not want a warehouse on the beach. Here, again, smuggling and cotton came up as before. On the following day the chiefs expressed a wish to have another interview with the Governor. They pressed him to reduce the rum duty, and to give them stipends; but after a lengthy discussion the Governor succeeded in sending them away in good humour; but without cheaper rum or the stipends. They did not press him a second time on the school question. At Odumassie the King received the Governor in great state, and, in return, the latter impressed upon his Majesty, his chiefs, and women the importance of cotton, and the advantages of the Basle missionaries. The King begged for a pair of handcuffs to enforce his powers, and a lamp; King Akrobato, whose capital is two hours’ journey from that of the King of Odumassie, also wanted a lamp and handcuffs. At Akropong the King and chiefs gave the Governor the most imposing reception he had had. ""I expatiated as usual upon cotton and cocoa cultivation."" The King said that the cocoa plants the Governor had sent him had all failed; he and his chiefs were anxious to know how they could recover debts due to them, and they also wanted to be paid in cash in place of gin for palm oil. On the whole the situation appears to be this—the Government want the people to grow cotton, cocoa, and coffee, so that they may not be wholly dependent on palm oil; to go to school, not to molest travellers, not to smuggle, and to keep the roads and wells in order. The people do not appear to care about any of these things.'}, {'id': 5931, 'article_title': 'COMMERCIAL INTERESTS IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'COMMERCIAL INTERESTS IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'issue_date': '02_12_1889', 'content': '\n\nGovernor Moloney, in his address, said that in these days of severe international competition it would seem to be a duty specially incumbent on us to consider how we could best serve the interests of those countries on which we depended to get rid of our surplus manufactures and for the raw materials. It had occurred to him that he would best serve British interests, so far as they were connected with Negroland, by submitting for their hearing some remarks on the cotton interests of Yoruba and Western Africa, and on the currency of the Gambia, and on the repatriation from the new world of the Negro to promote on any permanent and extensive basis the development of his own country, and through him British interests. The population of Yoruba was given as 3,000,000, its area at 25,000 to 30,000 square miles, and it might be compared in size to Belgium and Holland. Over it we had for years directed from Lagos our influence. Our relations with it had now been placed beyond dispute or foreign interference by treaties. The colony of Lagos, which was the seaboard of Yoruba, was acquired in August 1861 and July 1863. The treaties conveyed to her Majesty the whole territories of the cedents. Later additions were made at the wish of the native authorities concerned as follow: Kingdom of Patama in 1879, of Appa in 1863, and of Matino, Jakri, and of Lobo in 1885. An important and extensive cotton native industry proceeded along West Africa in the Volof, Mandingo, Tchi, Ewe, and Yoruba countries—but the export of the raw product gave no idea of the industry. When we remembered the millions of cloths turned out annually for their home consumption, of which little was generally known, we must recognise the industry of the natives in this one growth alone, and consider whether Lancashire could not replace this industry, and thus let loose the native energy for extended agricultural pursuits, of such moment to that continent. We found that the imports into the United Kingdom of raw cotton, for the last five years, were a bagatelle compared with what they might be; and when we remembered that cotton grew luxuriantly in Tropical Africa, the low prices realised and its inferior quality had kept the natives from cotton cultivation beyond their own requirements. The Yoruba or Lagos cotton was brownish in colour, rough, and short in staple, and consequently did not command the higher prices of the market. The cotton of the Portuguese possessions—to wit Angola—was white, silky, and of good length in staple, and when properly cleaned and prepared is as valuable as American. To improve our export the Government of Lagos had introduced into the country, several species of the cotton-yielding genus. The short staple of the Yoruba cotton had told much against its marketable value. The introduction of this special seed would result in the growth of a more valuable commodity, and enable the negroes to compete on even terms with other countries. Against such imports from West Africa we must place the cotton imports thereto in a manufactured form; and must bear in mind that the largest supply of the raw commodity reached this country from the United States, from plantations dependent on negroes, whose growth and future utilisation become a question of considerable importance. Why could not negroes at home do likewise for their own country? And thus, why could not we help our colonies and the mother country to be self-supplying and supporting? Manufactured cotton goods exported from this country to West Africa took the form of piece goods, plain and printed, twist and yarn, thread, &c. In connexion with what was known as the pagn currency, he invited attention to the native manufacture, on the river Gambia, of cotton cloths, generally known as pagn. Women wore each two m\'pendal and sevre, the former for the lower, the latter for the upper part of the body. In addition to a loin cloth, the men used each one pagn (taray-laye). These pagns serve additionally as did our bed clothes. The importance of this cotton growth should be well weighed by such an industrial centre as Manchester. In addition to their costume requirements, Gambians manufactured a sufficiency for an extensive native currency, known as the local pagn currency. This stock represented the output of the spare time of negresses and their slaves, and was regulated by the fact that their wealth was invested chiefly in slaves and cloths, which went largely to represent their capital. Wearing cloths fetched sometimes as much as £20 each. Pagns were sold by length and not by weight. They were unsized, substantial, and of great durability—conditions that should weigh with home manufacturers if they aimed at replacing this native industry, and thus setting free for other agricultural work the hands employed now as weavers. In East Africa the natives of Zanzibar bought mainly ""Merikani"" cloth, leaving the inferior English goods to the Arabs, who traded with the interior. His fear was that this should affect to a serious extent the sale of our goods in the markets of the interior of Africa. The result would be that the African would cease to buy European goods, and would begin once more to manufacture his own grass and cotton cloths, which even now were in great demand among the natives of the coast, in consequence of the greater liberty of access now enjoyed to the interior and less distant markets. Country cloths were now exposed for sale in every marketplace beside the European goods, and were not unlikely to beat them out of the markets near the coast. Instead of educating the native up to a sense of appreciation of the variation of European tariffs, he had been deceived by quality, short lengths, strengths, weights and measures. The trade used to deal in pieces of so many yards made up of so many yard-folds. The native went by weight and folds. What did he know of our standard—that 36 inches go to a yard? Well, there was introduced the practice of importing finished pieces made up into the same number of folds as before, but having each fold some inches short of thirty-six. Retail hucksters had felt obliged to continue the deception by the use of so-called yard measures of so many inches less than the standard measure—32 inches being the now accepted standard yard in many of the native markets. They knew that the Niger had been the high road of Mahometanism from North and East Africa. Its active pioneers and advance guard on Yoruba had been the Peuls or Falanis, who had overrun and subjected most of the country in the middle stream, and had succeeded in contracting the area of Yorubaland. Islamism grew apace in West Africa, and with it a demand for Manchester cotton, when it was remembered that each person who dressed after Mahometan fashion had two or three complete costumes each year, and that one costume took from 40 to 50 yards of croydon where cloth of native manufacture was not used. In Yoruba the dress of an ordinary male Mahometan consisted of trousers, vest, gown, cap, and turban; and takes from 45 to 50 yards per suit, of which he was said to have two or three each year. The lady\'s costume consisted of a cloth, cover cloth, head tie, and ashion covering, and takes about 33 yards. With an allowance of three suits in each case per annum, of croydon material, we would have a consumption of 250 yards for a male and female couple, or 125 yards per person, which at 4s. per 25 yards would equal £1 a head. Now the population of Yoruba is given at 3,000,000. and the trade routes via Busah and Rabba connect them with the Mahometan states of Lunking, the Middle and Upper Niger, and therefore the cotton demand was trivial compared with what it may become. He noticed, in the Church Mission Atlas there were in Africa 50,416,000 Mahometans, and 14,472,900 pagans, so they must acknowledge the enormity of the work Lancashire would have if they succeed only in securing a continuance of cotton export. In view of the emancipation of slaves in Brazil and the desire of many of them to return to their fatherland country of the Yorubas, it had occurred to him that a statement of the advantages thus to be derived might induce those who were interested in the advancement of the negro to establish steam communication between Lagos and Brazil. Experience of the industry of such settlers in the past showed that the prosperity of the country would be increased by this work of repatriation. An extended influx of skilled agriculturists, craftsmen, and mechanics could not fail to improve the general prospects of the land of the Yorubas and of West Africa generally. Besides the advantages to be derived from an immigration of intelligent settlers into our colonies and our neighbouring kingdoms, a study of the intercontinental trade between Brazil and Lagos during the six years ended with 1887 led to the conclusion that there was every prospect of a successful issue to an attempt to encourage the repatriation of the lately liberated Africans. Upon examination of the trade carried on by the sailing vessels on this route, it appeared more than likely that several of the articles dealt in would become considerable factors in the trade.'}, {'id': 6750, 'article_title': 'THE POSITION IN EQUATORIAL AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE POSITION IN EQUATORIAL AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1896#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_05_1896', 'content': ""The geographical and strategical position of the Bahr-el-Ghazal province with reference to the rest of the Sudan renders its possession of the greatest importance.

The greater part of these nuts, probably three-fourths, are exported to France, where they are converted into an oil which is sold as olive oil, and is largely used for domestic purposes.\n\nThe recent falling off in the ground-nut crop has led the merchants to direct their attention to cotton, and steps are being taken to induce the natives to adopt its cultivation, fifteen tons and a half having been exported in 1864.\n\nThe policy of this measure appears doubtful: there is no diminution in the demand for ground-nuts, nor any reason to suppose that they will cease to be in request, so long as oil continues so extensively an article of continental consumption; it is difficult to prevail on the natives to change their habits or customs, and, even if successful in the present instance, it must be a long time before the cotton crop can rival in value even the ground-nut crop of the past year. It is also to be feared that the cultivation of cotton, requiring attention during a considerable portion of the year, and being necessarily carried on in the same spot, will be unsuited to the habits of the wandering tribes engaged in growing the ground-nut, a cultivation which only requires their absence from home during four months of the year, and which they can carry on wherever they please on paying a percentage for the use of the land.\n\nMoreover, a cotton plantation is liable to destruction at any time when war may break out in its neighbourhood, whilst ground-nuts are exposed to this very common danger during only one-third of the year.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Operations of the British East Africa Company', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The products of the Kesmayu and Juba rivers district are detailed with the prices in the London market: These are—ivory, indiarubber, maize, millet, simsim, orchella weed, hides, rice.

In the Upper Juba rubies and emeralds are obtainable, and gold is reported at Bardera. But, putting all conjectural treasure aside, over all the coast regions, and up the Sabaki river, there is ample scope for plantation work.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of Tropical Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. H. H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products. By-and-by, when they are taught, they will begin to cultivate the soil and raise products which are in demand in Europe. Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world. The chartered companies meanwhile will, no doubt, do fairly well, not making great returns, but sufficient to repay their shareholders for their investment, while developing and creating a great country and a large market for our manufactures. As to the demand for\n\nour goods, that is a question that need not trouble us. The natives are fully alive to the advantage of British manufactures, and they will take any amount.

Colonel Paris presided, and there was a large attendance of members and others interested. Commander Cameron, who, on rising, was loudly applauded, said: What he wished to speak about was the commerce of Africa, and what would come out of the Berlin Conference, and other events which were now happening; for the Conference could not fail to be of great importance to British trade. Tropical Africa, except in a few cases, on the shores of great water-ways, was scarcely known. From the interior the difficulties of transport prevented any profit except on the most valuable products. The first idea of the trader seemed ivory. India-rubber was coming into use, and before he left the West Coast over £20,000 worth had been exported from Zanzibar in one year. Many valuable gums and spices were found in Central Africa. Africa was to all appearance, until a few years ago, the happy hunting ground of Englishmen; it was only those who voyaged who could really compete with us. Now all these things were changed, and on every side they saw a scramble for Africa. It was our duty to know as much as possible about the resources of this continent, and how the future of Africa was to be controlled by the Congo Free State, which promised to be the outcome of the Berlin Conference. Very great results were to be expected, and he might mention that, north-east of Victoria Nyanza, there was a plateau which might be colonized by Europeans, and whence trade might be put into some of the great producing centres of Africa. The trade of the Arab at Zanzibar was carried out by a system of advance. On the west coast there was a trade carried on by a few Europeans. In the last century the Portuguese had an enormous trade up the Zambesi, and in Zumbo Town there were the ruins of a cathedral and a university which had at one time 370 students. There were two other towns of equal importance. The great difficulty in this trade was the climate. At a conference in Brussels in 1876, the idea of an International Association was sketched, and the King of the Belgians had set himself steadfastly to work to further this great idea of promoting the civilization of the ""Dark Continent."" Nearly all the people of Africa were traders; the cultivation of the soil was relegated to the women. At Nyanza there were enormous assemblies of people, some of whom came to market 15 or 20 miles, travelling against the current of the Congo. From this locality he had brought home nutmegs that were of the greatest use in commerce. From the same region there came wild coffee. There were enormous districts where any amount of rice could be grown; you had only to ""scratch the earth,"" and it smiled at you. At some of these interior stations whole caravans were supplied by small villages with wheat sufficient for a week\'s journey. The people of those villages were able to produce for from ten to twelve times their number with scarcely any labour. On the Niger we had utilized water traffic, and the Congo had a number of miles of water carriage which could be utilized. There was, at the same time, the great difficulty of getting from the coast to this system on the Congo. Various schemes had been proposed to connect Stanley Pool with the Congo by railway, and he believed that after the settlement of the dispute between France and the International Association, the French would construct a railway to Stanley Pool, or the Association from the left bank of the Congo, and they would then be able to have instant communication with the centre of Africa. Further south, the Portuguese were beginning to wake up to the value of their territories. They were now making contracts to construct a railway into the interior. It was their duty as Englishmen to look after that scheme. The region he was speaking of produced ivory, gum, cotton, and spices. The Powers at the Berlin Conference had recognized the International Association as practically a sovereign State. What they must strongly insist upon was free trade, and permission to reside and trade in the Free State. Another point was as to the mode in which future annexations were to be made. Annexations had been going on rather fast lately, and the Conference agreement was to the effect that when a place was annexed notice was to be sent to the other countries, and that people trading at such a place were to continue trading under the same guarantees as formerly. He fancied that would be simply that there might be equal rights to all nations, and people already trading in places which had no European sovereign might find their positions injured by annexation on the part of European Powers. In this matter, also, he thought that great care had to be exercised. Then they had to think of the great trade which used to pass down Egypt from the Upper Nile. The Suakin and Berber Railway was contracted for at one time by Ismail Pasha, but he was compelled to give up the idea. If that railway had been built, we should have had none of the difficulties in the Soudan which we had at present. He mentioned as a sign of the times that an Ambassador from Timbuctoo was at Paris treating with the President of the French Republic. We had the trade of the Lower Niger in our hands, but in the Upper Niger a great portion of the trade might be diverted from us if the proposed railway were completed. There was one thing which he must say, and that was that if we wanted outlets for our goods we must send proper and suitable goods for the people. The establishment of the Congo Free State would prove a benefit to English trade, but we must watch the constitution of that State, and, if there were any objectionable features in it, get them removed. In conclusion, Commander Cameron remarked that in a very large portion of Africa cotton of very good quality grew. He had specimens at home of cotton goods which had been made by the natives in the interior, and he believed that, as communication improved they would see cargoes of cotton coming to Liverpool from Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Cotton Growing in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the course of a letter appearing in a recent issue of the *Manchester Examiner & Times*, the writer throws out a very valuable suggestion: ""That, in the interests of the native races of Africa (and of Lancashire), something might be done by other methods than the selfishness displayed in the scramble for African territory. The present condition of the cotton trade must make all who are engaged in it wish for some other method than a resort to short time every year. I would ask whether it is possible to found a company for encouraging the growth of cotton in Africa by the natives in territory not dominated by Europeans; or where the domination is of such a sort that, whenever the natives are consolidated enough, they might be left to govern themselves.

These farmers, we must inform your lordship, are principally natives from the interior, who, in consequence of there being no roads for the conveyance of such bulky produce, come down to the banks of the river to cultivate, and remain three or four years; at the end of that period they generally return to their own country with their earnings.\n\nThese factories in the river are in charge of native traders (our servants), men without any capital of their own, and the system of the trade is such that they are obliged to keep current accounts with the farmers and others engaged in collecting the produce running over several years, and we are firmly convinced that we shall lose not only the amount of the actual debts which may be owing to us at these factories, but that the natives from their experience of the French rule in the Senegal and the Cazamanze, will retire from the banks of the river, and it will take years to restore confidence and the trade to its present state.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-07-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agriculture on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In a very interesting report on economic agriculture on the Gold Coast, issued from the Colonial Office, some noteworthy information relating to the cultivation of cotton in that part of West Africa is included.

This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture. The enormous number of silk-cotton trees in the colony would yield a plentiful supply if the people found it worth collecting and exporting, and the timber is used for making fishing canoes.\n\nRice also might be made an important crop on the Gold Coast.

While there are tracts in the interior, where Europeans could lead happy and healthy lives, the west in general is a land of negroes. The mass of the population must always be of the negro race. Through the use of proper means Mr. Johnston is convinced the native race can be civilised and rendered industrious to a very satisfactory extent. Mr. Johnston's theory is that England should enlarge its borders to the utmost. British trade is the lever he proposes for the enlightenment of the black race. The more the territory which is acquired the more can that influence be exerted. With British trade the appliances of European civilisation are bound to advance.\n\nThey will fast educate the negro both morally and intellectually. Only a condition is that the sway of the Queen's sceptre be acknowledged. Without that there will be no opening for British trade, or for the advantages which follow in its train.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods.

The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'As an eminent economist has pointed out, \'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically. Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

In Kenya, by 1927, between 83700 and 117 000 Africans, or more than 50% of total wage labour, worked in commercial agriculture. The leading crops were maize, coffee, wheat and sisal. Maize occupied only 325 ha in 1905; by 1920 it occupied nearly 12500 ha, and nine years later the area had risen to over 90000 ha.$^{43}$ By the early 1920s the settlers had ousted African peasants from the production and trade of this important staple.

In 1913, the exclusive African sector contributed 24% of the value of total domestic exports while the exclusive European sector contributed only 5%.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism varied from area to area and from theme to theme. There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel.

In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary.

The island of Zanzibar was incorporated into the world- economy via its dominant role in the world market for cloves by the mid-nineteenth century, which involved the establishment of a plantation system.$^{32}$ Sugar plantations were created on Mauritius, and Madagascar developed rice and beef production for export to Mauritius.$^{33}$ It was, however, the Scramble for Africa which later spilled over into eastern Africa and precipitated the kind of change of which it was the result elsewhere in Africa.\nThe transformation of production structures could not have occurred in isolation from a transformation of the political structures that facilitated the economic changes and sought to legitimize them. But what precisely was the link? I. Hrbek remarked some time ago on the importance of the years 1805-20 in African history. He observed the simultaneity of the following events: the Western Sudanese djihad of \'Uthman dan Fodio (Usman dan Fodio) (and other Islamic revolutions), the rise of the Zulu under Shaka, the eclipse of Bunyoro and the rise of Buganda in the interlacustrine region, the Fulbe (Fulani, Peul) revolutions in the Western Sudan, the modernizing regime of Muhammad \'AIT in Egypt, the unification of the Imerina on Madagascar under Radama I, and the rise of Omani hegemony under Sayyid Said. He observed that \'all these processes were going on in ""contact"" zones and were due to some extent to external impact and influence.\' 34', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': ""It is important not to exaggerate the extent of European power in Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century, or the rate at which Europeans acquired 'possessions' or penetrated inland before 1850. The Portuguese made extensive claims both in Angola and in Mozambique. They had established military outposts and prazos (agricultural estates) in the interior, and from time to time they controlled the area from Loje, south of Cuanza, as far east as Kassanje, apart from trading posts on the coast between Ambriz and Moçâmedes. In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials. The increased demand for slaves in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century had shifted attention from the prazo system, and the security of the trade routes depended more on the pombeiros (barefoot mulatto merchants), bearing Brazilian trade-goods and surviving only on the good will of African rulers and merchants.$^{10}$ The French had revived their trading posts in Senegambia after 1815, notably Saint-Louis and GorØe. Their venture to establish an agricultural farm in Waalo with a military post in Bakel to protect it had been a failure. In North Africa, they seized Algiers in 1830. They spent the next twenty years overcoming the resistance of the Algerians, notably the movement led by Amir 'Abd al-Kädir. The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture. With the increasing prosperity and expansion of the Creoles to Bathurst (now Banjul), Badagry, Lagos and beyond, British commercial and missionary influence was spreading along the coast and at one or two points like Abeokuta began to penetrate into the interior around 1850. On the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the British still shared the trade with the Danes and the Dutch, and took measures to resist Asante (Ashanti) efforts to dominate the coast, notably by exploiting the Fante fear of Asante domination and encouraging the Fante to act together under British tutelage.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

One result of this has been that Africa—uncivilized, undeveloped Africa—has grown into estimation in quarters where the possibility of any good thing coming out of it was formerly regarded as the mere day-dreams of peculiar enthusiasts. The breath of life seems to have been breathed upon the dry bones of African enterprise; we hear on every hand of embryo projects—many of them, it is true, very vague and wild, but others that only require, for successful realization, a renewed application of those means and energies which in other time led to the foundation of our Indian Empire, and which, in the very teeth of Government indifference, and quasi, when not active and open, opposition, dotted the face of the earth with colonies, now our pride and glory; and even the Secretary of State for the Colonies has pointed to Central Africa as holding in reserve a wondrous wealth for British merchants and manufacturers.

They stand waiting for Jupiter to drag their cart out of the heavy mire, instead of putting their own shoulders vigorously to the wheels for its extrication. Every day of such miscalculating apathy involves a waste of resources. Protective tariffs are bristling against them on every hand. China, which has as abundant coal resources as they have, and a teeming population of cheap and dexterous labourers eager for employment, is importing that machinery which has been the foundation of their former unexampled prosperity. Our own large European-peopled colonies are entering the lists against them, endeavouring themselves to supply their own domestic wants, under the ægis of protective import duties. Impoverished India, with a population akin to that of China, is yearly extending its manufacturing operations, almost excluding certain qualities of British cottons from its markets; while it and our colonies are open to our home-protected European and American competitors for the introduction, upon the same terms with our own, of their surplus of production, which, in consequence of the higher prices they obtain in their home markets, they can afford to dispose of there at unremunerating rates. It is quite true that at the present moment there is renewed activity in some departments of British industry, consequent upon the increased demands from the United States of America, which, owing to their yearly increasing heavy balances against Europe, arising from their wondrous supply of food to its rapidly augmenting populations, are recovering from that depression which for a time afflicted them equally with ourselves. But is this renewed activity in some classes of British productions likely to be a permanent one? To a reflective mind this must appear to be exceedingly doubtful. The renewed activity has arisen chiefly from the temporary demand for railway iron and steel, for the reconstruction of existing, and especially for the construction of new, railways, intended to facilitate the transport of wheat and other articles of food to the ports of shipment for Europe, and more especially for Great Britain, from a yearly extending area of production. This may be comforting to the craving population of the British Isles, but will it not rather tend to increase the yearly balance against them, and by a constant drain of national wealth, with consequent impoverishment, decrease a remunerating demand for home productions? To our mental vision there are heavy clouds massing on our industrial horizon, the threatening storms from which can only be averted by energetic action on the part of Government and the possessors of capital, for extending the area of demand for the productions of British manufacturing industry. Our capitalists have received heavy blows, and are experiencing great discouragement from having loaned hundreds of millions of pounds sterling to impecunious and bankrupt foreign States; but the evils resulting from such loss of money will be aggravated tenfold by the miscalculating apathy it has engendered, should that apathy be prolonged. New sources of wealth must be opened, to meet the yearly increasing drain for supplies of food. These sources can only be opened by bold and judicious enterprise. In our projected railways in and from the Gold Coast territories, we have indicated some of these sources. Other European countries are pressing into other parts of the great African continent, where for many, many long years to come there will be no competing manufacturing industries, but only supplies of minerals and vegetable and other produce from rich tropical lands and forests, to be given in exchange for articles made in our looms and workshops. Every day's impediment in the way of these projected railways, whether caused by blind red-tapeism or torpor of capital, is a day of national loss. There is an El Dorado in the wondrously rich Wassaw gold fields, that the construction of the Chamah-Wassaw Railway would throw fully open to the enterprise of Great Britain, with results similar to and perhaps exceeding, those obtained in our Australian colonies, or those to which the flourishing San Francisco owes its origin; while the other projected lines would open up other portions of the Gold Coast territories, and the prolific interior, to a greatly extended and most profitable commerce. When will a sleepy Government awake to a full sense of the national needs, and rouse up dormant capital to beneficial action? We feel that the time is at hand, but we desire to hasten it; nor can we allow ourselves any rest until that which our reason approves, and that which stimulates our hopes, shall become confirmed realities.""}, {'id': 4563, 'article_title': 'Gold Coast Mining Company', 'full_section_title': 'Gold Coast Mining Company', 'last_edit_date': '01-25-1883', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1883#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_02_1883', 'content': 'The ordinary general meeting of shareholders in this company was held at the Guildhall Tavern on January 25; Captain Molesworth, R.N., in the chair.\n\nThe Secretary (Mr. James Ker) read the notice convening the meeting, and the report was taken as read.\n\nThe Chairman said: It is a great satisfaction to the directors to meet the shareholders on this occasion to give an account of their stewardship.

On the contrary, everything seems to point not only to its continuance at the same rate of speed, but also to its acceleration. There is a constant increase of the old elements, and new elements are coming into play. As education progresses among the natives on the Coast, the number of enterprising native traders increases. These are continually extending the area of interior trade, seeking out produce to be purchased by goods imported from Europe. A great and extensive progression may be safely calculated upon from this element alone. But there is another and a most influential one lately added. Gold mining by organized European Companies, although now in its infancy, has already employed a considerable amount of steamship freight and passenger accommodation. What has been derived hitherto, however, by the Steamship Companies from this new element is but a drop in the bucket to what will flow to them, and to this new competitor, the Anglo-African Steam Navigation Company, through the operations of this new element of organized gold mining. This new element alone would amply justify the creation of a new Steamship Company, especially of one that contemplates sailings from London as well as from Liverpool, and, we presume, chiefly from the former. We never supposed that Liverpool would be allowed to retain for ever a monopoly of the carrying trade with West Africa, although London has been strangely supine in the matter. The old Companies have of late years wisely included Germany and France within the limits of their operations, and we are glad to see that the new one whose prospectus we publish has its eye upon Hamburgh, because we feel convinced that it is only by British Companies affording increased facilities to German trade with the West Coast and the South-west Coast, that the German mercantile interest will remain content, and refrain from starting a Steamship Company of their own. We feel quite sure, therefore, that there is ample room for the Anglo-African Steam Navigation Company, When two or three of the now existing and working Gold Mine Companies shall have paid, which they will soon do, very large dividends, the tide of gold mining enterprise will flow rapidly and continuously into those wondrously rich and extensive gold fields from which native industry, totally unaided by machinery or the employment of quicksilver, have, since the discovery of the Gold Coast countries by the Portuguese, supplied Europe with not less than eight hundred million pounds sterling value of gold. If the surface sand, the beds of streams, and a mere superficial scratching of the country have afforded such results, what may not be expected from an extensive employment of all the media of gold extraction and reduction with which science has now stepped in to aid the gold miner? Gold mining will introduce railways; railways will increase the area of production for palm-oil, kernels, India-rubber, gums, and a number of other tropical productions; and so far from the Anglo-African Steam Navigation Company being an excess, we venture to express the hope and belief that, if well managed, it has before it a career of great success, without the pre-existing Companies suffering in any way by its operations. Our friends on the West Coast of Africa who are so deeply interested in the increase of facilities for trade and for passenger traffic, will, of course, be delighted at the advent of a new Steamship Company, and give it all the support in their power. Very many of them remember the period of the one steamer per month, and will not fail to rejoice at the wonderful development of the trade and commerce of so long despised Africa.'}, {'id': 5091, 'article_title': 'THE FUTURE OF THE CONGO FREE STATE', 'full_section_title': 'THE FUTURE OF THE CONGO FREE STATE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_05_1885', 'content': ""M.

Human interest, resting in Europe upon the strong fulcrum of human wants, is the mighty lever that God has clearly ordained for lifting the great continent of Africa to the position she has been endowed for. She has passed rapidly, though it may seem to have been slowly, through the earlier stages of her elevation. The epoch of more potent effort has now arrived. Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it. Just as powerful European organizations prosecuted the slave-trade in Africa which individual cupidity desultorily commenced, and thus gave to that accursed traffic the enormous development to which it attained, so will powerful European organizations now take the field in giving development to that legitimate commerce for which Africa possesses so many rich and copious elements. A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array. Companies with too restricted capital can only do the same sort of work that individual merchants have been and are performing. This was and is useful enough for Africa, and beneficial to the merchant, as far as it can prudently go. But Africa now wants more than this. She wants powerful companies, that shall prudently but boldly stimulate and assist her to a much higher and more extensive industrial development. The Company of African Merchants is, and is intended to be, such an one. That it will open to England the great national storehouses of African cotton, we have no doubt; while it will be at the same time be helping forward and reaping other portions of its harvests in the long-opened fields of oils, gums, and other such articles of African produce. We long to see it, and we hope that we shall see it and kindred efficient organizations, take hold of certain richly-endowed districts of Africa with a firm and solid grasp—with a determination to squeeze from them their abundant natural stores, enriching them and elevating them morally and socially in the process—with a firm resolve to employ all those wealth-creating means which advancing civilization in Europe has gradually discovered and applied for stimulating industry and diffusing wealth, comfort, peace, and happiness, among mankind.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What the Royal Niger Company is Doing for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It should be borne in mind by those who look for quick and fabulous returns from their investments that Africa occupies a singular position.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products. By-and-by, when they are taught, they will begin to cultivate the soil and raise products which are in demand in Europe. Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Bright Prospects for Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have been long engaged in sounding in deaf or reluctant ears the great resources of that poor Africa which has been made and kept poor only by the demand for her crop of human beings to cultivate as slaves the soil of transatlantic lands, which, however rich they may be, cannot surpass her own.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country.

Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world.

H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

He stated that the continent of Africa had an area of nearly a quarter of the entire land of the globe, and it had presented greater obstacles to human enterprise than any other part of the earth's surface. Notwithstanding the many explorations of scientific people and travellers, both recently and in ancient times, of which he quoted several instances, the vast interior of Africa still remained almost a terra incognita, with its natural wealth undeveloped, and its mineral treasures unexplored. It had a climate fully equal to any other part of the world, and capable of yielding tropical and subtropical productions to any extent. Still, it was a lost continent, banished, as it were, from commercial intercourse with the civilized parts of the world. The most considerable part of our commerce with North Central Africa was carried across the Great Desert of Sahara from the shores of the Mediterranean. Caravans now performed dangerous and tedious journeys of many months' duration from Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis, and other ports to the kingdom of Soudan. Two thousand miles of sterile and mountainous country had to be traversed and hostile tribes encountered before the nearest market was reached. In spite of those difficulties, about three millions worth of British produce found its way annually from the North to Soudan, which kingdom had no less than twenty millions of inhabitants. The great importance of opening those regions to commerce could not for a moment be doubted, and Timbuctoo formed, he thought, the most favoured spot for such intercourse, situated as it was on the very edge of the Desert. His plan was to open a direct commercial highway from the mouth of the river Belta, in the neighbourhood of Capes Juby and Bogador, on the North-west Coast of Africa, opposite the Canary Islands, to the northern bend of the Niger, at Timbuctoo—a distance of about 800 miles. That would form the shortest route to the interior, and was within easy access of Europe and America, the mouth of the Belta being distant about 1,500 miles from England. The engineering difficulties were inconsiderable, since the physical formation of that part of the Desert of Sahara which had to be crossed favoured the project; a great tract of it, with an area of 126,000 square miles, and known as Eljuf, being a vast depression, considerably below the level of the Atlantic. It was bounded by fertile and populous regions, and inhabited by an industrious class of people, whose only commercial intercourse with Europe was carried on from Mogador. That depression was impregnated with salt, and it had, it was believed, formerly formed part of the bed of the sea. He contended that the climate, the geography, and the people were all favourable to the scheme, and if once the mouth of the Belta was cleared of sand, the waters of the Atlantic would fill their former bed; thus establishing a direct communication with North Central Africa within easy distance of our ports. Instead of a trade of three millions annually, it might be increased tenfold. The great continent of Africa would be opened to every wholesome influence, its vast resources would be developed, and the horrors of the slave-trade would no longer stain its history. He added that the proposed preliminary survey would enable them to obtain the necessary data to carry out the scheme, and that such survey would be comparatively inexpensive."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Future of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Karl Peters, on March 5, delivered a lecture on ""The Future of Africa,"" before a meeting of the Foreign Press Association, held at the Society of Arts, Adelphi, London.

There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry. A modern traveller had truly said that ""the greatest treasure of Africa consists in the inexhaustible labour force of its inhabitants."" The Native population, which was estimated at about 200 millions, only required to be organised by the whites in order to raise the natural wealth of the continent. A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon.

From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards.

It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

In 1856 he completed his second journey across Central Africa from Angola to the Zambezi delta. Prior to this period, the Church Missionary Society had sent three German missionaries to start work in East Africa. Johann Krapf arrived in Mombasa in 1844 and was followed by J. Rebmann in 1846 and by J.J. Erhardt in 1849. Their mission station was established at Rabai near Mombasa. By 1856 Rebmann had crossed the Nyika plain to Kilimanjaro to become the first European to see the mountain, and Krapf had gone farther south to visit the Shambaa kingdom of Kimweri and then north› wards to the Kamba country where he was the first European to be shown Mount Kenya. Erhardt and Krapf also travelled farther south to the mouth of the Ruvuma and later, after spending some time in Tanga, Erhardt was able to publish a map of East Africa containing a mass of information he had gathered on the coast about the interior, including the Great Lakes, which he represented as an inland sea. Erhardt's 'map was to be the main inspiration of Burton and Speke in their expedition of 1858'. 51 This first group of missionaries acted as pioneers; they gathered con› siderable information that was extremely valuable to those who followed them. Yet their information hardly came to the attention of the general public and it was only when Livingstone began his attacks on the Arab slave trade in speeches and writings that the popular imagination was caught. In the spirit of the capitalist free-trade conviction of his time, Livingstone was emphasizing the power of commerce, which, he believed, would integrate the vast interior with Christian Europe, thus relieving Africans of the poverty and humiliation caused by the slave trade. He therefore concentrated on travelling in search of navigable rivers, or what he called the 'open path for commerce and Christianity'.$^{52}$ The publication of his Missionary Travels$^{53}$ in 1857, together with his personal appeals, inspired the formation of the Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) by a group of English High Churchmen. The UMCA attempted to follow Livingstone's ideas by trying to enter the Zambezi region, only to find that neither the Zambezi nor the"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""The question of freed slaves attracted the attention of all missionary societies working in East Africa. Between 1858 and 1873 the CMS, UMCA and the Holy Ghost Fathers were all involved. The CMS continued to work at Rabai near Mombasa, where freed slaves from Bombay were sent to assist Rebmann. The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies. The impact of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work. As a result, the Scottish Free Church plunged for the first time into missionary work in Central Africa. In 1875 its first expedition penetrated the Zambezi and the Shire and planted a station at Blantyre on Lake Nyasa.

Partly in response to the French forward policy, the British showed no less eagerness to consolidate and defend their positions. The discovery of diamonds in 1869-70 in Griqualand West in South Africa, and the prospects of finding gold in large quantities, began to raise the fever of competition and alter the basis of the relationship between Europeans in Africa and between them and the Africans. Various European activities, hitherto pursued seemingly for their own sake or for humanitarian purposes, began to be re-evaluated from the point of view of their contribution to various European national interests. Explorers were no longer expected merely to satisfy scientific curiosity but were also encouraged to gather strategic intelligence and trade secrets. Missionaries were not just individual servants of God obeying a divine call to evangelize but were regarded as organized national agents of acculturation, part of whose objective was to weaken the cultural and commercial exclusivity of their hosts. Traders were not just seeking profit, but were preparing the way for their own nations to establish control. Thus the widespread collaboration between Africans and Europeans, seemingly to utilize Euro› pean ideas and European technologies for nation-building in the rev› olutionary situation of the nineteenth century began to be seen as subversive, contributing directly to the systematic abortion of the efforts of African leaders to reform and modernize their societies.\nIn the same vein, African rulers generally viewed the activities of abolitionists as negative. In many cases, with the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, and after resisting and stalling, they began to co-operate to the extent that alternative trade in agricultural produce, gold, ivory and other commodities came to replace the slave trade and there was no interference with the holding of slaves and other sources of enforced labour. There was thus a basis for co-operation. As noted above, increased use of slaves was the basis of that co-operation. The Europeans recognized this, but in the 1870s, while not abandoning that position, began to use emancipation as a potential factor for weakening the economic base of African states. It should be specifically noted in this connection that most of the armies the Europeans were raising were manned by emancipated African slaves loyal to their redeemers, who armed and commanded them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'South Africa, 1880-1935', 'content': ""Secondly, the discovery led to the pouring in of capital and technical personnel from Britain, Europe and the United States.

That South Africa should have led here is not surprising for, as Houghton has pointed out, Griqualand from being 'a forgotten no-man's-land inhabited by a few hundred Griqua under their chief Waterboer', thanks to the discovery of diamonds, 'suddenly became a focus of world interest'.$^{97}$ The discovery of gold did the same thing for the Transvaal and the areas south of the Limpopo river.\nEqually revolutionary was the impact of the mining industry on the provision of infrastructure in South Africa. The huge distances between settlements and towns - Johannesburg is 1540 km from Cape Town and the sparseness of the population had hitherto ruled out the construction of railways as a viable proposition. But the discovery of gold and diamonds made railways and roads not only necessary but also practical. It is not surprising then that railway construction began in the 1870s from different points - Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban - all leading first to the diamond fields and then after 1886 into the Transvaal. The length of railway line rose from no km by 1869 to 1700 km by 1889, 3300 km by 1899 and 4190 km by 1905 (see Fig. 16.4).$^{98}$ Side by side with railways went the construction of roads.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889.

Cameron must have been gratified by the reception which he met with. The Society awarded him their Gold Medal for this year. We had intended giving some account of the meeting, but since then Lieut. Cameron has been in the City, to receive the freedom and livery of the Turners\' Company, and the address Lieut. Cameron then delivered seems to us more detailed and luminous than his previous ones, on points especially interesting to our readers and especially worthy of record in the African Times. We omit Lieut. Cameron\'s pretty introduction and his statement of how greatly he was strengthened on his way by the belief that when he should return to England his work would be appreciated by his countrymen; after which he said: ""A sailor\'s trade is not to talk, but to try to do what he is directed to do. The country of Africa which I have traversed, and especially to the west of the Tanganyika, is one of the richest portions of the world; and if one was only in a position to give the climate a fair chance, it would be found to be far more healthy than that noble dependency of the British Empire, India. Ivory, which has been mentioned as one of the materials of the turners\' art and mystery, is there found in greater abundance than anywhere else. At Nyangwe the Arabs trading amongst themselves give 35 lb. of ivory for 7 lb. of beads or 5 lb. of cowries, and very often they are able to buy a tusk, irrespective of size, which may weigh from 100 lb. to 150 lb. by the present of an old copper bracelet or any worn-out, useless thing which may take the fancy of the natives. This country of Nyangwe, I firmly believe—in fact, I am sure—may be reached by the Congo; and hereafter I hope that, where my steps have been, we shall see a system of English trading-stations for the purchase not only of ivory, but for other merchandize, for the richness of the vegetable products of the country is something beyond description. I have walked along for fifty or sixty yards under a grove of nutmeg trees, with the whole ground covered with nutmegs, and no one knew what they were worth. Besides that, there are many other valuable products in abundance, many different species of cotton, and oil-producing palms. Up the valley of the Congo, to a height of 2,600 ft. above the level of the sea, the country is crowded with oil-palms; and hereafter that trade alone—leaving the question of ivory altogether on one side—will well be sufficient to repay any enterprising merchants of England who embark in it. The people in many of the countries I passed through are very clever smiths. They have not yet advanced to the art and mystery of turning, but some of their work, executed simply with a rough hand hammer without a handle, and with no file to finish off with, might favourably compare with a great deal which is shown in this advanced country of England, where we have all the appliances of modern machinery and workmanship to help us. Now, the land which furnishes all the articles I have mentioned is also opened up by two of the most magnificent systems of water-communication in the world. The River Congo has rapids at Ilalla, about 160 miles above its mouth, and beyond them the only other rapids that I know of are small ones a short way below Nyangwe, near where my route quits the Congo. But I think that river ought to be hereafter called the Livingstone, for, after all, it was he who really discovered its sources. In the Zambesi country there is a system of lacustrine rivers extending for a distance which makes the Congo one of the largest rivers in the world. Perhaps the Amazon and the Yang-Tse-Kiang may in volume be larger, but certainly the Congo is entitled to take third place amongst the rivers of the world. It has navigable affluents that reach north within 200 miles of Lake Nyassa, where at present, in memory of Livingstone, a colony is being formed, which has been reached from the Zambesi. Where my route passes near the sources of the Zambesi, and where you see so many rivers dotted on the map, there is a sandy plain, through which, if a canal was cut for twenty or thirty miles across an easy country, the two systems of the Congo and Zambesi might be joined, and a water communication formed between the East and West Coasts of Africa, with numerous navigable offsets on either side. Of course these rivers will be broken at times by rapids, but portages may be formed for the present; and hereafter—though in days far in the future, I am afraid—locks will be formed, so that there may be uninterrupted steam communication from the east to the west of tropical Africa, by the Congo and Zambesi systems, and we shall then tap the ivory trade completely. By large rivers which flow into the Congo from the north a short way in front of Nyangwe, we can get back into the country of Ulega, to which traders come 3,000 miles down the Nile to trade, and from which they draw their principal supplies of ivory. Now, ascending the Congo a thousand miles will take us into this marvellously rich country. Again, the offsets of the Tanganyika would also tap a great portion of the ivory trade which is now carried on by the Arabs trading from Zanzibar. The Zambesi, again, would form the means of obtaining ivory, if the communication was made by joining it to the Congo, and so giving access to its northern affluents. I passed numerous affluents of the Zambesi, some of which take their rise on the West Coast, and these would act as offsets to the main system. By that river, which you see marked on the map as falling into the Congo from the north, we should get close up to the sources of the Nile, so we should reach the water-sheds between the Nile and the Congo systems by a very short route instead of by the long one from Alexandria up a river which is far from healthy, and is choked with grass; while the country through which I have gone may be considered as fairly healthy.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Dr. Livingstone.—South African Reports', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A letter from Dr. Livingstone was read by the secretary, dated from Ngomano, Rovuma River, May 18. The traveller had penetrated thirty miles further than his furthest point in 1861, and was preparing for his advance to the unknown northern extremity of Lake Nyassa. On the arrival of his party at the mouth of the Rovuma, it was found impossible to discover a path for the camels through the mangrove swamps. The vessel consequently proceeded twenty-five miles further to the north, and a good harbour and starting-point were then found in Mikindany Bay. The harbour within the bay is land-locked, and has good anchorage in ten to fourteen fathoms. From this place they marched overland to the south-west, and on arriving on the banks of the Rovuma, followed its course to the junction of the Loendi, a river coming from the south-west, and considered by Dr. Livingstone to be a continuation of the main stream. The chief of Ngomano, at the junction, proved most friendly, and the doctor intended to make this his head-quarters until he had felt his way round Lake Nyassa. The Rovuma is flanked on both sides by a chain of hills from 400 to 600 feet high, covered with dense entangled jungle. The natives, the Makonde tribe, were found to be willing workers, and aided in clearing a path for the men and animals. Traces of coal were found on the banks of the river.\n\nColonel Playfair (Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar) stated that the harbour at which Dr. Livingstone's expedition disembarked had only recently been discovered. He had no doubt that other harbours existed on the eastern coast, as it had never yet been thoroughly surveyed. Opposite the island of Zanzibar a new harbour had recently been found, and a port established there by the Sultan."", 'last_edit_date': '1868-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1868#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LETTERS OF DR.

Some conjectured that it went into Tanganyika, but I saw that to do so it must run uphill. Others imagined that it might flow into the Atlantic. It was to find out where it actually did go that took me into Manyuema. I could get no information from traders outside, and no light could be obtained from Manyuema within—they never travel, and it was so of old. They consist of petty headmanships, and each brings his grievance from some old feud, and is worse than our old Highland ancestors. Every headman of a hamlet would like to see every other ruling blockhead slain. But all were kind to strangers; and though terrible fellows among themselves, with their large spears and huge wooden shields, they were never known to injure foreigners till slavers tried the effects of gunshot upon them, and captured their women and children. As I could get no geographical information from them, I had to feel my way, and grope in the interminable forests and prairies, and three times took the wrong direction, going northerly, not knowing that the great river makes immense sweeps to the west and south-west. I felt as if I were running my head against a stone wall. It might, after all, turn out to be the Congo; and who would risk being eaten and converted into black man for it? I had serious doubts, but stuck to it like a Briton, and at last found that the mighty river left its westing and flowed right away to the north. The two great western drains, the Lufira and Lomame, running north-east before joining the central line or main river, Lualaba—told that the western side of the Great Valley was high, like the eastern, and as this main is reported to go into large reedy lakes, it can scarcely be anything else but the western arm of the Nile. But, besides all this—which is quite possible I may be mistaken—we have two fountains on, probably, the seventh hundred mile of the watershed, and giving rise to two rivers, the Liambai, or Upper Zambese, and the Kafue, which flow into Inner Ethiopia, and two fountains are reported to rise in the same quarter, and, forming Lufira and Lomame, flow, as we have seen, north. These four full-grown gushing fountains, rising so near each other, and giving origin to four large rivers, answer in a certain degree to the description given of the unfathomable fountains of the Nile by the secretary of Minerva in the city of Sais, in Egypt, to the father of all travelers, Herodotus. But I have to confess that it is a little presumptuous in me to put this forward in Central Africa, and without a single book of reference, on the dim recollection of reading the ancient historian in boyhood. The waters were said to well up from an unfathomable depth, and then part, half north to Egypt and half south to Inner Ethiopia. Now, I have heard of the fountains afore-mentioned so often that I cannot doubt their existence, and I wish to clear up the point in my concluding trip. I am not to be considered as speaking without hesitation, but prepared, if I see reason, to confess myself wrong. No one would like to be considered a disciple of the testy, old, would-be geographer, who wrote \'Inner Africa Laid Open,\' and swore to his fancies until he became blue in the face. The work would all have been finished long ago had the matter of supplies of men and goods not been entrusted by mistake to Banians and their slaves, whose efforts were all faithfully directed towards securing my failure. These Banians are protected English subjects, and by their money, their muskets, their ammunition, the East African Moslem slave trade is mainly carried on. The cunning East Indians secure most of the profits of the slave trade, and adroitly let the odium rest on their Arab agents. The Banians will not harm a flea or a mosquito, but my progress in geography had led me to the discovery that they are by far the worst cannibals in all Africa. They compass, by means of Arab agents, the destruction of more human lives for gain in one year than the Manyuema do for their flesh-pots in ten. The matter of supplies and men was unwittingly committed to these our Indian fellow-subjects, who hate to see me in their slave market, and dread my disclosures on the infamous part they play. The slaves were all imbued with the idea that they were not to follow, but force me back, and after rioting on my goods for sixteen months on the way instead of three, the whole stock of goods was sold off for slaves and ivory. Some of the slaves who came to Manyuema so baffled and worried me, that I had to return between 500 and 600 miles. The only help I have received, except half a supply which I dispatched from Zanzibar in 1868, has been from Mr. Stanley, your travelling correspondent, and certain remains of stores which I seized from the slaves sent from Zanzibar seventeen months ago; and I had to come back 300 miles to effect the seizure. I wait here—Unyanyembe—only till Mr. Stanley can send me fifty free men from the coast, and then I proceed to finish up the geographical part of my mission. I come back to the slavery question, and I am permitted in any way to promote its suppression, I shall not grudge the toil and time I have spent. It would be better to lessen human woe than discover the sources of the Nile.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.749, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GEOGRAPHY OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""tent of country between the Tanganyika Lake of Burton and Speke, and the Zambesi and Shire of Livingstone? Are we not at this moment most anxious to determine by positive observation whether there exists a great series of lakes and rivers proceeding, as Cooley has suggested, from Tanganyika on the north, to Lake Nyassa on the south? and has not Livingstone's very last effort been directed to this point? If central Africa is ever to advance in civilization, and its inhabitants are to be brought into commercial relations with Europe, one of the best chances of our accomplishing it will, in my opinion, consist in rendering the great White Nile a highway of intercourse and traffic. And if the present ruler of Egypt shall bring about this most desirable end, by putting a stop to the lawless slave-trade, carried on beyond his frontiers under the guise of dealing in ivory, and by establishing marts of commerce on the banks of the great river, Africa will owe more to him than to any ruler since the days of the Roman emperors, who, though they tried, never succeeded in opening out the regions around the head waters of the Nile. In touching upon this subject, I have to congratulate you on the news which has arrived, that that chivalrous explorer, Mr. Samuel Baker, is successfully examining the central equatorial regions, from which, I trust, he will bring us the solution of some of the problems already adverted to, and will determine the real source of the waters which supply the Luta N'zigé of Speke and Grant. I have also to announce that Baron Von der Decken has proceeded on his bold adventure to explore the interior of Africa from the east coast, by ascending the Juba, or one of the adjacent rivers, with two river steamers constructed at his own cost. In making these allusions to African discovery, most heartily do I congratulate geographers on the safe return of my excellent and disinterested friend Livingstone. Already, after his first two great traverses from east to west and from west to east across South Africa, this undaunted missionary has won for himself imperishable renown. But now, after a second expatriation which has lasted upwards of six years (his previous journeys occupying sixteen years), during which he has been labouring conjointly to improve the condition of the natives and to extend geographical knowledge, he comes home with a firm resolution to adhere to his noble calling for the benefit of the natives, and to return to that country in which every black man must bless his name. The return also of Captain Burton ensures for us some fresh and pregnant communications respecting Western Africa; and when we know that Francis Galton, though much occupied with the duties of a general secretary, will always take part in our discussions, and that Barth is likely to be present, it is probable that we shall have a concourse of travellers, capable of illustrating the geography and ethnology of Africa, such as was never assembled at any former meeting."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.753, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""MR.

After alluding to the services which Scotland has rendered to geographical science, especially in the person of Livingstone, Mr. O\'Neill described the circumstances which induced him to resolve to fill up, as far as possible, the great blank in the map of Eastern Africa. The results of his journeys Mr. O\'Neill summarised as follows:—\n\n""Briefly, the chief results have been to open up three new routes between the Nyassa district and the coast: 1, between Mozambique and Lake Shirwa and Blantyre; 2, from Blantyre to the Portuguese settlements of Angoche and Parapato; 3, from Quillimane to Blantyre. You know the length of time it took to get overland to Lake Nyassa from the east coast. Many of you remember the hardships encountered by Bishop Steere when getting over the same ground. The Nyassa may now be reached by the longest route in thirty days, and by that from Quillimane to Blantyre in fourteen. The country you pass over is well-populated, food abundant, and the people peaceable, helpful, and industrious. There are difficulties of course, African travel is never without them; but any or all of the three routes I have laid down may be constantly traversed by Europeans, and become most valuable channels for the development of the trade and agriculture of the country. In my journeys I have been fortunate enough to discover three minor lakes: one, Lake Lidedi, just south of the Rovuma, and close to Lake Nargadi, of which Livingstone first heard as he passed north of that river upon his last travels. The others are Lake Amaramba and Cheuta, which have their outlet in the River Lujenda. When in the neighbourhood of these lakes I closely investigated the question of the supposed connexion of Lake Shirwa with the Lujenda drainage system, and satisfied myself that there was no point of junction between them. Lake Shirwa is divided from the Lakes Cheuta and Amaramba by a broad elevated ridge of sandy soil, lightly wooded and covered with thick undergrowth, and I have nowhere detected trace of inundation or evidence of the rising of Lake Shirwa above the level of its foot. It is possible that a subterranean junction exists, and this view is held by many natives.""\n\nMr. O\'Neill dwelt upon the importance of a reliable meridian in the interior for the traveller. He described the very interesting evidences of glacial action met with in the hilly regions, and stated he had never met with any traces of subsequent volcanic action, and that he doubts the hypotheses respecting volcanic disturbance. Remarking that though Eastern Africa has not the exuberant vegetation or magnificent forests of Brazil, the Congo region, and other parts of the world, Mr. O\'Neill added that the air is drier, there is less malaria, and the country is more fit for the residence of Europeans.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-07-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

Lupton Bey carried ivory from the Makua basin, on the Congo side of the watershed, overland to Meshra, and he claimed to show a net profit of £60,000. Its transport down the Mobangi will be far easier, and cheaper. ""Take away the ivory, turn a lucrative trade from Khartoum to the Congo, and the great incentive to slave-hunting and slave wars is gone."" The power of the Soudan rebels is broken; what will be the position of the slave-hunting tribes of the Soudan if they are approachable from the rear through a country peopled by natives—the Zandehs—who are eager for protection under European administrators, and whose countrymen are the soldiers who have helped Emin to hold out so long? No part of Africa offers a more interesting study to the scientific explorer. Readers of Dr. Schweinfurth will remember the Monbuttus of the region where the Makua rises, their king Mutnza, with his vast hall, and the highly developed political system which gave to their cannibalism something of the character of civilization. Not less remarkable are the Zandehs lower down the river, and the tribes which inhabit its islands and banks still further west. Should the Mobangi prove to be the Makua, the importance of the treaty by which the Free State has extended the boundary of French territory on the west bank of the Congo to a line drawn down the middle of the Mobangi will be vastly increased, as it may enable the French to tap the trade of the whole of the district south-east of Lake Chad to the district of the Nyanzas. Should the Makua be the upper waters of the Shari, the Royal Niger Company is not unlikely to enjoy similar advantages. It is possible, even in the other event—that is, if the Makua joins the Mobangi— that the Royal Niger Company may be able to approach by the Binúé or other rivers close to this magnificent highway to north-eastern Africa. In that case much would depend upon how far France might extend her claim to the north bank. In the settlement of this question Germany will demand to be heard, as the region lies at the back of the Cameroons.

The latest dates of direct information with respect to the great traveller\'s movements and whereabouts will seem to the reader unversed in African distances and delays discouragingly remote. But there is no reason, Sir Roderick Murchison urges, for alarm. Notes written by Livingstone in October and November, 1867, from Marunga and Cazembe, places which lie S. and S.S.W. of Lake Tanganyika, have been received by Dr. Kirk at Zanzibar. Livingstone, it appears, when he last wrote, had been living for three months with a friendly Arab tribe, waiting for the close of a native war, before proceeding to Ujiji, with the intention of exploring Lake Tanganyika, and thence pushing on to Zanzibar. At Ujiji Livingstone would find provisions, medicine, letters, &c., and would learn the discoveries of Sir Samuel Baker. This information, Sir Roderick thinks, would induce him to attempt the solution of ""the great problem of the Nilotic watershed of Africa, by determining whether the great lakes (Albert Nyanza and Tanganyika) are united or separated by highlands, and if separated, by ascertaining into what river-system Tanganyika discharges its surplus waters."" Ten months would suffice, probably, to complete this work and to bring Livingstone to the seacoast.

As an account of these discoveries has already been published, I shall allude to them very briefly. The most important of these rivers is the Mobangi. Mr. Grenfell ascended it as far as 4° 30' N. latitude. As he proceeded northward, he perceived certain differences in the natives, as compared with those he was accustomed to on the Congo. These latter are known by the generic name of Bantu, while the Mobangi native appeared to have characteristics similar to the natives of the Cameroons and the Gold Coast, which properly belong to the Fan tribe. As these rivers are explored, and the border lands of these two great nations, the Bantu and Fan, become better known, an interesting study will be afforded to the ethnologist. A little beyond 4° N. lat., Mr. Grenfell had to return, but not before he had ascertained that the course of the Mobangi tended to the eastward. Now the size and the volume of this tributary of the Congo prove it the offspring of many waters, while its direction points that it may have its origin in the Niam-Niam and Mangbattu countries; in fact, that it is the Makua or Welle of Schweinfurth. It is always satisfactory when the disjointed discoveries of a great river are connected by a complete survey, and the unknown becomes the known. Let us hope this will soon be the case with the Mobangi, and whether it proves to be the Welle, or whether it has its origin in the territory lying to the north of the Congo, either problem will be most interesting from a geographical point of view, for if the former, it will complete the work begun by Schweinfurth; if the latter, it will add to our knowledge a portion of Africa hitherto unexplored.\n\nA German expedition under the auspices of the Berlin Geographical Society, composed of Lieuts.

G. Grenfell. Details are now to hand from Mr. Grenfell, which prove what an admirable piece of exploring work he has done. He shows that the Mobangi, which enters the right bank of the Congo between 26\' and 42\' S. lat., nearly opposite Equator Station, is probably its greatest tributary. Certainly it offers a much longer waterway that any affluent that has been explored. Mr. Grenfell navigated the Mobangi in the little steamer Peace from the equator to 4° 30\' N. lat., and left it still an open waterway. At 4° 23\', N. just below the second rapids he found it 673 yards wide; at no point lower was it less in width. The mean depth is 25\' feet, and although the current runs not more than 80 or 100 feet per minute, it means an immense volume of water to find running south at a point, as Mr. Grenfell puts it, so near the supposed source of the Binué, the great affluent of the Niger. Where does it all come from? he asks, the ""trumbashes"" of the Chad basin are common, while they are not known on the Congo. The opinion of Mr. Grenfell is that the Mobangi is probably the lower part of the Welle, a river whose course is one of the unsolved problems of African geography. This is certainly a more likely solution than to connect the Welle with the Aruwime. Dr. Junker, the Russian explorer, did not follow the Welle so far west as either to confirm or disprove Mr. Grenfell\'s conjecture. It would seem that the Mobangi is navigable a distance of probably 400 to 450 miles, taking account of the bends. A large map, in ten sheets, of the explored part of the river has lately been received at the Royal Geographical Society, which may be expected to appear in an early number of the Society\'s proceedings. The Mobangi, Mr. Grenfell writes, is far more populous than any equal length of the Congo, and to his mind the country is more promising. The people are wild, and he was the first white man they had seen. In ascending the river Mr. Grenfell met with many difficulties from the hostilities of the natives, and had it not been for energetic action he and his party would probably have come to grief. His way down the river was most encouraging; plenty of food and not a sign of hostility. He hopes to make the trip again, and has no doubt that he will be able to report peaceable and friendly receptions everywhere. He may also be able to penetrate further towards the valley of the Shari, the great tributary of Lake Chad. Unfortunately, Mr. Grenfell states, the confluence of the Mobangi with the Congo is just within French territory, though it is not so represented on the map in Mr. Stanley\'s last book or on the latest map of the Royal Geographical Society. Immediately after Mr. Grenfell\'s return to Stanley Pool, M. de Brazza left Brazzaville, to examine for himself the great waterway discovered by the English missionary, and possibly to follow it farther. If so, we are sure to hear of his ""great journey of discovery."" The commercial importance of Mr. Grenfell\'s discovery cannot be exaggerated. Whether the Mobangi is the Welle or not, it must form an important connecting link between the basin of the Congo and the basins of the Niger, the Shari, and the Nile. Mr. Stanley has always maintained that the region between the Congo and the Nile is probably the richest and most promising in Africa, and his belief seems likely to be amply confirmed. Besides the Mobangi, Mr. Grenfell has explored 300 miles of river-courses debouching into the Congo, and, as he is a trained and careful surveyor, he will be able to define them with great precision.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'An Expedition to the Sources of the Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Congo Commercial Company, who have already done much to open up the Upper river and its affluents, have decided to send out a fresh expedition for the purpose of attempting the solution of the remaining problems connected with the remote feeders of the great river. A glance at a map will show that towards the south-east the territories of the Congo Free State are bounded on the east by three lakes—Tanganyika, Moero, and Bangweolo—and dotted from south to north by a series of smaller lakes among which are those of Lohemba and Upamba. These latter lakes, more or less conjectural, seem to constitute the reservoirs of the Congo. The main stream is formed, so far as is known at present, of three main branches: (1) the Lualaba, which some regard as the principal, and which comes from the south-west, forming on the map a chain of lakelets, of which only two have been seen—by Cameron and Reichard; (2) the Luapula, of which the Chambesi is the upper course, and which traverses Lakes Bangweolo and Moero, discovered by Livingstone; (3) the Lukuga, which issues from Lake Tanganyika and flows direct westwards. According to information obtained from natives and Arab traders, these three rivers unite at a common centre, where the waters form a large lake, known as Lanji, which no white traveller has seen. The country of Urua, on the west of Tanganyika, into which the expedition will penetrate, has just been touched by one or two explorers. Among them are Capello and Ivens, Reichard and Arnot, all of whom speak in glowing terms of the fertility of the region, of its salubrity, and its richness in minerals. It lies so high and is so cold sometimes as almost to freeze. It is a region on which it is desirable to have full information, in the interests of both commerce and geography. It has been stated that Mr. Stanley is likely in the future to undertake a special mission to the Upper Congo. However that may be, it is to be hoped that the Congo Company will carry out their intentions; there is plenty of room here for several expeditions. The proposed expedition will be under the command of M. Alexandre Delcommune, who has already done good work in exploring some of the Congo tributaries, and has been seventeen years on the river. He will be accompanied by Lieut. Hackanson, of the Swedish army, formerly one of the agents of the Congo Free State; Dr. Briart; Lieut. Santsschoff, formerly of the Russian army; Baron Marcel de Roert; M. Norbert Didderich, an engineer; and M. Protsch. MM. Hackanson, Briart, and Santsschoff have already sailed; M. Delcommune leaves on July 6; and M. Didderich on the 3rd. The escort will consist of 150 native soldiers. The expedition will meet at Kiachassa about the middle of September, and embarking on the steamer Roi des Belges, will proceed by the Upper Congo and its tributary, the Lomami, to the limit of navigation on the latter river, nearly opposite Nyangwé.

Livingstone, alas! is dead; but the great work that he inaugurated—war to the death against the atrocious East African foreign slave trade—will not perish. All that has of late been done by the British Government for its total suppression, owes its origin to the good Doctor's fearless and untiring exposure of the enormous sin and crime being daily perpetrated in those countries.

F. Scott Elliot. The lecture was followed with much interest as an exposition from an authority on the subject. Mr. Scott Elliot, by his recent visit to Ruwenzori, has afforded additional information about this magnificent range of mountains in Central Africa, and his treatment of the subject was graphic and most informing. The address was made the more interesting by a series of limelight views. After touching on the character of Africa generally, the lecturer proceeded to give an account of the mountain Ruwenzori, the various difficulties in climbing the primeval forest, its inhabitants, the bamboo zone, the peat mosses, and the various tribes round the mountain. The occurrence of recent volcanic craters, and the manner in which the cloud hangs over the mountain all day long, only disappearing about sunset, was fully illustrated by slides from photographs taken by the lecturer. The lecturer described his experiences. Leopards attacked his camp, and very nearly killed two of his porters. A woman was carried off by a lioness, and he vainly attempted to rescue her. Elephants were extremely abundant round the mountain. The Natives were usually friendly, though the difficulty of obtaining supplies was often considerable, and on one occasion three of his men were attacked by them, and one very severely wounded. His march to the South was one of extraordinary difficulty, as his caravan consisted only of fourteen men, and the people were in places extremely unfriendly, and on one occasion attacked his porters. The future value of these little-known regions was shown by him to depend mainly on three factors—First, the natural wild resources, as rubber, palm oil, minerals, and ivory; secondly, the prospects of plantation by Europeans; and thirdly, the health of Europeans. The country between 3,000 and 5,000 feet had been proved to be valuable for plantations of coffee and tobacco. It is only in Africa above 5,000 feet that there is any possibility of a real colony being formed. The lecturer expressed his opinion that with the knowledge we have now of these parts, the Masai Highlands certainly appear to be quite healthy enough for Europeans to live and bring up children; but that so far there is no sufficient inducement for colonisation at present. Then, turning to the needs of Great Britain at the present time, he suggested that the three main requisites at present were—first, that our imports of food and raw material should come from our own Colonies; secondly, new markets; and thirdly, an outlet for our capital and population, both of which were unnaturally locked up in Great Britain. These new countries were, according to him, exactly adapted to answer those three urgent necessities.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE EXPLORATION OF THE NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Among those who have lately done so much to make the geography of Africa familiar to Europeans, Mr. Joseph Thomson may fairly claim a prominent position. He has just returned from the Niger, where he went eight months ago on behalf of the African Trading Company. How rapid has been his progress on this important river is evidenced by the fact that in seven months he has performed the journey from London to Sokoto and back; three of these months were passed on the ocean. During that time Mr. Thomson succeeded in accomplishing the important mission with which he was intrusted. With the Sultans of Gando and Sokoto he has made treaties which give the company command of the Niger up almost to Timbuctoo, and of the Binue, its great tributary, to the limits of navigation. The company are at liberty to trade over all the dominions of these potentates, and treaties have been drawn out with such exactitude that neither the Sultans nor any European rivals can misunderstand them. Indeed, it is stated that Herr Flegel, who followed Mr. Thomson on the Binue on behalf of a German company, has been summarily turned out of the river. Mr. Thomson speaks in the highest terms of the value of the Niger as a trade route. The whole country is densely peopled with Mahomedan tribes, who have a passion for voluminous wrappings. The country is fertile, and, with ordinary care, not unhealthy. It is pretty certain the British Government will formally recognize these recent acquisitions of the company by extending to them its protection. Mr. Thomson was cordially received by the Sultan of Sokoto, who seemed delighted at the prospect of having direct trade dealings with England.\n\nIn Mr. Thomson\'s work on the Central African Lakes, he takes a desponding view of the resources of Africa.

In this pessimistic view he is supported by Dr. Fisher, who preceded him in the Kilimanjaro region, and who had before that resided for seven years in Zanzibar. Dr. Fisher has just published a little volume (""More Light on the Dark Continent""), to show that from a commercial point of view Africa is worthless!

The articles also highlight the exploitation of West Africa's rich mineral resources by European powers and discuss the potential for future gold finds, while noting challenges such as lack of capital and labor in the gold-mining industry.

However, the focus is more on the broader economic changes and the impact of colonialism on the primary sector, rather than the specific mode of transport for gold. The absence of details about steamships transporting gold dust and specie is a notable difference, as it suggests that while West Africa was indeed a critical source of valuable natural resources, the textbook does not emphasize the specific logistics of their transport in the context of global trade.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa.

Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives.

Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods.

In local trade it was used to purchase salt, kola nuts, boubous (loose ankle-length robes), slaves, livestock and grain. According to L. G. Binger, bar salt from the desert was much more highly regarded than other kinds. It came from Taoudeni by way of Timbuktu, Mopti, Jenne, Bla and San, subsequently being distributed throughout the Sahel and the savanna country. The same was true of the salt that reached Segu by way of Adrar and Tichit. Sea salt from the coast and salt collected from the river saltpan at Daboya was carried as far as Kong. In the Volta region of the Sahel, the chiefs of Jiibo developed a cunning technique for accumu› lating slaves. If a slave killed someone and then gave himself up to the chief, he would be acquitted and would become the property of the latter; in cases of theft, if the thief was rich the chief would strip him of his wealth.$^{54}$ By the end of the century, the population of Dori included 50000 free men and 50000 captives. Yet the careful and observant traveller, Heinrich Barth, who passed through the region in 1853, says nothing about slaves in his account. This points to a substantial increase in slave-trading in the region during the second half of the century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': 'The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

The Mohammedan traders on the west coast of Sierra Leone, when asked where they get their precious metals and fine work, turn round and point to the north-east—Segoo, Bambara. Why have we not been in Bambara years ago? A light railway should have been run up to the north-east. The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers. They are tapping all that rich region while we remain inert.\n\nWest Africa has, from interested motives, been represented as unhealthy for Europeans. This illusion is being rapidly dispelled by disinterested travellers. The Englishman, through unhealthy habits, may dig his own grave even in England, as so many thousands do annually. Besides, were London as innocent of sanitary arrangements as Freetown, it would soon become the white man\'s grave in grim reality. A man unaddicted to drink and gluttony may live, and does live, an enjoyable life in West Africa; he enjoys it so much that, like Emin Pasha, he refuses to be rescued. Officers and others have told me they preferred being out there for a time, not only because they liked the life, but because ""dear old Cox"" has been able to transfer the balance of their account from the debit to the credit side.\n\nWest Africa is the coming country; it teems with wealth; it is within easy distance of this country, and can be brought within six days of the London market if necessary. All that we require to do is to get rid of the drink, open out the country as honest people, and make room for our surplus population, from the nobleman\'s son down to the humblest artisan and labourer. There is fibre there for our manufacturers of Lancashire and Yorkshire; there is gold, silver, copper, coal, precious stones, ivory, india-rubber, nitrate, indigo, antimony, guano, palm oil, kola, ebony, mahogany, gum-copal, potash, ginger, gum, iron, farinaceous foods, dye woods, tanning material, spices, coffee, tobacco, cocoa, cotton, and other produce. Some of these vegetable products grow wild. Horses, camels, and sheep, can be bred in the north-east. The list of articles to be found on the coast reads like the inventory of a Liverpool warehouse. The wealth of West Africa is simply boundless, illimitable. It confirms Lord Palmerston\'s prediction of it in 1860, when he said that it ""would be a source of wealth, not to Europe only, but to the world, to such an extent that imagination itself could hardly follow it.""', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.736, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Rubber, palm kernels, palm oil, and benni seed (an oil-producing substance) constitute the bulk of the exports of Sierra Leone. The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour.

Going back fifty years ago, to 1836, we find no definite statistics for the Gold Coast; while Gambia exported no less than in 1875—£147,000. The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony. The value of the rubber exported is about £6,000 annually.

It is believed that the Greeks received gold from these parts 2,900 years ago. Of recent times our first African traveller, Mungo Park, proved the existence of gold north of the Kong Mountain, and described the methods by which gold was won by the Natives; a plan similar to that adopted by the Natives south of the same range. The present gold supply comes from Ashanti, and possibly the bulk of it from Wassau. A little over 40 years ago our principal supply came from the Gold Coast; but when California and Australia came to the front as gold producers, the Gold Coast was to a great extent lost sight of. Since the first supply of gold in 1471, the total amount received from West Africa has been estimated by Captain Burton at £600,000,000, an amount not in the least exaggerated, I should say, when we take into account the regular yearly returns made for a period exceeding 200 years. Other authorities estimate that in the space of 40 years no less an amount than £200,000,000 could have been received. The surface soil in some parts of the country seems to be full of gold; it has been found on the sea beach, in rivers, and even washed from the gutters of the streets of the small towns after rain. Rich mines are found in Gaman and Wassau, the principal gold fields being on the Wassau range. Expeditions have been made from time to time, and quite recently discoveries are reported from the north-west part of the Colony. Such work is slow; the country is covered with dense forest, which makes progress in travelling and surface examinations difficult. As there is traditionally great wealth in the Kong mountains, it would seem wise to construct a line of rails through the country with the object of tapping this region. We are met with the suggestion that it would be a worthless undertaking from the point of trade. This, however, is problematic. There is the conviction that gold obtains abundantly in the interior, which could be confirmed; that there is produce or a country capable of producing it is certain.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-09-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_09_1893#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some of the Difficulties in the Way of Extending Trade in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The gold-mining industry, which it was hoped a few years ago would have done much for the colony, has not succeeded as it deserved, and that from many causes.

In the present famine of gold, it is very necessary that all sources of supply of the precious metal should be utilized; but until the conditions under which mining is pursued on the coast of Africa are fundamentally altered, the person who would invest money in the exploitation of gold mines would be very sanguine and would prove also very unfortunate.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'British Trade in North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The success of the gold fields of South Africa is serving to  \ndraw attention to the Gold Coast as another source of produc-  \ntion of the precious metal; and as special reports of the gold  \nmines of that country have recently been made by the Governor,  \nit is evident that the authorities have been desirous of gaining  \nfurther knowledge, or reassuring themselves, with the presumed  \nobject of stimulating enterprise.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

In 1884, the exports amounted to £2,000,000, and imports £1,700,000. Two millions of the total trade must be credited to the Gold Coast and Lagos, in which palm oil and palm kernels are of so much importance.

Nearly the whole of the expenditure is for administration, leaving little for public works and the development of the resources of the settlements. The exports during the past ten years show considerable fluctuations in value, depending partly on the market value of the staple products, and partly on the more or less disturbed state of the interior, where the native tribes are constantly at war with each other. In 1875, the value of the exports on the Gold Coast was £327,012; in 1879, it was £751,850; in 1881, 1882, and 1883, it hovered round £350,000; suddenly advancing to £667,000 in 1884. For Lagos, the exports were valued at £517,535 in 1875, £734,707 in 1877, £460,000 in 1881, £594,000 in 1883, and £672,000 in 1884. For the last ten years the exports of Sierra Leone have kept pretty steadily at about £580,000; in 1876 they sank to £297,000, and in 1882 and 1883 rose to £420,000 and £442,000. Gambia shows considerably more variation; in 1875, the exports were valued at £147,465, sinking to £86,000 in 1876, and, with intermediate fluctuations, reaching £254,711 in 1882. Still the progress of the West African colonies during the past twenty-five years in all respects has been very marked, as will be seen from the following table:—\n\n|          | Population. | Revenue. | Tonnage. | Imports. | Exports. |\n|----------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| 1861...  | 289,900     | £69,000  | 230,850  | £517,620 | £550,860 |\n| 1884...  | 800,960     | £285,057 | 1,417,284| £1,741,000| £1,716,000|', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""We have pretty well worked up about three-fourths of the markets of the world and glutted them, leaving the remainder, Africa, almost untouched; for, as yet, except in South Africa, our trade has but barely penetrated beyond the coast line, and our merchants remain at the outposts competing with each other and over-working the local markets. Expeditions are rapidly following one another and giving us full information about the interior of Equatorial Africa. Railways and canals are proposed for the opening up of that part of Africa, and they will, years hence, no doubt, prove an incalculable benefit; but why should we wait for these costly works? Why not utilize the arteries already provided by nature for traffic with the interior? Northwest Africa is a market to a great extent as yet unworked. The markets of Sego and Timbuctoo, Hamdallahi, and other large towns on the Upper Niger are most inadequately supplied with British goods by caravans from Tunis, Tripoli, Mogador, and Senegal, and the carriage is so expensive that none but the lightest and most valuable can be imported across the desert. Now the French river, Senegal, though it drains the country for over 700 miles, is practically useless as a channel of commerce. It has a bad and dangerous bar. Ships have often to lie outside weeks, and even months, waiting to enter the port of St. Louis. Its channel into the interior is full of sand bars and rocks, obstructing navigation by even small craft for most of the year; and the tribes to the north-east of its head-waters, of Arab origin, are ferocious and predatory, living by plunder; therefore, commerce meets with danger and difficulty in their neighbourhood. About 180 miles to the south is the Gambia, which seems intended by nature to be the main road for commerce, civilization, and religion into North-west Africa. At all states of the tide, at all seasons of the year, you have a deep and safe channel over the bar; vessels of 2,000 to 3,000 tons can come in and anchor off Bathurst, and discharge and load. The traffic up the river is carried on by large cutters and schooners. Even oceangoing vessels of large tonnage go up to M\'Carthy Island, 185 miles from the mouth, and load.

For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.753, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen. The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Clearly, therefore, some accounts of British imperialism in South Africa have neglected the growing economic importance of the region to Britain, a situation which became increasingly apparent at the end of the 1860s with the discovery of diamonds and reports of gold deposits, and most evident in the i88os when gold began to be mined in the Witwatersrand.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'South Africa, 1880-1935', 'content': ""Secondly, the discovery led to the pouring in of capital and technical personnel from Britain, Europe and the United States.

For instance, when the Charter of the Niger Company was revoked in 1899, the company was compensated £150000 for its mining rights in the region where tin mining was later established. According to the same agreement, the company was to receive as much as 50% of all royalties from mining for ninety-nine years.$^{59}$ This was a very heavy price for the local population to pay, but the situation was even worse in the Rhodesias, where mining rights remained in the hands of the British South Africa Company until 1933 when they were purchased by the state for £2 000 000.$^{60}$ But even after this change the local population was rarely regarded, and even more rarely treated, as the beneficiaries of mining operations.

Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form. North African economies were as much part of a Mediterranean complex as they were part of the African trans-Saharan network. Prior experience with the European economy allowed segments of North African society to accommodate to the intensifi› cation of production for Europe and to the spread of European commodities in local markets. But the well-defined and exploitative ruling class was determined to defend state frontiers, even if willing to enter closer economic relations with Europeans. Therefore, colonial rule often advanced while maintaining North Africans in nominal authority, and the colonial economy was institutionalized before the complete subjugation of the indigenous polities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

The very process of dismantling of the monopoly powers of chartered companies was however 'a gradual one', we are told; the shift to free trade 'was therefore somewhat limited'; and the explanation of the shift resided primarily in 'practical business reasons', to wit, the lower overhead costs and greater flexibility of response to an expanding slave-trade market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': ""The ultimate decline of Britain's advantage had nothing to do with developments in the periphery of the world-economy.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': ""It was neither a deliberate policy on the part of British colonial rulers which saved the land in British West Africa for the Africans during the inter-war period, nor was it because of the notorious reputation that West Africa had acquired as 'the White Man's Grave' by the late nineteenth century.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 200, 'article_title': 'OUR THIRD VOLUME.', 'full_section_title': 'OUR THIRD VOLUME.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-10', 'issue_date': '23_07_1863', 'content': 'We have therefore no hesitation in calling upon our friends and subscribers not only to continue to us their individual support, but also to use their efforts for obtaining _new subscribers to this journal_, and _new subscribers to the African-Aid Society_, upon whose prosperity so much of the future usefulness of this journal depends.

The extension of commerce, stimulating to the development of the rich agricultural and mineral resources of the African countries, must be effected by Africans who in the British Coast Settlements may have received that degree of education and enlightenment which should fit them to be the pioneers of civilization in the interior. These, instead of finding the climate of the interior less suited to their natures than that of the Coast, would find it in every way superior. Missionary effort and trading operations on the Coast have raised up an ample supply of such Africans to found settlements up the Gambia, and elsewhere if necessary, under European protection and management. The proposed Association for the Upper Gambia Countries would have little difficulty, if given adequate inducement, in procuring the requisite number of such trained Africans, provided they were assured, as they would be under Government sanction, of just and equitable treatment, of proper consideration for their feelings and their wants, and of the certainty that they would be secured in the possession of the agreed fruits of their labours. We believe that a large prosperity would attend the labours of such an Association, so securing the co-operation of native Africans. Would it not be, then, worse than folly if a foolish, ignorant fear of the word ""monopoly"" were permitted to stand in the way of operations that would at the same time be carrying forward the work which God seems to have appointed Great Britain to do for the recovery of Africa from its misery and degradation, and helping to support those institutions under which she has attained to a position of unexampled wealth and power? We have shown the intimate relation which exists between the development of the resources of the world\'s rich and fertile, but now fruitless wastes, and the prosperity of Great Britain, the contentment of its people, and the stability of its institutions. It is not, therefore, in any way unreasonable that we should suggest, that if it be objected to our proposal of a subsidy to the Upper Gambia Association of 5,000l. per annum out of the Gambia revenues, that it would not be possible to effect such retrenchments or economies at Bathurst as should make it possible to furnish such a subsidy from such source, the Imperial Treasury should guarantee and pay such subsidy, as a loan secured on the Gambia revenues, until the certain augmentation of the latter by means of the operations of the Association, and of the generally increased development of the resources of the River, should render the continuance of such loans no longer necessary. Five thousand pounds a year would be a charge on the Imperial revenue so paltry when applied to the furtherance of a great object, even though it were an absolute charge and not a mere loan amply secured even by existing revenue—a charge per annum amounting to but little more than the expense incurred by two or three experimental discharges of the monster Woolwich gun—that we do not think it necessary to say more in support or defence of such a suggestion. It is impossible, as we have already said, to dissociate the enduring interests of Great Britain from those of her Colonies and Settlements abroad. They are one and the same, though they may differ in degree. The wealth of Great Britain has not been gained by the exchange among themselves by her people of the fruits of their several labours,—this alone would never have created it; it has been the profitable exchange of her surplus of manufactured productions for the productions of her Colonies and other parts of the world, and other foreign operations, that have made her the richest of all countries; and her only safety lies in the continuance of similar profitable operations. Our demand is, therefore, still the same as in our May number—an Association for settlements and trade in the Upper Gambia, under Government subsidy, with such exclusive rights as would be indispensable to the success of its operations. And we would, and do, entreat those merchants at present engaged in the Gambia trade to settle among themselves the basis of such an Association, with their several interests in it, in order that the matter may be brought before Her Majesty\'s Government in such a form as would insure the success of their application for the necessary powers and subsidy.'}, {'id': 3723, 'article_title': 'ROADS MUST BE MADE ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'ROADS MUST BE MADE ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_02_1879', 'content': '\n\nAdministrator after Administrator, has vied with his predecessors in efforts to ""keep things quiet;"" the most advisable mode of doing which has been to eat up all the revenue in salaries and expenses, leaving no fund whatever for the improvements indispensable for developing those resources of the countries on which commerce depends for existence.

A great colonial empire like ours could not stand still. As an Englishman he refused to believe that the time had come when Great Britain was to go downhill. If free trade was to remain our motto, fresh markets and new developments were a necessity. It was our destiny to open up the uncivilised world, for none could do it so successfully as we. Our history in the building up of Greater Britain, in America, Australia, India, and South Africa, proved that we were the colonising nation of the world. To summarise: The country was fertile, its climate temperate, the soil good, the natural products not inferior to those of other countries—some of them, like ivory, were of extreme value. Could any undeveloped country show more? This country might turn out a successful commercial venture or it might be a failure. He knew not. One thing he did know. A company was formed numbering among its leading men names honoured where the English language was spoken, and received a Charter from her Majesty. Urged by public opinion, if not by direct Government incentive, it deputed him to go to Uganda and to offer protection to the peoples of those countries in return for a treaty with them. He did as he was directed. With no small difficulty some progress had been made. At present order reigned where faction and bitterness were before. Our withdrawal meant leaving all to chaos—a worse chaos than we found. Were we now to turn back? Should we, a nation who claimed the foremost rank in colonisation and civilisation, be less careful of our national honour, and grudge a sum so paltry as that which would save the situation in Uganda and in British East Africa. Within the last few days the decision of the Government with regard to Uganda had been made known. It was that the Company would be allowed to carry out their resolve of evacuation, but a commissioner from the Government would report on the position of affairs, and upon him would devolve the responsibility that order was maintained. This was the earnest of a more complete responsibility, the responsibility of direct administration, and it devolved upon them to support the Government in the course they had taken, to show them that that course had the approval of the nation, and to strengthen their hands in that policy which alone we judge to be worthy our national honour and our traditions as a nation.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Commercial Value of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Altogether our West African possessions do a trade with Great Britain (mainly with Liverpool, London, and Bristol) of about £5,000,000 yearly, give honourable employment to some 770 of our British fellow-countrymen, and bring at least 5,000,000 of intelligent (Sierra Leone), sturdy (Krumen), industrious (Gold Coast), artistic (Yoruba), brave (Niger), good-tempered (Oil Rivers) negroes under our sway. I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'West Africa is one of the richest mineral regions on the planet, and England has been given an entrance to it for the purpose of spreading a civilisation and Christianity that will not do harm to the cause of the Gospel or bring disgrace on morality. The Mohammedan traders on the west coast of Sierra Leone, when asked where they get their precious metals and fine work, turn round and point to the north-east—Segoo, Bambara. Why have we not been in Bambara years ago? A light railway should have been run up to the north-east. The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers. They are tapping all that rich region while we remain inert.\n\nWest Africa has, from interested motives, been represented as unhealthy for Europeans. This illusion is being rapidly dispelled by disinterested travellers. The Englishman, through unhealthy habits, may dig his own grave even in England, as so many thousands do annually. Besides, were London as innocent of sanitary arrangements as Freetown, it would soon become the white man\'s grave in grim reality. A man unaddicted to drink and gluttony may live, and does live, an enjoyable life in West Africa; he enjoys it so much that, like Emin Pasha, he refuses to be rescued. Officers and others have told me they preferred being out there for a time, not only because they liked the life, but because ""dear old Cox"" has been able to transfer the balance of their account from the debit to the credit side.\n\nWest Africa is the coming country; it teems with wealth; it is within easy distance of this country, and can be brought within six days of the London market if necessary. All that we require to do is to get rid of the drink, open out the country as honest people, and make room for our surplus population, from the nobleman\'s son down to the humblest artisan and labourer. There is fibre there for our manufacturers of Lancashire and Yorkshire; there is gold, silver, copper, coal, precious stones, ivory, india-rubber, nitrate, indigo, antimony, guano, palm oil, kola, ebony, mahogany, gum-copal, potash, ginger, gum, iron, farinaceous foods, dye woods, tanning material, spices, coffee, tobacco, cocoa, cotton, and other produce. Some of these vegetable products grow wild. Horses, camels, and sheep, can be bred in the north-east. The list of articles to be found on the coast reads like the inventory of a Liverpool warehouse. The wealth of West Africa is simply boundless, illimitable. It confirms Lord Palmerston\'s prediction of it in 1860, when he said that it ""would be a source of wealth, not to Europe only, but to the world, to such an extent that imagination itself could hardly follow it.""', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.724, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of Tropical Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. H. H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised.

These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export.

They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites.

Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done.

This term is in contradistinction to the Upper Niger, from Timbuctoo to the sources, which runs for a distance of 1,000 miles at the back of the French colony of Senegal, and which has been visited by several French exploring parties, though as yet no European trade has been opened there. Nor, indeed, can such trade be carried on profitably until the completion of the railway connecting the waterways of the Senegal and the Upper Niger. Between the latter and the Niger-Binue lies the long stretch of the Middle Niger, from Timbuctoo to Boussa; nature thus interposing a barrier of 800 miles between the Upper Niger basin, which will probably fall to France, and the Niger-Binue basin, which is already occupied by Great Britain. The Niger-Binue was unknown to Europe fifty-five years ago. The wildest theories were held as to the ultimate destination of the Niger—some geographers holding that it was absorbed by an inland sea, others that it fell into the Nile, others that it joined the Congo. The English traveller, John Lander, in 1831 solved the problem by starting from Badagry, and travelling northwards till he reached the Niger, near Boussa, where are the lowest rapids, and where commences the Niger-Binue system. He followed the river down 600 miles to the sea. Immediately on his return home, in 1832, his great discovery was turned to account by some Liverpool merchants, who despatched two steamers to nearly the highest navigable point on the Niger, and to Dagbo on the Binue. Numerous private expeditions from this country followed in the years 1834 to 1864, the most notable event being the formation in 1852 of the African Steamship Company, which established a line to Lokoga at the confluence of the Niger and Binue, 300 miles from the sea. Meanwhile the British Government had made efforts to open up both branches, and to lay down charts. Under an impulse given by Prince Consort, Parliament voted over £50,000 for the expedition of Her Majesty’s ships Albert, Wilberforce, and Soudan, during which the Government obtained the cession of a large tract of country about the confluence at Lokoga, where the British flag flies to this day. Another important expedition was that of 1854-5, during which were laid down most careful charts of the Binue for some hundreds of miles. In 1857 Parliament voted a five years' subsidy, averaging £7,000 a year, to Mr. Macgregor Laird, to assist him in developing trade in these rivers, and it was expressly stated on that occasion that immediate results could not be expected, but that posterity would reap the benefit. In a letter dated the 29th April, 1864, Earl Russell stated that he was willing to recommend a further subsidy of £6,000 for the same object. The proposal fell through—indeed, was rendered unnecessary by the springing up of British trade, which has lasted to the present day."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH INDUSTRY IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African Lakes Company took shape in 1878, to assist the various missions then established, and to work out Livingstone\'s schemes.

Twenty-five Europeans are dotted about at trading stations stretching from Quillimane on the coast to a point half-way between the Lakes Nyassa and Tanganyika. These stations are twelve in number, and three steamers ply on lake and river with great regularity. The company has shown itself equal to conveying a steam vessel in sections across from Lake Nyassa, and she is now on Lake Tanganyika with the staff of the London Missionary Society. But the point which the company has settled is this: It has proved that it is possible to trade in India-rubber, wax, oilseeds, and ivory to an enormous amount, without defiling the list of their barter goods with a single keg of trade rum, or the all-representative ""square face"" of the West Coast trade. Messrs. Moir, who are intrusted with the concerns of the company, testify that they have already exported (December, 1885) 40,815lb. of ivory, and not imported a glass of spirits.\n\nLittle short of romantic are some of the incidents connected with the company\'s progress. Two little stunted coffee plants led a miserable existence in the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens. Mr. John Moir took them away with him to the Shire highlands. In due time they arrived; the fittest survived, took a new lease of life, struck deep roots into the warm, red soil of the hills, and burst out with berries and cuttings in the glorious air of the highlands. The gardens on Mount Zomba are a thing to see, and some years since samples of their produce were priced very highly in Mincing-lane. To this patriarch of the Edinburgh Gardens is every berry traceable, and it is computed that 100,000 trees claim direct descent from him. Nothing seems such a favourite article of barter with the natives as soap; and the Lakes Company contemplate making both soap and candles for the market which already exists. The company pride themselves on the alteration they are bringing about in the ivory trade of the interior. It has been the custom of the Arabs to buy, or to seize, such stores of ivory as they know of in the country. The tusks are borne to the coast by slaves, who after a tramp of several hundred miles are got rid of for what they will fetch. The burden the man has carried may bring in from £25 to £30; the bearer may change hands for £1.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'British Trade in North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The success of the gold fields of South Africa is serving to  \ndraw attention to the Gold Coast as another source of produc-  \ntion of the precious metal; and as special reports of the gold  \nmines of that country have recently been made by the Governor,  \nit is evident that the authorities have been desirous of gaining  \nfurther knowledge, or reassuring themselves, with the presumed  \nobject of stimulating enterprise.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

As only men could \'see the gold and kill it\', the system of division of labour in force assigned men the tasks of prospecting, digging, and crushing quartz, while women were responsible for orecarrying and washing operations. By the end of the century, the proportion of slaves among such communities was substantial (sixty per family in the village of Pura).51 The noteworthy feature here is that these were family or individual enterprises, unrelated to any centralized state. The Zamberma invasion led the peasantry in some villages in the gold-bearing district to conceal their implements in the hills and go on to a war footing; captured men were sold for 100 000 cowries, and women captives for double that sum.

But clearly the contribution of minerals to colonial economies has been greatly exaggerated.

In Northern Rhodesia, copper was mined from 1910, but it was not until the late 1920s when the mines came into full production that minerals made an appreciable impression on the export sector. From 1931 minerals contributed over 50% of the total value of domestic exports. The proportion increased considerably in subsequent years. In Sierra Leone mining started late, but by 1935 minerals contributed over 50% of domestic exports. In 1936 mineral exports in British dependencies of tropical Africa stood in the following order of importance: Northern Rhodesia, £5094000; Southern Rhodesia, £4422000; Gold Coast, £2124213 and Sierra Leone, £1245000.

But the limited nature of African participation should guide our assessment. Mining was established with foreign capital, and profits accruing from the industry were repatriated to swell the pockets of shareholders abroad, or to develop economies outside Africa. For instance, when the Charter of the Niger Company was revoked in 1899, the company was compensated £150000 for its mining rights in the region where tin mining was later established. According to the same agreement, the company was to receive as much as 50% of all royalties from mining for ninety-nine years.$^{59}$ This was a very heavy price for the local population to pay, but the situation was even worse in the Rhodesias, where mining rights remained in the hands of the British South Africa Company until 1933 when they were purchased by the state for £2 000 000.$^{60}$ But even after this change the local population was rarely regarded, and even more rarely treated, as the beneficiaries of mining operations.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this.

There were, however, some important variations from colony to colony in each region.\nIn Uganda and to a lesser extent Tanganyika, most of the fertile land was owned by the indigenous population, the Africans. With a few ex› ceptions, for example Buganda in Uganda, the Bukoba and Kilimanjaro areas in Tanganyika and Gikuyuland in Kenya, land did not acquire market value on a large scale, and it was held communally. Every member of the community had the right to land. In most cases it was labour, and not land, which was the scarcer means of production.\nForeigners, mostly British, secured and held concessions on land with mineral and timber resources, but such arrangements had little adverse effect on the local agricultural communities.

In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories.

In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio.

From Monrovia to the Gambia, the Sudanic zone only began to have contacts with the sea coast in the eighteenth century.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'South Africa, 1880-1935', 'content': ""Not only the economy but the society of South Africa underwent a revolutionary change during the last three decades of the nineteenth cen- tury. This was primarily because of one single event, the discovery of minerals, first of diamonds in Griqualand in 1867 and Kimberley in 1870, and then of gold in Transvaal in 1886. Within five years of the discovery in Griqualand, more than £1.6 million-worth of diamonds was being annually exported. This had increased to more than £5 million by 1880, that is more than the total value of all the other exports of South Africa. 94 By 1899 De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd had emerged 'to reorganize mining as a highly capitalized and concentrated modern industry, employ› ing the latest scientific techniques, and establishing a world monopoly of sales through the London Diamond Syndicates'$^{95}$ and the value of diamonds exported continued to rise. By 1905, it was about £10 million and by 1910 over £15 million. Even more rapid was the growth of the gold mining industry after its discovery in 1886. By 1890 £10 million-worth of gold was being exported which made gold the leading South African export; this had risen to £25 million by 1905 and to between £45 and £50 million by 1910.\nThe effects of this mining boom in South Africa were truly phenomenal and all-embracing. Politically, the discovery of diamonds led first to the annexation of the Kimberley area, then Transvaal itself in 1877, and finally to the conquest of Zululand in 1879 after the humiliating defeat of the British at Isandhlwana. Both also contributed to the first Anglo-Boer war of 1881, which was won by the Boers. Similarly, the discovery of gold led to the annexation of all the African states south of the Limpopo river, the Jameson Raid of 1896, and finally the Second Boer War of 1899 which ultimately resulted in the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.

That South Africa should have led here is not surprising for, as Houghton has pointed out, Griqualand from being 'a forgotten no-man's-land inhabited by a few hundred Griqua under their chief Waterboer', thanks to the discovery of diamonds, 'suddenly became a focus of world interest'.$^{97}$ The discovery of gold did the same thing for the Transvaal and the areas south of the Limpopo river.\nEqually revolutionary was the impact of the mining industry on the provision of infrastructure in South Africa. The huge distances between settlements and towns - Johannesburg is 1540 km from Cape Town and the sparseness of the population had hitherto ruled out the construction of railways as a viable proposition. But the discovery of gold and diamonds made railways and roads not only necessary but also practical. It is not surprising then that railway construction began in the 1870s from different points - Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban - all leading first to the diamond fields and then after 1886 into the Transvaal. The length of railway line rose from no km by 1869 to 1700 km by 1889, 3300 km by 1899 and 4190 km by 1905 (see Fig. 16.4).$^{98}$ Side by side with railways went the construction of roads.

As there is good reason to believe that the Kong Mountains, and thence to the Gold Coast, constitute by far the richest gold field on the face of the known earth, and as it so happens that in this hour of England's need—at this time, when the culminating experience and evidence of years proves beyond dispute that her vast interests, and the vast interests of the civilized and semi-civilized world dependent on her, are suffering and endangered because the present gold supply is not adequate to the world's needs—as it so happens, we say, that at this time the wretched savage of Ashanti, who, with his blood-thirsty hordes, rules over, depopulates, and keeps unproductive that vast source of gold supply, has forced upon them the national duty of chastising his insolence and destroying his powers for evil, does it not manifestly become the duty of the British Government so to prosecute the war which has now begun, that we may obtain permanent control over those rich countries; and utilize for our own and the whole civilized world's good those supplies of gold with which Providence has endowed them? It seems to us incontestable that if the capitalists and people of this country understood their true interests, they would besiege the Government with demands that the Ashanti War Expedition should be so organized, impelled, and reinforced if necessary, that a speedy and effectual occupation of Ashanti shall be obtained. There is reason to believe that, from the richness of that gold field, and the abundant native labour to be obtained for working it under European direction, the product would far exceed that ever yet obtained from any known gold field hitherto worked. Suppose, and it is perfectly reasonable, that twenty millions sterling per annum be obtained; this would give, and we doubt if anything short of this would give, the relief of which we stand in need. What a spectacle for the last quarter of the nineteenth century it will be, if England die for gold, when she had only to stretch out the arm of her power over the barbarous, easily accessible country of Ashanti to obtain it. If Great Britain die—and she is in danger of dying now for want of gold—if she die, with that supply which Ashanti can be made to furnish, within view, within her power, and unappropriated—she will merit her fate of being interred in the world's highway as a deliberate suicide.""}, {'id': 3822, 'article_title': 'West and North-west Africa for Gold', 'full_section_title': 'West and North-west Africa for Gold', 'last_edit_date': '07-24-1879', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1879#article-13', 'issue_date': '01_08_1879', 'content': 'Sir,—The deficiency of production of gold in the world now amounts to 15,000,000l.; in other words, the former production has fallen off that large amount. So says Earl Beaconsfield, and we have every reason to believe he is correct. Well, if his lordship and the rest of the Government have faith in their opinions, why do they not seek to open up fresh sources of the precious metal? In Africa there are large extents of gold-bearing country which have but to be properly worked to equal those of the past in California and Australia. Take a map of Africa, follow up the course of the Gambia River to its head-waters, go east from there about 100 to 200 miles, and you cross the countries of Dentilia and Neola. Now these countries have, years ago, sent large quantities of gold to the West Coast, but since the roads became unsafe, it has been sent east—to Sego, on the Upper Niger, from whence it finds its way to Morocco, across the desert. The gold in these districts is found in surface diggings and sand washings; but the quartz reefs are untouched, also pocket digging is unknown. Now, run your finger east, to the bend of the Upper Niger, in longitude 4 west, and latitude 17½ north, to the north of which Timbuctoo is situated. Well, on the south or right bank of that bend of the Niger, and about 120 miles west of Timbuctoo, is the Jimballa country, which extends south-west as far as Lake Debu. This country is very rich in gold, and though only surface or washing diggings are attempted, yet supplies Timbuctoo and a large portion of the interior with gold for home use, and also for export. Were European enterprise brought to bear on these countries, the gold return would be enormous, for what is now neglected or wasted would be utilized. Pass, now, about south-west, and we come to the Kong mountains, and we come again to gold-bearing reefs and streams; further south and west, we come to the rich Wassaw range, which is the only one where European enterprise has begun to act. Yet all these places ought to be of easy reach from England. In fourteen days we can reach the head of the Gambia from England; in fourteen days more we can reach Dentilia, even by the slow mode of caravan travel; and if British commerce were established at Sego, on the Upper Niger, we could reach the gold fields of Jimballa in eight days by water from that place, and tap the markets there _via_ Gambia and Sego.

As we have endeavoured, by God\'s help, to do our duty in the one, so do we fully purpose, in humble and trustful reliance on the same assistance, to do it in the other. The interests of humanity are a rapidly swelling tide, rolling onward without ebb to the futurity of which we all vainly desire to fathom the great mysteries. All that we know is that with every succeeding year the unknown becomes more and more vast in importance as regards the great human family and its destinies. The rapidly increasing populations of the civilized world—the new millions that are arriving, all of whom will want to dip their buckets in the stream, and obtain from it the greatest possible amount of gratification and of good, appear before our mental vision, struggling on the crowded banks of the great river of Time, and every unit there must have its influence for good or evil. But that we have an unswerving faith in a divine overruling Providence, the great problems looming in the future would overwhelm us by their magnitude; and it is an unspeakable relief to feel that the ultimate issues are all appointed by a wisdom that cannot err, and a benevolence that never slumbers or sleeps. Following the shrewd American advice, ""never to prophecy where you do not know,"" we shall certainly not attempt prophecy, resting satisfied with those glorious predictions that gem the pages of Holy Writ. The most that we allow ourselves is to reason on the probable and possible influence of current events and discoveries, and endeavour, according to the vulgar adage, to see a little way before our noses. In this ""little way"" we fancy we see portentous changes from agencies mightily at work on every side. We cannot believe in the stability of ""peace"" within the limits of the civilized world, while we glance at the ever-swelling armaments of the Great Powers; while we see the tenacity with which selfish interests, long in the ascendant, cling to their supposed rights; while we behold a surging flood of humanity ready to overleap the barriers within which it has been confined, unless some safe channels be opened for its flow. It may be that the ameliorations that indefatigable Science is constantly introducing may open such channels, and thus retard or avert great catastrophes. We are always inclined to err rather on the side of hope than of despondency—to anticipate coming good rather than evil, and if thoughts of evil will come, to look through that evil to a future good. We try to see Ireland pacified, whether by a new St. Patrick ""driving the modern frogs into the bogs, and banishing all the varmint,"" or by persistently upholding the banner of justice and equity for all, loosing the fetters of pecuniary oppression, and thus, by the creation of a satisfied and prosperous agricultural population, rendering unprofitable the trade of the loud-mouthed sham philanthropists and patriots. Knowing how great were the wrongs it ostensibly sought to redress—the evils it ostensibly sought to remove—we had up to a certain point a sympathy with the Irish Land League, experience having proved that no remedial measures were ever adopted in that unhappy country except as concessions to agitation. But when the greatest measure of modern times was adopted in the teeth of class interests, and this was answered by pretended patriots with the ""No Rent"" proclamation, which strikes at the root of all social order and all legal right, we could have nothing left but condemnation of selfish cravings for a most pernicious popularity. We try to see its greatly injured king restored to Zululand; the wrongs of the Basutos redressed, and peace and security again reigning in their land; the Transvaal devoting itself to those measures of internal improvement, and for improved external communications, which seem to be alone wanting to make that territory one of the favoured ones of the earth. We try to see, as we thirst to see, the way more clearly preparing in the East for the return of Israel and Judah to the lands given to Abraham as a perpetual inheritance for his seed, when Judea shall become a joy and pride among the nations. We try to see, and believe we do see, the commencement of the first railway in West Africa, giving an impetus to the progress of civilization and Christianity among those populations for whose advancement and interests we have so long laboured—populations suffering under the sanguinary despotism of fetid superstitions. We try to see a true love of Africa and of its race, and not merely devotion to their own particular selfish interests and enjoyments, stimulating and urging to philanthropic and Christian exertion those first fruits of British Christian philanthropy who are now fitted, by education and general acquirements, to take their stand intellectually among their white brethren in these favoured European lands. When we take a retrospective view of West Africa at the beginning of the present century, and compare it with what it is now, we can only exclaim, ""What hath God wrought!"" We feel sure that we see a great extension and advancement in gold mining industry within the protected territories of the Gold Coast—an industry which is to spread later to those mystical Kong Mountains, which have been pouring forth from their solitude streams of their wondrous wealth, northward and southward, to the countries of the Gambia and the Senegal, and to the ocean shores of the Gold Coast. We are patient, but we do thirst for a geological and mineralogical survey of the southern slopes of those mountains, and an exploration of the entire range. It may be that there will be found grand deposits, not only of gold (which we know to exist there), but of those precious stones (none of which have ever yet been found in West Africa) which are making South Africa so famous in the world, and of other precious gems in which the ""Beauty"" and ""Vanity"" of the world delight. We hope to see the British Government become sensible of the great value of its West African possessions, and embarking in a course of improvement, more especially by the introduction of better facilities of communication with the interior and along the coast line, so that officials and others moving from one town on the coast to another shall not be exposed to perils such as that by which poor Mr. Woodcock, the Queen\'s Advocate, has lately lost his life. Our desires for the extension of British authority along the coast, not with a view to national aggrandizement, but for the benefit, improvement, and Christian civilization of the natives, are so well known that we need not enlarge upon them here; and we hope to see these realized, or at least a commencement of them made, in 1882.'}, {'id': 6218, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': '06-01-1892', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_06_1892', 'content': 'The direction of English West African trade is now turning towards the openings presented by the 700 miles of Liberian coast through which the interior may be reached.

The hot climate is tempered by constantly alternating breezes from the land and from the sea. The year is divided into dry and rainy seasons, of which the dry season begins in November and lasts until June, when heavy rains begin. From the coast the land rises rapidly towards the interior, and the temperature diminishes in the\n**[JUNE 1, 1892.]**\n\nproportion of one degree to every 750ft. of altitude.

In the lower of the two a number of small streams take their rise, and in the rainy season become flooded and carry with them to the sea enormous masses of vegetable and mineral detritus. The second terrace is known by the name of the Kong Mountains. There gold mines are believed to exist, and a number of streams take their rise, and form fine rivers on their way to the sea. The country is at all points penetrable by these watercourses. The opportunities which they offer for navigation rendered this part of the coast a hotbed of the slave trade, and now the same advantages may serve to stimulate the development of legitimate commerce. The native products consist chiefly of palm oil, camwood, ivory, and gold dust. Rice, sugar, coffee, cocoa, indigo, cotton, ginger, cassava, and potatoes are all indigenous to the soil, and many kinds of grain flourish amazingly. What resources the back country may offer in the way of a native market and how much truth there is in the reports of mineral wealth existing in the Kong Mountains remain to be demonstrated by experience.

It is believed that the Greeks received gold from these parts 2,900 years ago. Of recent times our first African traveller, Mungo Park, proved the existence of gold north of the Kong Mountain, and described the methods by which gold was won by the Natives; a plan similar to that adopted by the Natives south of the same range. The present gold supply comes from Ashanti, and possibly the bulk of it from Wassau. A little over 40 years ago our principal supply came from the Gold Coast; but when California and Australia came to the front as gold producers, the Gold Coast was to a great extent lost sight of. Since the first supply of gold in 1471, the total amount received from West Africa has been estimated by Captain Burton at £600,000,000, an amount not in the least exaggerated, I should say, when we take into account the regular yearly returns made for a period exceeding 200 years. Other authorities estimate that in the space of 40 years no less an amount than £200,000,000 could have been received. The surface soil in some parts of the country seems to be full of gold; it has been found on the sea beach, in rivers, and even washed from the gutters of the streets of the small towns after rain. Rich mines are found in Gaman and Wassau, the principal gold fields being on the Wassau range. Expeditions have been made from time to time, and quite recently discoveries are reported from the north-west part of the Colony. Such work is slow; the country is covered with dense forest, which makes progress in travelling and surface examinations difficult. As there is traditionally great wealth in the Kong mountains, it would seem wise to construct a line of rails through the country with the object of tapping this region. We are met with the suggestion that it would be a worthless undertaking from the point of trade. This, however, is problematic.

We do not say that the public are altogether to blame. The Press and the Stock Exchange were studiously worked to win favour for the East Indian Gold Mines, while the few West African Companies have done little or nothing to make the public acquainted with those which they are working, and which have throughout given promise of far higher results than are likely to be obtained in India. *Prima facie* evidence was altogether in favour of the West African Gold Mines. It was certainly not a high estimate that from seven to eight hundred millions of pounds sterling value of gold had come into Europe during four centuries, the whole being the produce of alluvial washings and surface mining — *i.e.*, mining in pits, for the most part, under thirty or forty feet in depth, where they were stopped either by rain or mine waters; and if such quantities of gold, to say nothing of the considerable quantity retained by the natives as ornaments or family fortunes (for the most part buried under the soil of their huts), the lodes from which these treasures have proceeded cannot fail to reward mining operations scientifically conducted.

They are, in places, very numerous, and travellers have to pick their way lest they should fall into them, as they are more like pitfalls than mines, sometimes being partly over-grown. These shafts are very straight, and have no timbers; holes are cut into the sides of the shafts to allow the Natives to descend and ascend.

Even now our knowledge of them is very imperfect, their thorough exploration being impeded by climatic and physiographic influences. In a country, of which the greater part of the surface consists of swamps overgrown with mangrove forests, and which is rendered impenetrable by the luxuriance of the vegetation, geological and geographical studies are rendered all but impossible, whilst the absence of mountains prevents the traveller from obtaining a clear idea of the general configuration. The surface of the country presents a series of flat swampy plains, copiously watered by rivers and streams, and intersected by chains of hills gradually increasing in elevation as we recede from the sea-coast towards the interior, the said chains of hills being, very roughly, parallel to the average trend of the coast. Having regard to the large annual rainfall (about 60 in.), to the exceeding softness of the rocks, and the great sinuosities of the river, as well as to the general surface contour, no geologist can doubt that we have here a well marked example of a low plateau, from which hills have been produced simply by subaerial denudation, the harder portions having resisted the influence of the aqueous action which has worn the softer parts into hollows and valleys. In many cases, the hills owe their existence to a quartz reef which they enclose, and which has formed the backbone of the hill; a confirmation of this theory may be found in the fact that the northern slope of the hills is usually far steeper than the southern, the enclosed reef dipping to the south. The country rock is in most cases a non-stratified and but slightly indurated clay rock, resting upon soft blue slates, at times schistose; but in the present imperfect state of our geological knowledge of this region this statement must be regarded as conjectural rather than conclusive. The writer has never himself seen a single fossil that might aid in fixing the geological epoch of this formation, nor has he ever heard of such having been found, and is disposed to regard it as modern, geologically speaking. Round the bases of these low hillocks, and covering some of the more elevated plains, are deposits of non-consolidated gravels which are occasionally auriferous. These have been and are worked by the natives, especially on the banks of the smaller streams, tributaries of the river Ancobra, which intersects and forms the main highway of communication between the various gold mining concessions and the coast. Hitherto, none of these auriferous deposits have been found sufficiently rich to repay the attention which various European explorers have directed towards them, though there is no reason why such should not be discovered, especially towards the interior. The main wealth of the region lies in its deposits of gold quartz, which have been and are now worked by various mining companies.

Bonnat, the enterprising Manager of the African Gold Coast Company in Africa, has passed through London since we published our last number. We have never concealed that the climate of West Africa is proverbially a bad one, and we were therefore curious to see what effect it had on M. Bonnat, who had been three years resident in Tacquah at the mines, and we cannot help being much impressed by the result. We may truly say he shows no trace of deterioration by climate. He says it is a vile climate, and requires great prudence, caution, self-restraint, and watchfulness on the part of Europeans residing there; but he agrees with our view that as the country becomes disforested by mining operations, the climate will improve. That, although dangerous, it is not necessarily fatal, is proved by the fact that although there are thirteen Europeans on the staff of the French Company, there has not been a case of death, save of one man who literally and deliberately killed himself. This is gratifying, as it points, we think and hope, to a not distant time when climate will scarcely have to be at all taken into account in our calculations. We would not have our readers form the erroneous idea that all the gold formations in the West African gold fields are precisely of the same character as those of Tacquah and Abosso. We do not yet know how much further north that peculiar formation may extend, but in the line from and including the French Company's Abosso mine, mentioned in our last, and one or two concessions N.N.W. of that, the formation seems clearly to have been in the course of some old river-bed, and the gold-bearing veins or lodes are of disintegrated quartz, in scarcely any of which does gold appear to the naked eye, even when the assay has been as high as thirty-three to thirty-four ounces of gold to the ton of ore. This formation extends, as we have said, from the N.N.W. points above indicated through the Tacquah district, including Aboutuyakoon, the Gold Coast Mining Company's mines, those of the African Gold Coast Company, those of the Effuenta Company, and the Tamsoo and Merivoo Mines to the River Bonza, and in a direct line S.S.W. toward the sea-coast. This line does not include, we believe, the mines being worked or about to be worked by Messrs. F. and A. Swanzy, which are on a hill outside it. Glorious specimens have, we believe, as stated in an earlier number, been taken from this mine, but, according to description (we have not personally seen them), they are of gold-bearing, hard, natural quartz, not disintegrated quartz, approaching in character to that of the East India mines now in such great favour, on which beautiful deposits of gold from time to time appear, very striking to the eye when compared with the disintegrated quartz lodes, with their invisible though rich continuous gold. We think it right to mention this essential difference, not that we have any reason to believe the high expectations formed of the gold yield of that natural quartz will in any way disappoint the high expectations formed of it, because we have the firm conviction that this quartz in West Africa is ten times richer than that to be found in any of the so-much-boasted-of East Indian mines.

The lode in tunnel and shaft much the same as last week; _still keep very rich_. I have a fine pile of rich ore at surface, and have begun to carry valuable stones to your house. I have opened in shaft and tunnel about 70 feet on the course of the lode, and so far I find the strata in its proper position; _no fault, no slide_, to cause any interruption in the lode. On this I rely, in confidence that the lode will keep good and rich. I am very anxious to hole from tunnel to shaft, making all progress I possibly can. We can talk to each other from tunnel to shaft, so you see the distance is not very great.""\n\n### NO. II.\n\n""August 8, 1881.—I am making all progress I possibly can with the underground work. I expect to get a hole from shaft to tunnel early next week. _The shaft still keeps very rich._ The south end in tunnel much the same as last week—very good—unchanged. _North end very much improved._ I cut a centre, forming a junction in the main lode of this north end, and on the side of this junction _I have a much richer lode_. I wish I could just hand you a stone from this end.""\n\n### DEPUTY-MANAGER TO SECRETARY.\n\n""August 15, 1881.—North Tunnel.—We are working hard getting out the ore, which, I am pleased to say, _still continues to show richer_. It is undoubtedly the richest lode that has yet been seen in this country, and quite uniform in its width—viz., 28 feet. In most of it the gold can be seen plainly all over the surface.

With the imperfect information we at present possess, we are not able to form any reliable opinion as to whether the rumour of war, or the war itself, should it take place (which we do not at all believe), would temporarily affect the interests of the mining Companies, by interfering with the progress of their works. We see no reason why it should do so, except the reason of ""panic,"" which may not impossibly lead to the retreat of the working staff to Axim until the trouble shall have passed away. Our opinions as to this trouble will be found in our leader on the subject. One thing however, is quite certain—namely, that even if it should temporarily affect in some prejudicial way the interests of the several Mining Companies working in Wassaw, it cannot have any permanent ill results. Those results seem to us, to be as well assured as any mining operations can be. The more we examine into and consider the evidence we possess, the more strongly are we convinced that the opinions we have hitherto expressed as to the great success that must attend those mining operations, if well conducted—the more strongly, we say, are we convinced that these Wassaw Gold Mines will within a short time stand forth pre-eminently at the head of all the gold mining operations now organized for various parts of the world. We have been comparing the Effuenta, for instance, with the ""Potosi,"" the prospectus of which lately convulsed the speculative mining market for a few hours, and we have no hesitation in saying that if the ""Potosi"" was worth, to purchase, 250,000l., with founders\' shares to be redeemed by another 100,000l., the sum for which it was purchased from the vendors, then the ""Effuenta,"" or the African Gold Coast, at present, and the Gold Coast Mining later, are worth 500,000l., or half a million each. The value of the Effuenta ore-bed does not seem to be yet exactly ascertained, but it is certainly equal to that of the African Gold Coast, and we see no reason whatever to doubt the truth and accuracy of M. Verillon\'s (the managing director) report as regards this: that by indiscriminate samples taken by him personally from three of the stoping grounds, the value of the ore in their ore-bed was and is 5l. 4s. per ton of ore; that they expect it richer at lower depths to which they are going; and that the mine, as opened, will be capable of being worked up to a production of 100 tons of ore per day, while the quantity is such that the mine would not be exhausted in a century. As we have said above, what the African Gold Coast Company\'s mine thus described is, so is the Effuenta Mine, at least, and so, at least, will be the Gold Coast Mining Company\'s mine; and we reaffirm that if the Potosi is worth what was paid for it, each of these is worth half a million.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West African Gold Mines', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following interesting letter appears in the *Mining Journal* of Feb. 5:—\n\nSir,—I have been surprised that these West African properties have not been brought to the front during the present excitement in gold mining affairs, for that the gold is there is beyond all question. I do not forget that several of the companies which started a few years ago came to grief, but the cause of this was well known to be mismanagement and misfortune—forces which would ruin the best scheme in the world. But that these are going to prevent success in West Africa for ever I fail to believe. Let us look for a moment at what has really been going on quietly during the past twelve months there; and I think we shall see cause for much hopefulness in the near future. The Wassau Mining Company\'s monthly report is now before me. The crushing for twenty-two days in November gave 232 ozs., which netted the sum of £894 19s. in London, after deducting freight and expenses. This is at the rate of £1,220 per month of thirty days. Their monthly expenses, I believe, are now somewhere about £500. This shows a profit at the rate of over £8,000 a-year, or 8 per cent on the capital, and much more than this is a mere question of machinery. The manager reports on December 1: ""If anything, the mine looks better than ever."" The French Company have reorganised their affairs, and a large and able staff left England on January 1. Their property, at a depth of 40 ft., gives an average yield of 17½ dwts. per ton in a south-west direction, and in a north-east direction it gives 21 dwts. At 63 ft. it gives 2 ozs. 15 dwts., and in Bonnat\'s shaft, at 83 ft., it yields 5 ozs. 13 dwts. per ton. With figures like these, one may fairly ask, where are the East Indian mines? Where, even, are the Queensland properties? The Swanzy Estates Company, a private enterprise, carefully and economically managed, have been working for upwards of two years on a property which, though not so rich as the others, is none the less likely to pay handsomely, as the quantity of mineral in sight is enormous, and it can be worked at a mere nominal cost, in consequence of its position.

These companies have not had the advantage, if it be an advantage, of feeding the public mind with sensational telegrams, such as have been sent in a strong current from the East Indies, but have worked on quietly in the assurance that they would gratify their shareholders eventually by a great success. The vendors from whom the companies have derived their mines having taken their payment almost entirely in shares, instead of chiefly in money, as in the case of the East India mines, the companies were not in a position to fulfil the requirements of the Stock Exchange, so as to obtain a quotation in the official lists.

In spite of their reputation for conservatism, all pastoral groups were drawn into the money economy by the 1920s, if not earlier. They sold meat for local consumption and occasionally for export along with hides. In the territories that were to become Somalia, this was the principal manifestation of the colonial economy. Fishing peoples were similarly affected. Trade in the traditional item of dried and smoked fish, like trade in meat and other foodstuffs, became dependent upon the cash of the main export earners, and sensitively reflected the seasonal buying power of peasants receiving their 'cocoa money', 'cotton money' and the like. Africans naturally exerted themselves to earn in a manner which was remunerative and congenial. Colonial administrations, missionaries and private companies employed junior clerks, artisans and (in the case of the first two) schoolteachers. The drive to obtain education was related to these job opportunities, especially since they were closely connected with the growing popularity of urban living.

The backward regime of taskor piece-work was widely pursued, and workers received no benefits for sickness, disability, unemployment and old age.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > Labour > The labour system and legislation"", 'content': ""In French Africa, the administration controlled recruitment which in theory, after 1921 in AEF, could not exceed 'one-third of the able-bodied male population having reached adult age'.

The limit was reduced to 10% in the middle of the decade because of the drying-up of the labour pool; but in general the official quota was very considerably exceeded.$^{20}$ In the Portuguese colonies, a subtle distinction was established between 'penal labour' reserved for convicts, and the labour - 'a moral and social obligation' - of men between 14 and 60 years of age, for at least six months per year.$^{21}$ The state was 'to have no scruples about obliging and if necessary forcing the Negro savages of Africa to work, that is, to improve themselves through labour in order to improve their means of existence, to civilize themselves'. 22 The plague of recruiters was particularly prevalent in the Congo, where the state delegated its powers of recruiting to companies such as the Bourse du Travail du Katanga (BTK) a private agency recruiting for the mines in the rural zones. In 1926, to ease the labour shortage, the government awarded to the Union MiniŁre du Haut Katanga (UMHK) the recruiting monopoly in Maniema (Eastern Province) and in Ruanda-Urundi. 23 Finally, in the Portuguese colonies, scandals broke out periodically, such as the scandal of forced and slave labour on the cocoa plantations of Sào TomØ and Principe at the turn of the twentieth century.

The tendency of West African merchant firms to monopolize through 'pools' is well known, and trading companies throughout the continent guarded their interests by refusing to compete in such a way as to raise prices. Indeed, intermediaries such as the 'Asians' in East Africa and the Lebanese in West Africa also set prices and conditions among themselves so that the African peasant had little choice when he went to make his sales. The cash-crop farmer faced the prospect of being gypped at the weighing scales, in the processing stage (as with the cotton ginnery), in transportation, in the calculation of returns and in the repayment of loans or advances where applicable. African producers were also making retail purchases from the middlemen traders and the commercial firms. A fundamental inequality marked the exchange between the colonial economy and the metropolises. This unequal exchange was reflected in the disparity between the low remuneration Africans received and the relatively high cost of manu› factured imports; and it also manifested itself in the low wage rate in the colonies as compared with the metropolises. Of course, unequal exchange was not a purely economic phenomenon. It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

Nowhere did the 'European sector' develop so rapidly, dwarfing the 'traditional' African economy. This economic pattern and the complexity of ethnic stratification are attributable to the ways in which colonization proceeded, which in turn was determined by the natural conditions and the vast natural wealth of that part of Africa.\nBy 1919 the historical tenor of economic life in most of Southern Africa had been upset to a greater degree than in other parts of the continent. Millions of people had been drawn into the sphere of capitalist exploitation. By the middle of the 1920s more than 200000 migrant workers, recruited from as far away as Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, were employed in the South African mines.$^{2}$ Upwards of 60000 labourers worked in the copper, tin, diamond and gold mines of the Congo. 3\nBecause of the development of European farming and large-scale expropriation of land from the peasants in a number of Southern African countries, African participation in the production of export crops and in trade was thwarted except in sectors of forced production such as cotton in the Congo.$^{4}$ Similarly, the road was barred to the emergence of a large stratum of African capitalist farmers and merchants, which is a feature of many other colonies where there were much fewer white settlers. Loss of land, strangulation of the peasantry, proletarianization and urbanization were thus processes that went faster and deeper in most Southern African countries than in other parts of Africa. 5\nA permanent and numerically significant proletarian body of African and non-European descent was, it has been seen in Chapter 16, forming more rapidly in a number of Southern African countries. Its more advanced contingents were represented by workers in the industrial cities and ports. Most of the African labour in mining and in the cities was initially recruited from seasonal workers. Yet an increasing number of people came to depend on the seasonal occupation for their livelihood, and, over time, a process of labour stabilization occurred. As a result, the emergence of an African urban proletariat was more advanced there than in most parts of West and East Africa. There were even more seasonal workers in white-owned farms, with land expropriation rapidly swelling the ranks of the rural proletariat."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

The distinction between peasants and sailors, or 'bushmen' and 'fishmen' was of long standing; but the volume of the slave trade in the eighteenth century in this hitherto relatively spared area stengthened the position of the 'bushmen'. However, the famous group of 'five Kru towns' which seem to have come fairly recently (about the sixteenth century) from the interior, played a special role in the slave trade. Among them, the two communities - peasants and sailors - were closely integrated. This district round the Setta-Kru, which formed the heart of Krawi country, forged special links with Sierra Leone, which brought a new impetus for culture change. It seems that, from the 1780s onwards, many boats used to take on 'fishmen' as interpreters or deckhands before going on into the Gulf of Guinea. This movement, interrupted by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, started again strongly after 1815, when the clandestine slave trade co-existed with the incipient legitimate trade. The Kru soon established themselves in large numbers in Freetown and then in Monrovia as labourers and woodcutters. They remained cohesive, but adopted aspects of Creole culture as well. The coastal lineages ('fishmen' or 'Krumen') used their connections with the interior to mobilize labour. Throughout the nineteenth century, ships rarely sailed east along the coast without taking on 'Krumen', and this activity gradually spread as far as the Sassandra. It changed somewhat in nature but not in extent after 1850, when steam largely replaced sail.\nEuropean activity became integrated with the ancient community of coastal fishermen which stretched from the Krawi east to the Gold Coast; it was symbolized by the worship of the famous 'Big Devil' of Hedie, near the mouth of the Cavally, which drew people from as far as the Alladian country on the Ivory Coast. Sailing ships usually dropped south away from the coast on their westward, return voyages to avoid contrary winds and current, but this caused no problem for the Krumen, who landed far to the east with their pay.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

That no Krooman or Kroomen hereafter shall or can be shipped from this port without his or their advanced money being paid in gold or silver coin by his or their master or masters, agent or agents, or the pursers of the mail steamers calling at Cape Palmas, and parts adjacent, for Kroomen.  \nThis is practicable, and may easily be effected thus: A Krooman sent to the Kroo country to get a new set of Kroomen to relieve the old ones, may bring with him the money with which the said advance may be paid, or may bring an order on the purser to pay the desired sum of money.\n\n2. No person or persons addicted to the maltreatment of Kroomen shall hereafter obtain a Krooman for his service from this port.\n\n3. No person or persons intentionally detaining Kroomen one or two months longer after their term of twelve (12) months is expired, shall be entitled to obtain a Krooman from this port.\n\n4. If one or two, or more, Kroomen are proved guilty of theft, the culprit or culprits alone must suffer the punishment of forfeiting a portion of his or their wages, according to the value or quality of the articles he or they may steal.\n\n5. A sick Krooman or Kroomen shall be sent home on the first opportunity, or after the expiration of a month, according to the nature of his or their disease.\n\n6. The master or masters of Kroomen must always strictly request the pursers or captains of the mail steamers carrying Kroomen home, to instruct their ship's crew not to evil-treat the persons of the passenger Kroomen, nor embezzle their goods, which is usually done when the passenger Kroomen are in the act of landing their goods.\n\n7. The Kroomen shall be allowed at least two or more hours to land their effects, according to the state of the sea, whether rough or smooth.\n\nThe above will take effect on the 1st day of March next.  \nGiven under my hand and public seal, in conjunction with my Chiefs, this 29th day of January (at Cape Palmas), in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four (1874); of my reign the first.""}, {'id': 2887, 'article_title': 'Ill-treatment of Krooboys on the West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Ill-treatment of Krooboys on the West Coast', 'last_edit_date': '05-17-1875', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1875#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_07_1875', 'content': ""Sir,—The steamship Roquelle arrived at this port on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 11th inst., and, as usual, several Krooboys went on board to ship for the Leeward.

We then expressed our readiness to insert any explanations that might be addressed to us on the subject. We have not hitherto received any. The two Steamship Companies, who have rendered immense service to the West African merchants and traders, and consequently to the cultivators in Africa, by the greatly increased demand for their produce, consequent on the growing facilities which those Companies have afforded for shipping it to European ports, more especially Liverpool, do now virtually enjoy a monopoly of the carrying and passenger trade between England and West Africa. Some efforts have from time to time been made to break down that monopoly, which, however, proved to be far too strong for the new adventurers. Nor do we for ourselves deprecate in any way the continuance of that monopoly, the right to which we think these Companies have fairly earned, provided always that it does not grossly abuse its power. And this we are now compelled to say it does in the matter of accommodation—or rather, of what is represented to us as the total lack of all decent accommodation or treatment for and of second-class passengers between Liverpool and the West Coast ports.

Over large areas drink is almost the sole currency, and in many parts the year\'s wages of the negro factory worker are paid altogether in spirits.\n\nWe read with shame and alarm the wanton acts of misgovernment, which are of periodical, if not constant, occurrence on the West Coast of Africa, from the Gambia down to the mouth of the Niger and the Oil Rivers District. The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

As, however, the chief depots, from which Kroo boys are obtained, are under the jurisdiction of the Liberian Republic and the Government of the French Ivory Coast, those authorities have considered themselves justified in charging a poll tax on the recruitment of Kroo labour. The Liverpool Chamber of Commerce has long felt that the tax was a great hindrance to the engagement of labour, and, therefore, to the fuller development of the British Colonies, and for a long time have used every effort to induce the Government to obtain its abolition. Other methods, also, of surmounting the difficulty have been carefully considered, one of which—viz., the scheme for establishing ""settlements or colonies"" of Kroo boys in the British colonies themselves—will, if successful, eventually be of great benefit. This scheme has several times been brought before the notice of the Colonial Office, and received favourable attention. Lately negotiations have been going on between H.M. Consul for Liberia and the authorities of that Republic, with a view to a satisfactory settlement of the question. The Liverpool Committee accordingly sent the following letter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs—viz.: ""August 22, 1896. My Lord,—At a special meeting of the Committee of the African Trade Section held recently, the question of the tax levied on the embarkation of Kroomen at ports under the jurisdiction of the Government of Liberia again came forward for consideration.

It is believed that if the Liberian Government consent to abolish this tax, on condition that the steamship companies call at recognised ports of entry only, the companies concerned would be willing to comply with such condition. I am, however, to point out to your lordship that, under those circumstances the necessity for adding Settra Kroo and Half Cavally to the number of such ports will become more urgent than ever.

A part of the Government House has fallen down, and some property belonging to the agricultural society, in cotton, is destroyed. My loss is considerable, but precaution was taken to remove the cotton machinery and my moveable properties to this place. At Aquamu, and beyond Kpong, the lives of eight human beings were lost by the upsetting of canoes.\n\nThe state of affairs with us here is truly deplorable. These eastern districts are in a more disorganised condition than the western. There has been a series of misfortunes and troubles for some years past, but in this year they have been more apparent. The early part of it was inaugurated with a civil fight in Aquapem. Chiefs and people were killed. Government satisfied itself by fining them 400l., but no effective measures were taken to put a stop to the recurrence of such excesses. Every combustible for another civil fight is in preparation, and there is only wanting a little fire to kindle the whole into a flame. Look at Kroboe now. And on the river Volta _the slave-trade is revived and carried on with such vigour_ as has not been witnessed for some time past. Kpong is the depot for it. The authority of the place is usurped by the Addahs and Anwoolas, a set of savage robbers of human beings, kidnapping, panyarring, and oppressing to an incredible extent, _and that within the limits of British jurisdiction_. The other day, in broad daylight, at Kpong, seven poor people, who came from Aquapem to buy salt, were seized by the Anwoolas residing there and carried off in a canoe, probably to be shipped in a slave ship. Now and then we see slaves gagged, or put in log, passing by Kpong to the slave coast. Here and there, at Aquamu or Assuchary, a human being is commanded to shoot himself, or is massacred as a charge of witchcraft. A\n\nMissionary from Odumase, the other day, was the means, at his own expense, of rescuing one from the jaws of a most cruel death at the latter place.\n\nIn April last Kroboe was invaded by the Addahs and Aquamus, on account of the murders committed by them (people stolen and sacrificed to their Fetish). The latter were satisfied with about 300 heads of cowries (150 dollars), and the murderer given up to them, whom they sold to the Anwoolas, and he has since gone to the slave ship. A chief, by name Jaga, and his son, were given up to the former, with about 800 heads of cowries (400 dollars).

They even go so far as to say that if we are killed, the Queen of England will take no notice about us, and does not know if any British subjects are killed. Yet they do not venture such treatment upon us, because the King is just, and is trying to execute justice and maintain truth.\n\nThere is a court here which they call a Court of Equity, in which the British Consul sits at times when there is occasion for his services, but will not allow the British subjects who are on the beach to attend the court at the time of meeting, fearing we may know of all the orders from the British Governor to the Consul.

Kroomen only engage to serve for from twelve to eighteen months; then they want to go back to their own country, and you have to get a fresh gang; so that, just as you get your Kroomen properly trained into your way of working, and they become really valuable, they go away, and are succeeded by a gang of strangers, many of whom are quite untrained in labour in Coast work.

Here there is a certain amount of good trade, and there might be much more, but unfortunately, though amongst the citizens of the Republic, notably in Mr. Blyden, we find some men whose intellect and culture would fit them for any society in the world, the greater portion of the settlers from America and their descendants have not fulfilled the high hopes of those who took part in the foundation of this negro State, where, untrammelled by any fancied superiority of the whites, and saved from the contamination of vice, the negro was to prove his capability for progress and self-government.\n\nAt the same time, Liberia is far from deserving all the abuse that is lavished on it, for nowhere else on the coast of Africa do we find such evidences of civilization among negroes as here, and the faults they possess are those which are common to all civilized negroes. Their self-government has been sneered at, but it is wonderful that people without any experience should have done as well as they have. Commercial morality is not at a high standard, and more might be done in cultivation and improvement of the fertile country which is under the Liberian flag; and the Liberians would be wise if they did not insist upon negro blood being present in the veins of all their citizens. But many of the faults we see are faults of ignorance, and others arise from the bad example of whites. The coffee plantations of Liberia might be increased almost to an infinite extent, and through Liberia there should be opened up a route to the interior which would bring a large trade to the coast. Between Liberia and the French possession at Grand Bassam, on the frontier of the Gold Coast Colony, lies a long strip of coast inhabited principally by Kroomen, who trade with Bristol ships, but who will tell nothing of the interior; and hitherto the trade has been carried on by sailing ships from Bristol, which cruise up and down the coast. Till quite lately, only one or two white men have lived on shore, the places where the captains and supercargoes of the British ships landed being few and far between; but now the German flag has been hoisted over some small trading stations, and probably soon we shall find that these form pretexts for annexation to the German empire. Now that the Krooboys are so largely employed in the Oil Rivers, in the Gold Coast Colony, on board the mail steamers and in men-of-war, there should not be any difficulty in sending explorers to examine the terra incognita behind their homes, and from such examination we should reap immediate commercial advantage.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Complaints from Old Calabar', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""which we have no desire to violate, and never will intentionally violate,—laws, any infringement of which on our part would involve us in pecuniary sacrifices which we cannot afford to make, and which, we fear, the people of the West Coast would never reimburse us for if we did make them. With this preface, we call attention to those letters above referred to, and to other statements of similar character from other places that may appear now and from time to time in our columns. Both these Old Calabar complaints, which are not made to us now for the first time, are very serious ones—one of them in a moral and religious, and the other in a social point of view. We know that there is no portion of the self-imposed duties of our Missionary Societies to which they attach more importance, than the selection of fit and proper persons to carry on the great and inexpressibly important work of Evangelization among the heathen. When, therefore, complaints reach us of misconduct on the part of any of these messengers of the Gospel of truth and light, and purity and peace, we are by no means ready or willing to receive or credit them. We are but too willing to believe that there may be personal spite or exaggeration, or, at the worst, possibly some momentary lapse, which—however much to be regretted and deplored, because of the evil repute it may bring upon the holy work with which they are connected, and the hindrance it may place in the way of reception of those good tidings they are commissioned to proclaim—all human instruments are, unhappily, liable to. It is only when, as in this case of Old Calabar, we find reiterated statements of persistence in evil that, as now, we reluctantly decide to give them partial publicity. We had rather confine ourselves to the transmission of the statements to head-quarters—a course which we have in this present case pursued simultaneously with this publication—giving the transmitted statement full and complete, as we have received it, that those whose duty it is may institute without delay the necessary inquiries; if they find the statements to be well founded, may apply the proper remedy, and if they find the charges unjust, may vindicate in our columns (which are always open for such a purpose) the character and conduct that have been impugned. The other complaints, which refer to the conduct of agents, supercargoes, and European clerks of the great British firms trading with the River in question, and who have hulks stationed there for the carrying on of their trade—and which we have said are important in a social point of view—are more difficult to deal with in every way. We know by long experience that it is utterly useless to forward such complaints, with the charges they directly or indirectly contain, to the merchant employers of those agents, supercargoes, and clerks. These persons are sent out to the West Coast by their employers to make money—so to perform the duties with which they are charged, that they may be profitable to their employers. Whether they are or not, is a question with which we have not any concern. The charges to which we give publicity are to the effect, that they use undue, oppressive, and what we should characterize as almost criminal means, for preserving to themselves and their principals a monopoly of the trade. It has long been widely known that they are not over-scrupulous, on the score of justice and humanity, in the means which they employ with this object, and in frustrating as far as possible every effort of Sierra Leone traders to purchase oil and ship it to England. But our Sierra Leone friends should bear in mind that these people have organized the trade there, at great expense and risk, at a time when there were not any West Coast native traders in a position to make even the slightest effort to do this; and that they cannot be expected to relinquish what they have thus organized, so long as it can be carried on profitably by them, without a struggle. That struggle, however, must be restrained within such limits, that it shall not infringe the rights of other British subjects to carry on their trade without let or hindrance. The great merchants represented by these European agents, supercargoes, and clerks, could not carry on their business there, without leaning on the protection and influence of Her Majesty's Government; which has always been ready to insist with the native kings and chiefs on the redress of any wrong done to them and their trade; and it will certainly be one of our objects to make that protection and influence efficacious for West African native traders, as it is for them—and even to procure that the same power and influence shall be used against them, for this purpose, if necessary, through their overstepping those limits within which trade struggles everywhere should be restrained. The advantage they have over all others by their stocks of goods ready for barter, their power of giving credit, and their hulks ready to receive oil to be trans-shipped for England by steamer or otherwise, ought in themselves to be sufficient to secure for them all that they can be in any way entitled to, without their resorting to unjustifiable and oppressive measures against their weak opponents, who may be striving to obtain a livelihood. Our complainants, however, go further than the mere complaint about wrongs done to them. They carry the war into the enemy's quarters by insinuating that they are dishonest in their dealings with their employers in England—unworthy of the confidence of their employers; and that the latter would obtain much better results in their operations if they would engage these West Coast educated natives, principally from Sierra Leone, as their clerks and agents. We have nothing to do with the first portion of this insinuation; the question there is entirely between the European agents, supercargoes, and clerks, and their employers; who, no doubt, believe they have good grounds for regarding them as faithful and dependable. But with respect to the latter insinuation or recommendation, that Sierra Leoneans should be employed instead; and that their employment would give the merchants much better results, we are sorry, indeed, to feel compelled to say that we are not able at present to endorse it. That such ought to be the case, is incontrovertible, but there must be a great change before we could feel a conviction that such would be the case. With sorrow and shame, we feel constrained to admit that, as a general rule, they have not established a reputation such as would encourage a feeling of confidence and trust in them. There are men among them who shed a lustre on their race for commercial probity, and the possession of those qualities which elevate a trading community; but these are the exceptions, not the rule. Had it not been so, there would at this time be few, if any, Europeans employed on the West Coast. The Sierra Leoneans have so great an advantage over them for service there, that all that is wanting among European merchants is confidence in them, to lead to their almost exclusive employment. Greatly, indeed, do we desire that they may speedily inspire that confidence; but until they do we cannot hope to see them in the chief positions of trust on the West Coast. We may, in a future article, enter into the question of what has led to the feelings of distrust in them which now so much prevail; and the degree in which these feelings are just or unjust. Justified though they may be in many respects by facts, we do not hesitate to state that they are not entirely so; and that the subordinate West African, has been but too often made the scape-goat for European delinquents."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-09-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East and Central Africa Foreign Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sometimes the wind causes the mouths of the wells to be filled with sand.

The General History of Africa highlights that mineral resources, including coal, were exploited primarily with foreign capital, often excluding Africans from benefiting from these resources. It notes that coal mining was particularly significant in Nigeria and Southern Rhodesia, underscoring its importance as a power source, while colonial administrations systematically excluded Africans from the mining industry, granting monopolies to imperialist interests. This reflects the strategic economic interests of European powers in controlling these resources, with mining industries booming and contributing significantly to the export sector during the colonial period. The African Times articles further emphasize the strategic importance of coal, highlighting discoveries in Natal and proposals for railway construction to facilitate coal mining, crucial for the British steam navy and imperial interests. They also mention the Portuguese East Africa Company's plans to access mineral-rich areas, including coal deposits, through railway construction and concessions for coal exploration. The articles underscore the economic potential of Africa's natural resources, such as gold, palm oil, and rubber, while also reflecting a broader colonial agenda that intertwined economic exploitation with the spread of Christianity and civilization. Together, these sources illustrate how natural resource exploitation was a key component of European colonial strategies in Africa, with coal being an important, though not singular, focus within a broader strategy involving various mineral resources.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide several details that support the claim that the discovery and exploitation of coal and other natural resources in Africa were central to the economic strategies and colonial interests of European powers.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Gold was mined in the Gold Coast, Southern Rhodesia, Tanganyika and Sierra Leone. Diamonds became an important industry in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast. Copper mining was restricted to Northern Rhodesia, while iron-ore mining remained a speciality of Sierra Leone. Only Nigeria and Southern Rhodesia mined coal, an important source of power. Most terri› tories had one or two minerals, only Southern Rhodesia and Sierra Leone had a variety. Starting with platinum and gold in 1929, by the mid-i930s Sierra Leone was mining, in addition, chrome ore, iron ore and diamonds.\nThe discovery of mineral deposits in the countries under discussion was not a fortuitous affair of the colonial period. Either minerals had been known and worked long before the colonial era, or deposits were found by men who were specifically searching for minerals. Before the colonial era both Southern Rhodesia and the Gold Coast, where the local population had mined and worked gold for generations, were noted for their potential mineral wealth rather than their agricultural prospects. In Nigeria, too, the local population had mined and worked tin for generations before the white men penetrated the interior. Thus in a number of cases prospecting during the colonial period started with locating areas where mining had been carried out by the local population. Expectations of growing rich overnight attracted many Europeans and much capital into Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, but a 'Second Rand' was not found, only small deposits being located.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods.

Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

By the mid 1880s, the Scramble was already taking place on Lake Victoria, on whose shores colonial enterprises were quickly grafted on to the already high level of African economic activity. When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form. North African economies were as much part of a Mediterranean complex as they were part of the African trans-Saharan network. Prior experience with the European economy allowed segments of North African society to accommodate to the intensifi› cation of production for Europe and to the spread of European commodities in local markets. But the well-defined and exploitative ruling class was determined to defend state frontiers, even if willing to enter closer economic relations with Europeans. Therefore, colonial rule often advanced while maintaining North Africans in nominal authority, and the colonial economy was institutionalized before the complete subjugation of the indigenous polities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

The Portuguese made extensive claims both in Angola and in Mozambique. They had established military outposts and prazos (agricultural estates) in the interior, and from time to time they controlled the area from Loje, south of Cuanza, as far east as Kassanje, apart from trading posts on the coast between Ambriz and Moçâmedes. In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials. The increased demand for slaves in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century had shifted attention from the prazo system, and the security of the trade routes depended more on the pombeiros (barefoot mulatto merchants), bearing Brazilian trade-goods and surviving only on the good will of African rulers and merchants.$^{10}$ The French had revived their trading posts in Senegambia after 1815, notably Saint-Louis and GorØe.

They spent the next twenty years overcoming the resistance of the Algerians, notably the movement led by Amir 'Abd al-Kädir. The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture. With the increasing prosperity and expansion of the Creoles to Bathurst (now Banjul), Badagry, Lagos and beyond, British commercial and missionary influence was spreading along the coast and at one or two points like Abeokuta began to penetrate into the interior around 1850. On the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the British still shared the trade with the Danes and the Dutch, and took measures to resist Asante (Ashanti) efforts to dominate the coast, notably by exploiting the Fante fear of Asante domination and encouraging the Fante to act together under British tutelage.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: North Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The economy of North Africa in the first quarter of the twentieth century did not develop at the same pace or pass through the same stages in all constituent countries (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Egypt and Sudan), because they were not colonized at the same time (see Fig. 17. i).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'African participation in the colonial economy, 1920-30', 'content': 'forest reserves existed.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours.

A man unaddicted to drink and gluttony may live, and does live, an enjoyable life in West Africa; he enjoys it so much that, like Emin Pasha, he refuses to be rescued. Officers and others have told me they preferred being out there for a time, not only because they liked the life, but because ""dear old Cox"" has been able to transfer the balance of their account from the debit to the credit side.\n\nWest Africa is the coming country; it teems with wealth; it is within easy distance of this country, and can be brought within six days of the London market if necessary. All that we require to do is to get rid of the drink, open out the country as honest people, and make room for our surplus population, from the nobleman\'s son down to the humblest artisan and labourer. There is fibre there for our manufacturers of Lancashire and Yorkshire; there is gold, silver, copper, coal, precious stones, ivory, india-rubber, nitrate, indigo, antimony, guano, palm oil, kola, ebony, mahogany, gum-copal, potash, ginger, gum, iron, farinaceous foods, dye woods, tanning material, spices, coffee, tobacco, cocoa, cotton, and other produce. Some of these vegetable products grow wild. Horses, camels, and sheep, can be bred in the north-east. The list of articles to be found on the coast reads like the inventory of a Liverpool warehouse. The wealth of West Africa is simply boundless, illimitable. It confirms Lord Palmerston\'s prediction of it in 1860, when he said that it ""would be a source of wealth, not to Europe only, but to the world, to such an extent that imagination itself could hardly follow it.""', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Future of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Karl Peters, on March 5, delivered a lecture on ""The Future of Africa,"" before a meeting of the Foreign Press Association, held at the Society of Arts, Adelphi, London. Dr. Peters said that there were to be found in Africa a number of cool and healthy high plateaux, where the white man could not only live in comfort, but where he found all conditions for agricultural and pastoral pursuits just as in his old country. There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry. A modern traveller had truly said that ""the greatest treasure of Africa consists in the inexhaustible labour force of its inhabitants."" The Native population, which was estimated at about 200 millions, only required to be organised by the whites in order to raise the natural wealth of the continent. A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon. Africa required railways and highways in every part for the purpose of its economic development and civilisation. Rinderpest must be exterminated. The whole African question was the question of communication, and in the solution of this question lay the conditio sine qua non of the future of the Dark Continent.

Human interest, resting in Europe upon the strong fulcrum of human wants, is the mighty lever that God has clearly ordained for lifting the great continent of Africa to the position she has been endowed for. She has passed rapidly, though it may seem to have been slowly, through the earlier stages of her elevation. The epoch of more potent effort has now arrived. Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it. Just as powerful European organizations prosecuted the slave-trade in Africa which individual cupidity desultorily commenced, and thus gave to that accursed traffic the enormous development to which it attained, so will powerful European organizations now take the field in giving development to that legitimate commerce for which Africa possesses so many rich and copious elements. A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array. Companies with too restricted capital can only do the same sort of work that individual merchants have been and are performing. This was and is useful enough for Africa, and beneficial to the merchant, as far as it can prudently go. But Africa now wants more than this. She wants powerful companies, that shall prudently but boldly stimulate and assist her to a much higher and more extensive industrial development. The Company of African Merchants is, and is intended to be, such an one. That it will open to England the great national storehouses of African cotton, we have no doubt; while it will be at the same time be helping forward and reaping other portions of its harvests in the long-opened fields of oils, gums, and other such articles of African produce. We long to see it, and we hope that we shall see it and kindred efficient organizations, take hold of certain richly-endowed districts of Africa with a firm and solid grasp—with a determination to squeeze from them their abundant natural stores, enriching them and elevating them morally and socially in the process—with a firm resolve to employ all those wealth-creating means which advancing civilization in Europe has gradually discovered and applied for stimulating industry and diffusing wealth, comfort, peace, and happiness, among mankind.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Rubber, palm kernels, palm oil, and benni seed (an oil-producing substance) constitute the bulk of the exports of Sierra Leone. The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

Among many other places, our steamer, the ""Kinsembo,"" touched at Duke Town, Old Calabar river. Duke Town and Creek Town, close by it, are situated about forty miles up the sea. Here I found that about 500 tons of palm oil were shipped every week, besides palm kernels, rubber, ebony, and other products of Africa. Now, Old Calabar is an exact reproduction of the Upper Congo in scenery and the character of its vegetation. From Bolobo to Stanley Falls, and up the Lunlungu, Ikelemba, Itimbiri, Lubilash, M\'bura, Arnrurimi, and M\'bungu rivers, the islands and mainland are covered with the oil-palm and rubber trees. Forests are draped with the orchilla weed; the gum-copal is so abundant that tons may be found among the boulders of the Cataract region, which have been washed down from the Upper Congo; the natives know where the largest deposits are to be found. This length of navigation, which has similar features to Old Calabar, is just twenty times the length of river that, in the Bight of Benin, contributes 500 tons of palm oil weekly. When developed to the same extent, this would furnish 10,000 tons weekly. We have also to reckon the ivory, no mean article of commerce, that could be collected from an area of 500,000 square miles, without risk; and also the ground-nuts, or their oil, which could be produced from the area of the Cataract region, where this plant is most in cultivation, besides valuable minerals. We have not reckoned the food products which could be exported within two years from the opening of the railway. In a comparatively brief time steamers departing daily from the mouth of the Congo could not convey the produce of the river and its immediate banks, provided always that the railways were adequate to transport the produce from the Pool.

Even now our knowledge of them is very imperfect, their thorough exploration being impeded by climatic and physiographic influences. In a country, of which the greater part of the surface consists of swamps overgrown with mangrove forests, and which is rendered impenetrable by the luxuriance of the vegetation, geological and geographical studies are rendered all but impossible, whilst the absence of mountains prevents the traveller from obtaining a clear idea of the general configuration. The surface of the country presents a series of flat swampy plains, copiously watered by rivers and streams, and intersected by chains of hills gradually increasing in elevation as we recede from the sea-coast towards the interior, the said chains of hills being, very roughly, parallel to the average trend of the coast. Having regard to the large annual rainfall (about 60 in.), to the exceeding softness of the rocks, and the great sinuosities of the river, as well as to the general surface contour, no geologist can doubt that we have here a well marked example of a low plateau, from which hills have been produced simply by subaerial denudation, the harder portions having resisted the influence of the aqueous action which has worn the softer parts into hollows and valleys. In many cases, the hills owe their existence to a quartz reef which they enclose, and which has formed the backbone of the hill; a confirmation of this theory may be found in the fact that the northern slope of the hills is usually far steeper than the southern, the enclosed reef dipping to the south. The country rock is in most cases a non-stratified and but slightly indurated clay rock, resting upon soft blue slates, at times schistose; but in the present imperfect state of our geological knowledge of this region this statement must be regarded as conjectural rather than conclusive. The writer has never himself seen a single fossil that might aid in fixing the geological epoch of this formation, nor has he ever heard of such having been found, and is disposed to regard it as modern, geologically speaking. Round the bases of these low hillocks, and covering some of the more elevated plains, are deposits of non-consolidated gravels which are occasionally auriferous. These have been and are worked by the natives, especially on the banks of the smaller streams, tributaries of the river Ancobra, which intersects and forms the main highway of communication between the various gold mining concessions and the coast. Hitherto, none of these auriferous deposits have been found sufficiently rich to repay the attention which various European explorers have directed towards them, though there is no reason why such should not be discovered, especially towards the interior.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

818,"The British Empire viewed the Gold Coast as a strategically advantageous and economically valuable colony, primarily due to its rich gold resources, and sought to exploit its potential for wealth and prosperity to meet Britain's economic interests and trade demands.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the British Empire viewed the Gold Coast as a strategically advantageous and economically valuable colony, primarily due to its rich gold resources. The General History of Africa highlights that gold gained significant importance in the Gold Coast's export sector from the early 20th century, with gold accounting for over 40% of the total value of domestic exports between 1905 and 1909. This underscores the British recognition and exploitation of the Gold Coast's gold resources for economic gain. However, the textbook also emphasizes that British colonial economic policies extended beyond gold, aiming to integrate African economies into the world capitalist system to serve British interests, including the export of various raw materials and the import of British manufactured goods. It also notes that the development of the Gold Coast's cocoa industry was largely due to local initiative, indicating a broader economic strategy beyond just gold exploitation. Meanwhile, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of the British Empire's view of the Gold Coast's gold deposits as immensely valuable, often comparing them to other renowned gold regions like California and Australia. The articles stress the need for British investment and infrastructure development to fully exploit these resources and enhance trade, while also discussing the strategic importance of the Gold Coast's proximity to England. However, they critique the British government's past neglect and mismanagement, highlighting a gap between the potential recognized by some and the actions taken by authorities. This critique reveals complexities in the British approach, suggesting bureaucratic inertia and missed opportunities despite the recognized potential.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""All these guiding principles were made clear, explicitly or implicitly, to the colonial administrators. But there was an equally important assumption which seems to have been confused by some colonial administrators and other apologists of colonialism and this is the fact that the British, like other colonizers, went out to the colonies primarily, if not exclusively, to enrich themselves and promote their own interests. The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas. Such a state of affairs was in no way a peculiarity of a few colonies. It was the normal reality of colonial economic relations.

The appropriation of the surplus by international capital is revealed by the backwardness and general poverty of the dependencies during the mid-i930S.

The slaving zones from Senegal to Sierra Leone, from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Nigeria and from the Congo river to Angola were the stretches of coast› line first encroached upon by the European colonizers. In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves.

Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day.

In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

But the limited nature of African participation should guide our assessment. Mining was established with foreign capital, and profits accruing from the industry were repatriated to swell the pockets of shareholders abroad, or to develop economies outside Africa. For instance, when the Charter of the Niger Company was revoked in 1899, the company was compensated £150000 for its mining rights in the region where tin mining was later established. According to the same agreement, the company was to receive as much as 50% of all royalties from mining for ninety-nine years.$^{59}$ This was a very heavy price for the local population to pay, but the situation was even worse in the Rhodesias, where mining rights remained in the hands of the British South Africa Company until 1933 when they were purchased by the state for £2 000 000.$^{60}$ But even after this change the local population was rarely regarded, and even more rarely treated, as the beneficiaries of mining operations. As late as 1942, a high-ranking official in the British Colonial Office shamelessly placed on record that 'there is particularly little reason for reserving the value of the mineral product to the local inhabitants when those inhabitants have done nothing to develop it'.$^{61}$ But even where the colonial administrations nationalized minerals, as was the case in Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, little revenue, mainly from royalties and income tax, was realized. In Sierra Leone direct revenue from minerals in 1935 was £34100, which was only 5% of total revenue. 62 Wages remained the only way by which the local population could have acquired a substantial portion of the proceeds from mining, but, as was the case in settler and plantation agriculture, they were kept so low that wage earners had to be subsidized by the peasant sector.

As a matter of fact, in some cases advances were made despite discouraging official policies and practices. Even the Gold Coast cocoa industry, of which the British were greatly proud, was essentially developed with local initiative. Allan McPhee, one of the en› thusiastic admirers of imperialist expansion into Africa, erroneously gave credit to the colonial administration for the success of the cocoa industry in the Gold Coast. To him 'there seems little doubt that the cocoa industry of the Gold Coast is a foster child of the Government'.$^{26}$ But recent scholarship$^{27}$ has drawn attention to the limited nature of the government contribution to the formative stages of this industry. Indeed, on a number of occasions, agricultural experts, who were paid substantial salaries from the taxes of the agricultural producers, proved more ignorant than the producers, and their advice proved disastrous.$^{28}$ Despite the misguided activities of the Agricultural Department, the industry expanded.

British attitudes and policies towards land varied from region to region, and even, in each region, from colony to colony. It can be stated in general terms, however, that whereas Africans remained in practice in control of their lands in British West Africa, many of them were deprived of theirs in British East and Central Africa. There were, however, some important variations from colony to colony in each region.\nIn Uganda and to a lesser extent Tanganyika, most of the fertile land was owned by the indigenous population, the Africans. With a few ex› ceptions, for example Buganda in Uganda, the Bukoba and Kilimanjaro areas in Tanganyika and Gikuyuland in Kenya, land did not acquire market value on a large scale, and it was held communally. Every member of the community had the right to land. In most cases it was labour, and not land, which was the scarcer means of production.\nForeigners, mostly British, secured and held concessions on land with mineral and timber resources, but such arrangements had little adverse effect on the local agricultural communities.

With almost no exception, mineral wealth belonged to the British Crown or its agents and was disposed of in ways decided by the official and unofficial agents of imperialism.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Currency and banking', 'content': ""Like the other colonial powers, the British also introduced modern curren› cies into their colonies in place of the traditional system of barter, com› modity currency, and currencies such as gold dust and cowries.

Indeed, the colonial powers went out of their way to promote and encourage the adoption of modern money in three main ways. These, according to Hopkins, were 'by demonetising traditional currencies; by paying [the] expanding labour force in European coin; and by insisting on receiving taxes in cash rather than in kind'. 67 These methods proved very successful and by 1910 European currencies were widespread in West Africa. In the British colonies these consisted of a wide variety of English coins. In 1912, the West African Currency Board was established to supply currencies to British West Africa. In 1913, the Board issued its first coins of the denominations of 2s, is, 6d and 3d and three years later its first currency notes. In British East Africa, the British at first introduced the currency system operating in British India. In 1920, however, one currency board was established to issue coins and notes for the three colonies. It should be noted that all these currencies were linked with sterling in London.\nOne important consequence of the increasing use of currencies was the introduction of banking institutions in British Africa.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British expansion in South Africa 1870-80', 'content': 'Indeed, Norman Etherington$^{31}$ goes a long way to substantiating the views of Atmore and Marks when he shows that after the discovery of diamonds, African labour was drawn from all over the subcontinent, including what are today Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and that the Trans› vaal, Orange Free State and the Zulu kingdom obstructed its free flow. Moreover, Shepstone, the key source of information in the 1870s for British policy-makers and operators, was not only concerned about immediate solutions to the problem of securing African labour for the British capital› ists, but looked further to see the solution to the whole problem as lying in a federation of the white states with a common African policy. Clearly, therefore, some accounts of British imperialism in South Africa have neglected the growing economic importance of the region to Britain, a situation which became increasingly apparent at the end of the 1860s with the discovery of diamonds and reports of gold deposits, and most evident in the i88os when gold began to be mined in the Witwatersrand.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'South Africa, 1880-1935', 'content': ""Secondly, the discovery led to the pouring in of capital and technical personnel from Britain, Europe and the United States. Indeed, the bulk of the investments in colonial Africa between 1880 and 1939 went to Southern Africa alone. According to P. Curtin and others, on the eve of the Second World War, 'outside per capita investment was estimated at £$6 in South Africa, £38 in the two Rhodesias ... and £13 in$^{ tne}$ Belgian Congo, but not more than £10 anywhere else in tropical Africa'.$^{96}$ It was this investment that promoted not only the mining industry but, as we shall see presently, the infrastructure of South Africa. That South Africa should have led here is not surprising for, as Houghton has pointed out, Griqualand from being 'a forgotten no-man's-land inhabited by a few hundred Griqua under their chief Waterboer', thanks to the discovery of diamonds, 'suddenly became a focus of world interest'.$^{97}$ The discovery of gold did the same thing for the Transvaal and the areas south of the Limpopo river.\nEqually revolutionary was the impact of the mining industry on the provision of infrastructure in South Africa. The huge distances between settlements and towns - Johannesburg is 1540 km from Cape Town and the sparseness of the population had hitherto ruled out the construction of railways as a viable proposition. But the discovery of gold and diamonds made railways and roads not only necessary but also practical. It is not surprising then that railway construction began in the 1870s from different points - Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban - all leading first to the diamond fields and then after 1886 into the Transvaal.

The colonizers had to supplant the Arab, Swahili and Indian merchants. Experiences in East Africa underscored the premise that colonial activities first centred around parts of Africa which had a prior involvement in inter› continental exchange. The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region. By the mid 1880s, the Scramble was already taking place on Lake Victoria, on whose shores colonial enterprises were quickly grafted on to the already high level of African economic activity. When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form. North African economies were as much part of a Mediterranean complex as they were part of the African trans-Saharan network. Prior experience with the European economy allowed segments of North African society to accommodate to the intensifi› cation of production for Europe and to the spread of European commodities in local markets.

Nor will they be at all beyond the means of the Government to effect. Whatever change they bring upon the revenue, will be soon met by a much more than corresponding increase of that revenue. Recent experience in all parts of the world has so fully established the sound economy of reproductive public works, that all argument on this point would be superfluous. The chief question is, how may these works be made most quickly reproductive; or, in other words, what is the order in which it would be most advantageous to execute them? If money, which means also all adequate supplies of materials, can be had in sufficient amount, if adequate intelligent supervision and adequate labour can be obtained for all these works to proceed at one and the same time, it would unquestionably be most rapidly beneficial to both development and revenue that they should be simultaneously commenced and prosecuted. If, however, this cannot be—though we are not at all convinced in our own mind that it cannot be—if only two of them could be managed to begin with, we should be inclined to suggest that these two be the road from the palm oil districts to Accra, and the port of Elmina. The Accra road might be made more or less productive, without the chain of communication between that place and Elmina; because, notwithstanding the difficulties with which the landing and embarkation of goods and produce is attended, means would, no doubt, be found for shipping a much larger quantity of produce than is at present put on board there. It will be seen that our belief is, that whenever the port of Elmina shall be made a good and safe landing and shipping place for produce and goods, it will be much more advantageous and economical to transport all produce and goods to and from Elmina and Accra, than to land and ship them through the dangerous and deteriorating surf which breaks so heavily at Accra. We are impatient to hear that the proper surveys and estimates are being made for the improvement of the port of Elmina, and that the important works there are to be undertaken without delay; because, when this is done, it will become at once evident to the meanest capacities that it will be necessary and profitable to construct also without delay the feeding lines of road. Great Britain is, we repeat, now on her trial before the nations as regards the Gold Coast Colony. Indisputably at the head of European industrial progress, indefatigable in efforts to assist in stimulating progress by the aid of science and capital in other European States, it would be an indelible disgrace to her to allow those Gold Coast countries which she has now taken under her absolute control to languish and stagnate for want of those accessories which she can so easily supply. To supply them would not entail on her one single penny of loss. It would be mere temporary aid from a rich parent to a poor child, who is naturally so endowed with the elements of wealth that the temporary aid cannot fail of the happiest results. The Earl of Carnarvon and Governor Strahan have given us so much evidence of being under the influence of a true spirit of progress, moving in the right direction, that we write, not, as in the olden time, in doubt and despondency, but with earnest and confident hope that they will continue to press onward toward the desired goal of Gold Coast prosperity, which can only be reached by incessant exertion, by well-directed effort in the way of industrial progress and development, accompanied by the introduction of those influences of Christian civilization which can alone be depended upon to elevate the moral status of a people held during so many ages in the cruel and degrading bondage of Satanic superstition.'}, {'id': 3487, 'article_title': 'West African Gold Fields', 'full_section_title': 'West African Gold Fields', 'last_edit_date': '12-07-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1878#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_01_1878', 'content': 'Sir,—Your unceasing efforts for the welfare of Africa and her people have so often been crowned with favourable results, that we hope, also, in the present instance, the Colonial Office may be stirred up and come to an understanding of the importance of changing the present attitude towards the Gold Coast Colony, more especially as regards the working of its rich gold-fields.\n\nThe climate of the Gold Coast has a weakening effect on the muscles (and sometimes on the brains). This may be the reason that, with very rare exceptions, the Government officials on that coast are inimical to any efforts of enterprising private persons to develop the resources of that province; yea, even often go so far as to do their utmost to prevent and impede private enterprise, and with a puerile fear unworthy the English nation, hasten to inform, officially, the kings and chiefs that such and such attempt was undertaken by a private individual, and that the Government had not the least interest in it.

It was, as we felt from the first convinced that it was, only a ""scare."" The alarming tales of armies of invading Ashantees never for one moment deceived us. We knew by experience what ready manufacturers the Fantees are of such tales, though on the late occasion they certainly surpassed all their former exploits in this fertile field of invention. From Axim we heard the wonderful intelligence that the King of Ashanti could bring 90,000 warriors into the field; 28,000 men were reported as already massed on the Prah; 8,000 or 10,000 had already crossed that river, and were within three days\' march of Cape Coast! And these were all, like Falstaff\'s ""men in buckram,"" a myth—a pure creation of terrified or interested Fantee imagination! But what a glorious time for the weak-kneed officials of Cape Coast and Accra; what hurrying to and fro; what concoction of sensational despatches and official and semi-official communications; what special chartering of mail steamers; what splendid military organizations! What a glorious thing it was to know that there was a surplus of 70,000l. to the credit of Gold Coast Revenue, which might now be lavishly expended in meeting a grand imaginary danger, which would have faded away like the ""baseless fabric of a dream""—which it was—at the touch of a few grains of cool common sense. But when has common sense ever had anything to do with Gold Coast government? Let any unprejudiced and dispassionate person read the account we now publish under the head of ""The African Kings Transported by the late Governor Ussher,"" and they will be able to form some idea of the wisdom, justice, equity, and high policy that have characterised British rule on the Gold Coast. The individual mentioned as having received the two hundred ounces of the King of Ashanti\'s gold is well known to us, and we have no reason to doubt the entire correctness of our informant\'s statement, which we earnestly recommend to the consideration of Sir Samuel Rowe and of Earl Kimberley. The article to which our correspondent takes exception, and which induced him to make us this communication, was not intelligence sent expressly to us, but information given to the purser of the steamer Ambriz, and by him to the Press on the arrival of the steamer at Liverpool—information furnished, we have very little doubt, by the identical Mr. —— referred to. Is it not deplorable to see a British Crown Colony thus misgoverned? To whatever cause the disgracefully hasty withdrawal of our conquering troops from Coomassie after the capture and burning of that royal residence, might be owing, a ""policy"" having a definite end in view should at least have been inaugurated and steadily and uniformly pursued. That ""policy,"" if common sense were to have anything to do in the government of the Gold Coast—a country which will ere long take rank as one of the richest, if not the richest, subject to the British Crown—must and would have been to prevent any such reconstitution of the Ashantee Power as could place it in a position even to make a ""scare,"" much less undertake an invasion in the Fantee countries. That such a policy has not been pursued, is but too painfully evident by the expenditure on a ""scare"" of that surplus revenue so much needed for education, improvement of communications, and other objects of utility, hitherto almost entirely neglected. There will now, we hope, be a fresh departure. The gold mining industries now establishing themselves in those rich territories of the Gold Coast Government are too important in themselves, and too necessary to Great Britain as an annual debtor to the United States of America of some 20,000,000l. sterling to be paid in gold, to allow of this question of the permanent relation of the Gold Coast territories with the interior to be any longer trifled with, or left at the mercy of the crass ignorance of accidental yet permanent Governors, who may be ready to give to any modern representative of the daughter of Herodias ""whatever she may ask of him."" What is first of all necessary, indispensable, is that the British Government should wake to the conviction that in the Gold Coast territories they have one of the most valuable and, under present international circumstances, most vitally important possessions of the British Crown. The sooner they arrive at this conviction the better for the national welfare. Having once arrived at this conviction, they will inaugurate and pursue a ""policy."" The French Government are setting them the example. They have evidently inaugurated, and are pursuing, one in the north and north-west of Africa, the success of which is only problematical, while the success of that which we demand for the Gold Coast Colony is certain and assured. And it must be borne in mind that the expressed objective point of the French effort is the source of the River Niger, at which, if they succeed in establishing themselves, they will be high up on, and will command, the northern slope of those Kong Mountains the southern slope of which ought to be the objective point of British enterprise. The great gold field of West Africa, which we have no hesitation in affirming for the hundredth time to be the richest in the world, is the prize for which the two nations are contending.

The British public, instructed by the Gold Mining Companies already at work, and others already organizing, will soon be fully cognizant of this great fact. And when they do thus become cognizant, what will they say to a Government that has hitherto chosen almost to ignore it altogether—even now looks on apathetically, with more distrust than confidence, and has evinced no disposition to aid in overcoming those natural obstacles which necessarily present themselves in a country over which, in consequence of its having been denuded of its once teeming population by the accursed foreign slave-trade, bush and forest have extended until it has become one dense mass of exuberant tropical vegetation, through which not a single road has been opened to afford ready and practicable access to the interior. They may pardon the past, but they will not be so indulgent as regards the future, should this ignorant, apathetic indifference be continued.

J. G. Gillispie, L. V. Berens, Campbell, J. Darlington, E. L. Beckwith, L. Graay, H. Lyons, and C. V. Snooks—were invited on behalf of the African Gold Coast Company and the Abosso Gold Mining Company to witness some experiments at Messrs. J. and E. Hall’s works at Dartford, having for their object the testing of certain improved apparatus for the treatment of auriferous ores, which is on the eve of being sent out to the Company’s mine at Abosso. It ought to be stated that the African Gold Coast Company was the first company organised to work, scientifically, mines which for so many hundred years had supplied gold dust to the world, and which had earned for the country in which they are situated the name of “Gold Coast.” It seems somewhat strange that a French company should thus have been the first to prospect and obtain a footing in a country which gave its synonym to our old well-known coin, the “guinea.” This, however, arose from the fact of the liberation by Sir Garnet Wolseley, on his entrance into Coomassie, of M. Marie Joseph Bonnat, the well-known African explorer, who for five years had been detained a close prisoner by Coffee Calcalii, the King of Ashantee. M. Bonnat had seen the hoarded treasures of the King of Ashantee, and had learnt where many rich deposits of gold, alluvial and otherwise, existed, but it was not until some time after his (M. Bonnat’s) return to France, and the cession by the Dutch of some of their seaports to the British, that matters settled down at the coast, and the Government formed the Gold Coast Colony and protectorates. In 1877 M. Bonnat was sent by his friends (both French and English) to prospect, more particularly, the Ankobra River, in which natives had so often been seen diving for gold, and with considerable success. He succeeded in obtaining from the king and chiefs the privilege of prospecting for and obtaining gold, for a distance of twenty-five miles on both sides of the river, which enters the ocean at Axim. In 1878 the African Gold Coast Company was formed with this privilege, as one of the elements of its future operations, and with other concessions, thus securing a nucleus of most valuable gold mining properties, which it is confidently expected the growing interest of the British public in their African colony will soon develop.'}, {'id': 5884, 'article_title': 'NEW AKANKOO MINING COMPANY.', 'full_section_title': 'NEW AKANKOO MINING COMPANY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-1', 'issue_date': '02_09_1889', 'content': ""\n\nAs to the accounts, they had received £2,000 worth of gold since the beginning of November. Where that came from there was plenty left, so that they were now seeing their way to a good return. Every month they were getting more and more information from the Gold Coast, and more and more was he convinced of the value of about forty square miles of the country lying back from Axim. They knew of six mines at work within the area he had mentioned. Among them was the Akankoo Company, which was doing fairly well, and, he hoped, would do better. He was anxious when he first took charge of the Akankoo Company to secure something like united action on the part of all mining companies. The Akankoo could get their goods from the ship's side direct to the mine, and thus they were able to save a great deal in transport. The manager said that they were taking 20 tons at a time from the ship to Ancobra. One reason why he wished to secure united action was that it was advisable to agree on some uniform rate of wages. He was disappointed that he was not able to announce that they had obtained a Stock Exchange quotation. The Company's papers were before the committee, and they had complied with all the requirements of the Stock Exchange; but the committee had informed them that so many companies had started this year that they must wait their turn. He, therefore, thought it was only a question of a few weeks as to when they would get their quotation. He assured the shareholders that the shares were worth 10s., and if next year he did not see them at £1, he should be disappointed. At one time he was in favour of reducing the shares, but the shareholders did not agree with him, and he must confess he thought they were right, for he did not now see the necessity of it. They were going on as well as they possibly could. London was the base of the Company's operations, and they were a long way from the mine, and would always be at a disadvantage until the telegraph system was improved. The Governor of the Gold Coast had been to see the mine, and the Board were awaiting a report from him. He was now in England. The Board would endeavour to obtain an interview with him, and urge upon him and the Ministry the right of the Gold Coast to some little share of the public money which was saved and remitted home to England. What they wanted was better accommodation for landing at Axim, so as to avoid the dangers attending crossing the bar at particular seasons of the year. He hoped that all Members of Parliament who were interested in mining would give them their support when claims were being made upon the Colonial Government for public works such as he had referred to. He also considered that it would be a great assistance in developing the mines if roads were made in that country. The chairman then read numerous extracts from letters giving details as to the position of the mine. Their present manager, he said, had shown himself most energetic. He was one of those men who did not simply order a thing to be done, but showed the men the way to do it; and was very successful with native labour, which was difficult to manage.

B. Griffith, the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, to Lord Knutsford will show how it comes that that coast has got its name. It has been known for centuries that gold existed in the rivers and the soil of the region immediately behind the coast, and in their own primitive way the natives have probably worked it from time immemorial. Moreover, at various times English companies have been floated for the purpose of mining the precious metal. Machinery has been sent out, and white men have been sent out to superintend it. But either the machinery never got out of the bush, where some of it may still be seen, or the works had to be abandoned from bad management or from the death of the white men who superintend them. Sir W. B. Griffith, in the report just issued, gives a melancholy list of the companies that have been started, got up capital, and come to grief in their efforts to utilise the gold of the Gold Coast. Happily the Governor has a more hopeful story to tell. His report is really the narrative of a journey he made up the Ancobra river in the early part of the present year, and of the various mines he visited which are being successfully carried out under white superintendence. He tells what he saw at the Akankoo, the Gie Appantoo, the Prestea, and other mines, where shafts have been sunk to considerable depths to get at the quartz, where machinery has been erected, stamps fitted up, Europeans are carrying on their work successfully, and hundreds of natives are employed. So far the yield of gold per ton has been moderate, but quite sufficient to give a fair profit on the outlay. The surface has as yet only been scratched, and further careful exploration, especially in the interior, might yield profitable results. Sir W. B. Griffith sums up the position succinctly and clearly. He is convinced that the country is rich in gold, and that it is merely a matter of the necessary time and scientific application for that gold to pay well for extraction. Earnest and well-considered attempts, he states, are now being made to secure success. The country once opened up and cultivated would yield rich returns to capital invested in the economic agriculture of any kind of tropical produce. But unfortunately—and this is the fatally weak point—the natives of the country cannot be relied upon to supply the necessary labour, which must come either from the Kroo country or from China. Chinese it would be a pity to introduce here. The Krooman are well known as the great workers of West Africa, and surely it need not be difficult to obtain a supply of them. At the same time, by patient and intelligent effort, the natives themselves might receive a stimulus to labour when once they saw it would be to their advantage. We believe that in this respect Governor Moloney has met with some success in Lagos. As to the suitability of the region for the residence of white men, we now know so well the conditions under which health can be maintained in the tropics that no man with a sound constitution to start with need come to grief if he give himself fair play.

Even so. And this does not rest upon our testimony alone; it is no discovery of ours. We do but bring forward well-known facts. Year after year, until the years count by centuries, the driblets we write of have been coming into Europe. At one time they furnished its chief supply. History says they amounted some 150 years ago to 3,500,000l. sterling a-year.* Now, in 1863, the total to Europe and America does not probably exceed 700,000l., or 800,000l. The decrease is not the result of exhaustion of metal, but of exhaustion of labourers. The population even 150 years ago was at least five times greater than it is now. Slave wars and the foreign slave-trade caused that exhaustion; as they had already, even at that remote period, reduced the inhabitants one half. At a moderate computation, it seems certain that since the Portuguese first began to import the precious metal from the Gold Coast, above 400 years ago, those lands lying between the sea and the Kong Mountains have furnished from 800 millions to 1,000 millions of pounds sterling of gold to the civilised world. And yet enlightened statesmen of the nineteenth century, because, through gross mismanagement, the Gold Coast costs for government and a shadow of defence some 20,000l. a-year more than has hitherto been raised by imposts, set their faces like flints against every proposition to make and maintain even one good road for vehicles from the Coast to the Ashantee frontier. Why, chiefly? Because they are only Protected Territories. As if Great Britain could ever abandon them; could leave them a prey to Ashantee on the one side, and slavetraders and piratical adventurers, or European rivals, on the other. She cannot leave them; let her, therefore, utilise them; let her benefit herself and them by that which they can yield. We know well that if self-interest will not induce us to make a colony of the Gold Coast, we were idle to appeal to any other feeling. If not, we should say some compunction ought to be felt with regard to territories that have literally lost through us and other European nations 800 millions sterling of treasure, and millions of their population. Lost; for what have they to show? What remains to them for that which they have thus parted with? Why countries thus endowed with wealth, and thus surrendering wealth, ought to have had at least roads, bridges, and cities to boast of. They have not one. But it is not too late. They will have them, and Great Britain must build them. They can pay her largely for them. Every fifty miles of roads and bridges, introducing and securing order, stability, progress, and enlightenment, will open a new mine of wealth. We claim for those territories, as a right, that they should be made a colony of the British Crown. Their future depends on this. They have no inherent power of self-regeneration. They are too deep in the filth of polygamy, slavery, and Devil worship to work out their own release. If they possess any arts, they are of the rudest and most primitive kind. They have neither art nor science of their own to aid them; nothing that will enable them, of themselves, to make a road, a bridge, a harbour, a breakwater, a secure roadstead—any one, in fact, of all those things that are indispensable for development and prosperity, for wealth and civilization. We claim for them, therefore, the right to be made a colony. We shall show in future articles that this may be done, not only without injustice to any, but with manifest and immense advantage to all. And we are convinced that if our public men could be brought so to give their attention to this question of making the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast a British colony as to arrive at a comprehension of the enormous national advantages that are to be obtained by so doing, the anomalous compromising character of our present relations with those territories would be put an end to by the yielding of Her Majesty's Government to an intelligent pressure for the immediate admission of those territories into the list of the colonial possessions of Great Britain."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Gold Coast Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The general fiscal condition of the Gold Coast, as described in a Colonial Office report lately, ""was not only satisfactory but flourishing"" during the last financial year.

The total trade amounted to £1,809,340, of which exports absorbed £877,803. In the last six years the trade has increased upwards of 55 per cent. The chief imports are piece goods, hardware, food-stuffs, and alcohol, while the exports are palm oil and kernels, rubber, gold dust, &c. The Customs revenue is largely derived from spirits, and the Acting-Governor takes occasion to mention that the reputation of trade gin as specially deleterious is undeserved. From an analysis, which he gives, it appears that West African trade gin is not more or less deleterious than the gin sold all over London. The export of palm products amounted to about £225,000, and that of rubber to about £330,000. In the last six years about a million monkeys have been slaughtered on the Gold Coast for the sake of their skins; but this trade is decreasing, because the traders have to go further into the interior to find the monkeys they require. Last year over 90,000 skins, worth over £14,000, were exported.\n\nThe land in the Colony is not generally sufficiently cultivated, though the soil is rich and will produce almost any commodity.

It is believed that the Greeks received gold from these parts 2,900 years ago. Of recent times our first African traveller, Mungo Park, proved the existence of gold north of the Kong Mountain, and described the methods by which gold was won by the Natives; a plan similar to that adopted by the Natives south of the same range. The present gold supply comes from Ashanti, and possibly the bulk of it from Wassau. A little over 40 years ago our principal supply came from the Gold Coast; but when California and Australia came to the front as gold producers, the Gold Coast was to a great extent lost sight of. Since the first supply of gold in 1471, the total amount received from West Africa has been estimated by Captain Burton at £600,000,000, an amount not in the least exaggerated, I should say, when we take into account the regular yearly returns made for a period exceeding 200 years. Other authorities estimate that in the space of 40 years no less an amount than £200,000,000 could have been received. The surface soil in some parts of the country seems to be full of gold; it has been found on the sea beach, in rivers, and even washed from the gutters of the streets of the small towns after rain. Rich mines are found in Gaman and Wassau, the principal gold fields being on the Wassau range. Expeditions have been made from time to time, and quite recently discoveries are reported from the north-west part of the Colony. Such work is slow; the country is covered with dense forest, which makes progress in travelling and surface examinations difficult. As there is traditionally great wealth in the Kong mountains, it would seem wise to construct a line of rails through the country with the object of tapping this region. We are met with the suggestion that it would be a worthless undertaking from the point of trade. This, however, is problematic. There is the conviction that gold obtains abundantly in the interior, which could be confirmed; that there is produce or a country capable of producing it is certain.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-09-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_09_1893#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD FIELDS OF WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M. Bonat, Mr. J. L. Wilson, Sir John Glover, and Dr. Clarke also speak of the abundance of gold. Captain Burton and Commander Burton had very high opinions of this country as a gold producer. Mr. Thomas Cornish visited the Gold Coast as mining expert with Commander Cameron, and spoke well of the prospects. It is commonly thought that the richest deposits have not yet been found, and the districts we are already acquainted with, we do not know in depth. What the depth of the gold-bearing strata is no one seems to have ventured to say. The gravel beds which form the valley of the Tacquah have not been worked to any depth, and as the weight of gold is seven times greater than gravel we should naturally expect to find the richer deposits in depth, in the same way as in the well known hydraulic mines of Western America. The great drawback is the climate, which is generally admitted to be bad, although Europeans have been known to live on the coast for 20 and 30 years. Europeans often in countries like the Gold Coast indulge in excesses which undermine their health, although I cannot for one moment think that all those who have returned with broken health come under this category. Fevers, we know, prevail, and exposure to night dews is courting death. We are interested in\n\nother countries which have the reputation of unhealthiness, such as some parts of South America and India. No doubt by the exercise of the greatest precautions much sickness might be avoided, but we have still the fact that it is dangerous, and that the excessive heat is enervating. This hindrance can only be overcome by the introduction of intelligent and industrious negroes from other parts of the coast. It requires large capital to develop the resources, and it should be known that it is no country for the single-handed prospector.\n\nThere has not been any reliable record kept of the returns of the Gold Coast, nor would it have been very possible to do so, however much desired, the commercial interest having been up to within a few years ago of an indefinite character. At the beginning of the century the gold product was estimated from £300,000 to £3,000,000 annually. Of late years it has been about 25,000 ounces. A revival of interest is now taking place, and the question of a railway may again come forward.

According to the writings of Bosman (1700) the Dutch appeared to be the principal traders and factors on the Coast, and to have built many of the chief forts. From the admissions of the author, they were adepts in the practice of cheating the Natives in their dealings with them for gold. The writer appears to have received instructions to make himself acquainted with the history and resources of the Gold Coast and the country inland as much as possible, and, considering the time and the circumstances under which he was placed, also the difficulty of acquiring information, he has handed down a work containing much valuable information to those interested in the production of gold and other minerals on the West Coast of Africa. He says: ""Guinea is a large country, extending several hundred miles, abounding with innumerable kingdoms and commonwealths. The Gold Coast, being a part of Guinea, is extended about sixty miles, beginning with the Gold River, three miles west of Assini or twelve above Axim, and ending with the village Ponni, seven or eight miles east of Accra. The negro inhabitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold, which they chiefly vend to the English and Zealand interlopers, notwithstanding the severe penalty they incur thereby, for if we catch them their so-bought goods are not only forfeited, but a heavy fine is laid upon them. Not deterred, I say, by this, they all hope to escape, to effect which they bribe our slaves (who are set as watch or spies over them) to let them pass by night, by which means we are hindered from having one hundredth part of the gold of this land; and the plain reason why the Natives run the risk of trading with the interlopers is that their goods are sometimes better than ours and always to be had one-third cheaper, whereby they are encouraged against the danger, very well knowing that a successful correspondence will soon enrich them."" Human nature on the Gold Coast and the desire to get gold—honestly if possible, but to get it—was much the same two centuries ago as now. The English, who were then termed by the Dutch as interlopers, now hold full sway over the country, but have not as yet given much encouragement to the development of the vast gold resources of the country. Accounts from the Congo show that barbarities practised on the Natives and white men by the Belgians are as bad as in the worst days of the slave trade. On my return from the Coast in 1881 I strongly advised the opening of communication with the goldfields from the convenient port of Axim by a system of light rail or tramway (narrow gauge), the trucks for goods and passengers to have been run by Natives, which would have materially assisted the more rapid development of the gold fields. Thus, commencing with a line along the coast from Axim to the mouth of the Ankobra River inside the bar, we should reach the valley of this river, an immense area of auriferous country, with well proved quartz lodes and other formations at various places. The river affords good water way, say, as far as Tomento, and sometimes much beyond. At landing stages like Tomento, leading to Tacquats and other places, the light railways should have been laid to the mining camps, for facilitating easy carriage of goods and passengers. Thus a traveller now requires six Native bearers to carry him about twelve miles a day, whereas on a light railway, as I specially designed, the passengers could be run by Native runners (in relays, say, of ten miles) 50 miles a day easily, and in much more comfort. I pointed this out to the Government authorities before this last Ashanti expedition. People do not go to the West Gold Coast of Africa to grow fruit or cereals, their chief object is gold, and it is to the profitable opening of the goldfields and establishing easy means of communications by light railways we must look to speedily and effectively bring about the increase of the supply of gold from that quarter. A system of river dredging and washing of the sand drifted up in places along the coast could be made highly profitable if properly taken in hand, but the difficulty of efficient management blocks the way. The Government must take measures to inaugurate a better system of travelling inland than by the carriage of men or goods on the heads of native bearers. Light railways, either run by steam or Native power, will be the only means of successfully developing the auriferous resources of the West Gold Coast of Africa.—Yours, &c.,', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL GOLD QUESTION', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In stimulating by all justifiable means in our power the development by European action of the great gold mining resources of West Africa, we are animated by very powerful considerations and motives. For many long years past, as is well known, our regards have been fixed upon the West African gold fields, as containing the fulcrum upon which the lever of West African progress, unless this were to continue at a very slow pace, must necessarily be placed. By their utilized resources we foresaw the introduction of railways, those mighty aids to the spread of civilization which alone could give that ready access to the interior necessary for the intercommunication of scattered tribes and peoples, now kept apart by ignorant and superstitious prejudices, and the lofty pretensions of petty barbarian rulers. It was scarcely possible that we could adequately stimulate that desired working of the gold fields, without ourself taking a personal interest in the work. Private pecuniary considerations have thus become mixed up with our ardent philanthropic and Christian desires and efforts. But although this combination of motives is a powerful one with us, there is another, a mighty one, that is constantly urging us on, and which is quite independent of and apart from that combination. This is a national one. That it is international as well as national where Great Britain is primarily concerned is inevitable. The position to which Great Britain has attained among the nations leads necessarily to this result. By her accumulating wealth, the produce of energy and enterprise in her people, she became the great financial centre of the civilized world. The fact—the unpalatable, but, alas! not less certain fact—that she is now tottering upon that lofty pinnacle, furnishes the national motive to which we have above alluded. And as she totters on the highest pinnacle, so do the minor European financial Powers totter also. The one ruin will involve that of all the others. In our number of January, this year, we pointed out ""that thoughtful minds were becoming troubled with the apprehension that as the greatest of nations have in the past suffered eclipse, so it may be in the future."" ""Europe,"" we continued, ""the actual centre of the world\'s civilizing power, is exhausting its resources and energies in armaments of preposterous magnitude, confiscating, at the bidding of vanity, ambition, covetousness, and fear, those results of human industry which ought daily to increase the sum of human happiness—heaping up mountains of explosives for the work of ruin and destruction, while the rumbling of the passion thunders of defrauded humanity which from time to time break sullenly upon the ears of misguided power, recall the existence of hidden forces, daily and hourly gathering in strength, that may overturn thrones and flood a continent with misery and woe. It seems to us useless and unwise to disguise the fact, although it is most generally ignored, that Europe, through the blindness of its rulers and the increasing wants of its rapidly augmenting populations, is being gradually despoiled of its money sceptre, which must ere long be transferred to that great Western Republic on which Europe and Great Britain in especial are becoming yearly more and more dependent for supplies of food. As Great Britain became the money centre of the world by the contributions which its manufacturing industries and the action of its spirit of enterprise drew from every portion of that world, so the United States of America—Great Britain having lost, and for ever, its manufacturing monopoly,—must and will inevitably become the money centre of the world, by the immense contributions it has been drawing, and will increasingly draw, through its supply of those necessaries of human existence which her vast territory enables her to furnish to the craving multitudes of the Old World. While Europe is committing suicide by her enormous armaments, the United States, having passed successfully through the fiery ordeal of her great Civil War, is husbanding her resources for the increase of production, manufacture, and commerce. The final result of this is certain, and now inevitable. The youthful giant will use its enormous strength without mercy; while the old ones will fall into comparative decrepitude, hastened by their abuse of the power with which they had been entrusted, by the wanton waste of their resources, by their pursuit of the phantoms of ambition, and their lust of extended empire, before which truth, righteousness, and justice were trampled under foot. It is not a pleasant prospect, it may not increase the world\'s happiness, it may produce an enormous crop of human suffering, but it cannot be got rid of by shutting our eyes and refusing to acknowledge its existence."" These opinions remain unchanged; they furnish the key to the national motive that actuates us as regards the great West African gold fields. In the absence of any others that can fairly pretend to compete with them, these hold out the only present prospect of safety for Great Britain. We refer our readers to, and ask their attentive perusal of, the extracts we publish from the Standard and Daily News. They will repay careful and thoughtful reading. The decrease of ""sixteen million pounds a year, or nearly one half of the gold supply a quarter of a century ago, is,"" as the Standard says, ""undoubtedly a very serious affair."" Nor are the following words from the Daily News less worthy of consideration: ""If the American drain be repeated upon anything like the scale of last autumn, we should be threatened with a total loss of the cash reserve of the country, and should have to take strong measures against such loss."" Strong measures mean a raising of the rate of discount to a percentage that paralyzes industry, manufactures, and commerce, and opens the door to new losses, disaster, and troubles. £16,000,000—sixteen million pounds sterling of gold was shipped to America between August 1 and December 31, 1879, partly from France and partly from this country; and the Daily News\' article proceeds: ""If France refuses to send gold, our only course is to raise the rate of interest to a point which will, if it does not prevent the drain to America, attract gold from all the odd corners of the earth, and so compensate the drain upon our gold reserve."" The ""odd corners of the earth"" cannot be depended upon to afford such a compensation. The supply of gold from the Californian and Australian mines has fallen from thirty-six millions to less than twenty millions. But this deficit of sixteen or more millions in supply, does not show the full gravity of the loss as regards Great Britain in particular, and Europe generally. The great bulk of the Californian yield of gold came to England and Europe, until the United States Government resumed cash payments. Now none of that gold comes to us. It is intercepted in New York; and California is sending us wheat to be paid for in gold. The food demands of our population are yearly increasing, and unless the United States relax their protective tariffs, of which there is little or no hope, at least until their National Debt shall have been entirely paid off, the drain of gold from this country, Germany, &c., to America will yearly increase also. It is becoming, therefore, almost a matter of national safety for Great Britain to take the lead in obtaining increased supplies of gold; to swoop down upon and develop the resources of some rich gold fields hitherto untouched by European enterprise. The national need is so great, that we must heartily wish the fullest measure of success to those Indian mines which have been of late so greatly in favour with the public or with speculators but it would be most absurd to suppose that they could supply the recognized deficiency. We believe that the Gold Coast of West Africa can do very much toward it, and will do this so soon as measures adequate to the greatness of the emergency and the want are adopted.

The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence. When we think of how much has been effected in the consolidation and extension of our Gold Coast territories since 1871, we may confidently hope for a further extension and a great future for this rich and important possession. The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

Although our connexion with it has been for a period approaching two and a-half centuries, so little notice has been given to it that it is in almost as undeveloped a state as when we first came into contact with its peoples. Perusal of the letters and articles from correspondents who recently accompanied the Ashanti expedition on its march from Cape Coast Castle to Coomassie brings forcibly to one\'s mind how sadly we have been lacking in our duty in this sphere. Rich almost beyond compare in mineral and vegetable products, this field of wealth has been permitted to remain all but uncultivated. No strenuous efforts appear to have been made to open up the country; there are no roads to speak of, there are no facilities for inland transport—even at this day every gallon of palm oil, every hundredweight of rubber, every fathom of cloth, and every pound of gunpowder has to be carried on men\'s heads to and from the interior, and this in a land abounding in auriferous metal. One naturally asks—Why should this be so? The answer is not far to seek. There are several causes which account for the backwardness of the Colony, the main being the reputed unhealthiness of the climate. On this point there cannot be any doubt as to its not being favourable to Europeans, especially if they come here with constitutions in any way enervated by previous excesses, or if they indulge in excesses of any kind while here. It is imprudent for a white man to come to West Africa unless his constitution is perfectly sound and every organ in his body unimpaired; but if he is in perfect health, and will exercise ordinary care, take good food, live regularly, practice sobriety, work hard when he is at it, and will not (to use a vulgarism) funk when he has a touch of fever, he will run no greater risk on the Gold Coast than in other tropical countries. There are many Europeans known to the writer who have been in this country eight, ten, fifteen, twenty-five, and thirty years and more, with periodical visits home, and who in the majority of cases have remained in the Colony three, five, and seven years at a stretch; yet in none of these instances were the parties total abstainers, but they were temperate in all things and enjoyed perfect health. Yet these men lived in times when less attention was bestowed to sanitary matters. With ordinary care the healthy European runs no risk. Now the authorities are becoming alive to the necessities of better sanitation, and some efforts are being made to improve the sanitary condition of the principal sea-coast towns. That the country has suffered in no inconsiderable degree by its reputation for unhealthiness is evidenced by this passage which I cite from an official source: ""Against the development of the Colony by means of English capital there lies upon it the stigma of a baneful climate. But I cannot help thinking that by clearing the waterways of the Colony and thus improving the drainage of the country, by converting the bush tracks into decent roads and so improving the ventilation of the country, by a gradual conversion of the dense bush into cultivated areas, by the enforcement in the interior towns and villages of the sanitary laws which have proved so useful and advantageous in the coast towns, and by improving the means of transport, thereby enabling Europeans resident at a distance from the trade ports to have ready access to good food and the various comforts of civilisation to which they have been accustomed, and which they more than ever want in a tropical country—the climate of the Gold Coast will lose its notoriety, and the country will become, equally with other tropical countries, a safe means for the investment of capital."" But beside the climate the greatest hindrance to the rapid development of the country and its trade has been the want of proper means of transport. So long as the primitive method of carrying everything on the head prevails, the amount of trade must necessarily be narrowed still the volume of trade for 1894 shows an increase roughly of 13 per cent. over 1893 with the United Kingdom, and of 22 per cent. with foreign countries, being respectively £1,190,532 1s. 3d. against £1,054,386 17s. 6d., and £429,708 1s. 4d. and £350,387 3s. 5d. This gives one some idea of what the increase is certain to be when the produce-yielding districts of the colony are tapped by good roads and the ""iron horse."" The Government, it is said, are organising a roads department, and surveys have been made for railroads, none too soon, for they are indispensable in a country where cattle (including in that category horses, mules, and donkeys) will live only in certain localities. Irrespective of the necessity for roads and railways for produce, the same facilities for access to the gold mining districts cannot be lost sight of; it is the yellow metal which has given its name to the colony. Since the fifteenth century it is estimated that six or seven millions of gold have been exported from the goldfields. Anterior to the discovery of Australian or Californian gold the principal supply of the auriferous metal was obtained from the West Coast, in particular from this land. Whoever has travelled over the country has been struck with indications of the precious metal almost everywhere. It outcrops in reefs, it is discovered in sand, and found in the beds of its rivers; you will see it being washed for in the streets. Why, then, has not the country become a great gold mining centre? I doubt very much whether California itself ever presented to the naked eye the tempting wealth of gold which so forcibly attracts the attention of the traveller in the western districts of the Gold Coast. With plenty of capital for the developments of its properties and under European and native control, any enterprise for the development of the gold industry in this colony ought to be a substantial success.—*Liverpool Journal of Commerce.*', 'last_edit_date': '1896-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1896#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Boer social formations combined elements of the slave plantation, the feudal fief and the patriarchal community, in addition to capitalist commodity relations.

The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans. For the same reason, Africa was also prevented from developing direct trading links with other parts of the world such as India and China."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""Equally important and significant was the impact of colonialism on the primary sector of the economy. As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods. Thirdly, the growing of cash crops by Africans enabled individuals of whatever social status, especially in the rural areas, to acquire wealth."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism varied from area to area and from theme to theme. There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone.

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble', 'content': ""Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region.

When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form.

Its more advanced contingents were represented by workers in the industrial cities and ports. Most of the African labour in mining and in the cities was initially recruited from seasonal workers. Yet an increasing number of people came to depend on the seasonal occupation for their livelihood, and, over time, a process of labour stabilization occurred.

He had not to speak of unthought-of prospects for their trade and fresh fields for philanthropic work. He proposed to carry them into the classic lands of African exploration, redolent of memories in connexion with Park, Clapperton, Denham, Lander, Barth, and a host of others. His object was to remind them of the heritage bequeathed to the British through the enterprise of those great travellers, and won at the cost of manifold hardships. He undertook the task more readily as there seemed to be an incredible amount of ignorance with regard to the Central Soudan. Few are aware of the existence of semi-civilized negro empires in the very heart of Africa, and the names of Sokoto, Kano, Kukawa, Yakoba, Illorin, and Bida are known but to the student. The geographical knowledge of the many is restricted to a hazy idea of the existence of a town named Timbuctoo, near which the Niger flows on its way to the Atlantic. It must not, however, be imagined, though the world was thus ignorant of this important region, that it had been utterly ignored and left untouched. Far from it. For years past the National African Company has been at work establishing itself on the river. From point to point it has worked its way, till its factories extend far into the very heart of the continent. Till lately the Company had been content to feel its way, laying a solid commercial basis in each district before entering into the heart of Central Africa. With the rise of the African craze and the scramble for Africa, it became of importance that the position of the Company should be secured, lest the labours of half a century should be ruined by some startling development of foreign commercial enterprise. Communication must be opened up with the two great Sultans—viz., Maliké of Gandu and Umuru of Sokoto—into whose territories the Company had found its way. To undertake this work he had been selected, and he embraced the opportunity of seeing something of Western Africa and the Niger basin. Thus it was that he transferred himself from his field of research in Eastern Africa to the other side of the continent. Speaking of the gin trade on the coast, he said that it was a scandal and a shame. Having reached the town of Rabba, the furthest factory of the National African Company, preparations were made for the land journey. The caravan consisted of three Europeans—Mr. Thomson, Mr. Hamilton, his companion from England, and Mr. W. J. Seags, who took charge of the financial matters of the expedition. Then followed two educated Coast natives. The rest of the caravan consisted of natives—Brassmen, Kruboys, and Fantees, from Akra and Elmina. On the 9th of April the caravan set out, taking the road which leads to Koutokora, in the hope that they might proceed direct to Sokoto instead of having to take the circuitous river route. On reaching Jega, we were on the great trade route which connects Timbuctoo and the Western Soudan with Bornu, and the kingdoms of the Chad region. Hitherto we had passed through sparsely populated districts, or countries desolated by war. Now, however, we had reached a healthy densely populated part, which throbbed with commercial activity. The enormous trade carried on along this trunk line was to me a never-failing source of wonderment, so unlike was it to anything I had elsewhere seen or imagined.

Mr. Marshall wanted the shareholders to provide the money to fight the liquidators in the Court of Chancery. He could only hope that any fighting would be at the expense of Mr. Marshall and his committee.

From the poverty-stricken condition of the Free State Government, and for political reasons, I fear the duties will not be arranged in anything like a satisfactory manner for the traders, and if the French and Portuguese Governments follow suit, there is no saying where the thing will end; but of this we are certain, a great blow will be given to English enterprise, and we know that neither French nor Portuguese capitalists will put money in these colonies. Belgian capital is out of the question altogether; the Free State seems to be regarded as a hobby or a speculation of the King. How long will it take to open up the Dark Continent to the boasted advantages of civilisation if the pioneers are to be hampered and hindered by the Governments who ought to help them to the utmost?""\n\nIt may be asked why Holland should especially bestir itself in Congo matters more than other nations? The reason is that the Dutch joint-stock company, De Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels Vennootschap, exports seven-eighths of the total produce of the Congo; its shares are in the hands of numerous holders; it is one of the oldest European establishments in that region, and has a character, an organisation, and a prospect higher than it ever previously possessed.\n\nThe duty which Holland is striving to fulfil with respect to her African Trading Company has its counterpart in England. We Englishmen have also compatriots whose history has been similar to that of the Dutch company. Though not possessing such an extensive interest, their establishments are spread over the territory claimed by the Portuguese and the French. These Powers may follow suit if the present encroachments be not resisted, and it behoves our Government to see that our merchants do not suffer through the proposed innovations. But Governments will not, cannot, act unless moved from outside, and the traders of the Congo district thoroughly realise this fact.

The difficulties of the earlier period of Niger trade were renewed upon a larger scale. It was no longer a question merely of commercial firms competing against each other, but threatened to take the proportions of an international struggle for pre-eminence.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Twenty Years in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Prior to 1876—the year from which we may date the new advance in West Africa—much, of course, had been discovered about the territory which was presently to be parcelled out among continental aspirants for colonial empires and this country. Livingstone and Stanley had been busily occupied filling up the map. The secret of the source of the Niger had long been known, and the river itself had been left, in the main, to numerous private traders, who had competed keenly one with another. In 1879 the whole of the English firms doing business on the river coalesced and formed one large company, under the name of the United or National African Company. This combination was a part, and no small part, of the new European movement in Africa. It was formed to combat foreign competition, which had been growing at a rate that augured badly for British interests if resources and efforts remained divided. In this connexion, and in illustration of the view that Africa is being at last treated as a continent, as a theatre of empire and a means of national aggrandisement, Mr. Lucas notes what European peoples were once strong in Africa, and who are they that now prevail.\n\n""The Portuguese,"" he says, ""are still there, but with only a shadow of their former strength; the English are there; the French are there. One European Power, the Dutch, for many years the strongest of all, has now no place at all in Africa, though the Dutch race is perpetuated in the south, under English or Republican Government. On the other hand, the Germans, who, except for the few years when the Brandenburghers traded on the Guinea Coast, never had any footing in Africa, have lately taken a prominent position among the Europeans who are in so lordly a manner slicing up the continent. The Dutch were, above all others, a trading and carrying people. They went to Africa—at any rate, to West Africa—as carriers, and when the carrying trade over the Atlantic came to an end their connexions with West Africa gradually died away. Weak as Holland is when compared with Great Britain, or France, or Germany, she still holds her East Indian and West Indian possessions; but since West Africa has ceased to be what she once was, the scene of a series of depôts from which ships fetched human wares, she has left the Guinea Coast apparently for ever. Meanwhile, a new Power—Germany—has made its appearance. The Germans, no doubt, like all other peoples, look in their colonial enterprises to securing trade for the mother country; but they have taken their place in Africa under, and in full harmony with, the new set of conditions. They have come there as a continental people to a continent, not as a sea-going merchant people to a coast. They have come, not like the Prussians of old, to build and hold on sufferance small factories, but to rule, or claim to rule, to protect, or claim to protect, large areas of territory.

Human interest, resting in Europe upon the strong fulcrum of human wants, is the mighty lever that God has clearly ordained for lifting the great continent of Africa to the position she has been endowed for. She has passed rapidly, though it may seem to have been slowly, through the earlier stages of her elevation. The epoch of more potent effort has now arrived. Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it. Just as powerful European organizations prosecuted the slave-trade in Africa which individual cupidity desultorily commenced, and thus gave to that accursed traffic the enormous development to which it attained, so will powerful European organizations now take the field in giving development to that legitimate commerce for which Africa possesses so many rich and copious elements. A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array. Companies with too restricted capital can only do the same sort of work that individual merchants have been and are performing. This was and is useful enough for Africa, and beneficial to the merchant, as far as it can prudently go. But Africa now wants more than this. She wants powerful companies, that shall prudently but boldly stimulate and assist her to a much higher and more extensive industrial development. The Company of African Merchants is, and is intended to be, such an one. That it will open to England the great national storehouses of African cotton, we have no doubt; while it will be at the same time be helping forward and reaping other portions of its harvests in the long-opened fields of oils, gums, and other such articles of African produce. We long to see it, and we hope that we shall see it and kindred efficient organizations, take hold of certain richly-endowed districts of Africa with a firm and solid grasp—with a determination to squeeze from them their abundant natural stores, enriching them and elevating them morally and socially in the process—with a firm resolve to employ all those wealth-creating means which advancing civilization in Europe has gradually discovered and applied for stimulating industry and diffusing wealth, comfort, peace, and happiness, among mankind.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What the Royal Niger Company is Doing for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It should be borne in mind by those who look for quick and fabulous returns from their investments that Africa occupies a singular position.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products. By-and-by, when they are taught, they will begin to cultivate the soil and raise products which are in demand in Europe. Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world.

The natives are more and more disposed to bring down produce to the coast stations, and time is no object to them. Companies with large resources and independent of banking restrictions have many advantages in carrying on a trade which is necessarily irregular. The capital of trading companies should be mainly in the floating form, to be increased or withdrawn according to the opportunities for its employment.

The writer criticises somewhat severely, though in a friendly tone, the policy pursued by France towards its colonial possessions in general, and those in Africa in particular. This, with the frequent changes in policy natural to a Government which is always being changed, has ""prevented them from attaining the prosperity at which they might otherwise have arrived."" As for England, her policy is described as prevailing not only in the ten colonies which she owns in the continent, but almost everywhere throughout the central and equatorial parts of it. The Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and German possessions are then mentioned, and a claim is put in on behalf of Belgium, not, indeed to actual territorial possession, but to a number of commercial settlements owning some local property. It is, as the Belgians assert, their legitimate boast that, on the initiative of King Leopold II, they opened the Congo to the navigation of the world. It is, therefore, with this part of Africa that they have the most to do. They have established a joint-stock company, called the ""Belgian Company of African Commerce,"" which was incorporated in March, 1882, with a capital of 10,000l. Of this sum about 2,000l. was spent in the purchase of the vessel Akassa, which is, no doubt, destined to do wonders on the Congo river. It is intended to increase the company till it has a capital of 600,000 francs, and ultimately two or even five millions of francs. At present it seems that the subscribers to it are chiefly English.

What the newly chartered East Africa Company are proposing to accomplish on the East Coast, the Royal Niger Company are doing on the West, and apparently with more success than the colonial Governments which draw their life from Downing-street. Lord Aberdare is Governor of the Royal Niger Company, and Sir George Taubman-Goldie Deputy-Governor; and in conversation with the latter a representative elicited some information as to the operations of the corporation. First of all, as to the difficulties which such companies have to encounter, they may be put down under three heads. The first great obstacle is this, that negroes have everything to learn. They have been accustomed hitherto to supply their immediate wants, and nothing more, so that beyond this minimum they have to be taught everything. It is slow work to teach them how to produce articles which are in request in Europe. A trade has been gradually growing up, but that only extends to certain regions, and, unfortunately for Western Africa, the articles of trade which have thus come into use—palm oil, for instance—have fallen very largely in price, as much as 50 per cent. That has been one of the great difficulties of the past three or four years. In the second place, there is the labour difficulty. Being unaccustomed to labour, they are averse to it. The Niger Company has had less to contend with in this respect than those in other parts of Africa, for although the natives near the coast are naturally idle, those in the interior are of more industrious habits. Some day imported labour will be necessary—either Chinese or coolie—not to extirpate the natives, but to serve as an example. The third great difficulty is the climate. Near the seaboard the country is undoubtedly pestilential. As you leave the mangrove swamps and palm forests behind and reach the interior, you come to a climate which, while totally unfit for European colonization, is fully as healthy as many parts of India. The difficulties arising from the climate are, therefore, not insuperable, if proper precautions are taken.\n\nWith respect to European jealousies and interference, there seems no ground for alarm on that score. The newspapers have reported that German merchants have complained of the administration of the Niger Company, but as a matter of fact there is not a single German trader in the whole of the Company's territory. There was one some time ago, but he was tried and deported by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., for a long period Chief Justice of the Gold Coast Colony, and now of the Niger territories. His offence was inciting the natives to rebellion and bloodshed. The whole case of the German Colonial Society in Berlin thus falls to the ground."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1888#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL COMPANIES FOR AFRICAN TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But it takes so long to undo evil, and destroy its baneful venom among mankind, that the infamous slave-trade, though scotched, is not yet killed.

We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trading operations of Europeans in West Africa are carried on after the following manner: The trader selects a site suitable—generally by the side of a river or creek, or along the seashore—and comes to terms with the owner of the soil or the native chief of the district for the leasing of the land, the natives retaining a dislike to alienating any part of their country.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

The Chairman, in moving the adoption of the report, which stated that the directors could not pay any dividend or write off any depreciations, said they were disappointed that they had to make such an unsatisfactory return. It had arisen entirely from their having to take even lower rates of freight than the previous year. They had not made the reduction without consideration, and in unison with the British and African Steam Navigation Company. It had been forced upon them, otherwise both companies would have had to fight with still more serious opposition. During the past twelve months the opposition had been conducted by people, not in themselves powerful, but there were so many steamers seeking employment that there was no great difficulty in finding owners willing to entrust their vessels to them. The steam-shipping trade at the present time was in a very depressed state. How long it would be before a better state of affairs prevails, it was really impossible to say. They had all a large stake in the undertaking, and they would like to get something out of it. They had done all they could to reduce the expenses without injuring the efficiency of the ships, and with due consideration for the lives of those on board. They did not feel justified in sending ships to the coast of Africa without doctors on board. The opposition steamers went without incurring this expense, and without considering what the effect would be if any serious illness broke out. He (the Chairman) did not think there was anything further in connexion with the accounts, but he would like to say a word or two about the Berlin Conference. He thought all the English people engaged in the African trade were satisfied with the result of the Conference. The claims of Portugal had been partly conceded by allowing her to have the south coast of the Congo two or three hundred miles along the coast and for some distance inland, but it had been made conditional on their not interfering with the free navigation of the Lower Congo, and they would not be allowed to levy any rates except such as be agreed upon by an International Commission. With regard to the Upper Congo, they would have seen it had been constituted into a Free State mainly under the care of the King of the Belgians, who would appoint a Governor to it. They were given to understand that the King of the Belgians and Mr. Stanley had been satisfied with respect to the engagements in regard to the Lower Congo, so that they would endeavour to raise the capital for making the railway between the Upper and Lower Congo. With regard to the occupation of Cameroons, the Germans had agreed that the same duties would be levied on foreign as German ships. With regard to the palm oil rivers, the English protectorate had been recognized all along the line. A strong attempt had been made to get the Niger ruled by an International Commission, the same as the Congo. That had been resisted by the English Government, as the Niger had been opened entirely by British enterprise and capital. The British Government were now responsible for the peace of the Niger, and had agreed that it should be open to all nations alike, so that foreigners could have the same privileges as the English. At the last meeting of the company one of their most influential proprietors called attention to the Niger, and suggested that steamers should run up the Niger. He (the Chairman) wanted to repeat that the National African Company being one of their largest customers, it was in the interest of all not to interfere with the river in that way so long as the National African Company gave them all their carrying. There was one question which he admitted in speaking of the causes of the reduced rates. There were some merchants in Liverpool who had never supported the opposition, directly or indirectly; whilst others fostered the opposition for the sake of pulling down the freights. In the face of this, the companies reduced the rates for their loyal supporters, and brought the freights to the level of the opposition. The directors hoped, if things improved, to get a slight increase in the freights, and with improvement in trade to give a better result than they had done for some time past.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""All these guiding principles were made clear, explicitly or implicitly, to the colonial administrators. But there was an equally important assumption which seems to have been confused by some colonial administrators and other apologists of colonialism and this is the fact that the British, like other colonizers, went out to the colonies primarily, if not exclusively, to enrich themselves and promote their own interests. The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas. Such a state of affairs was in no way a peculiarity of a few colonies. It was the normal reality of colonial economic relations.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Gold was mined in the Gold Coast, Southern Rhodesia, Tanganyika and Sierra Leone. Diamonds became an important industry in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast. Copper mining was restricted to Northern Rhodesia, while iron-ore mining remained a speciality of Sierra Leone. Only Nigeria and Southern Rhodesia mined coal, an important source of power. Most terri› tories had one or two minerals, only Southern Rhodesia and Sierra Leone had a variety. Starting with platinum and gold in 1929, by the mid-i930s Sierra Leone was mining, in addition, chrome ore, iron ore and diamonds.\nThe discovery of mineral deposits in the countries under discussion was not a fortuitous affair of the colonial period. Either minerals had been known and worked long before the colonial era, or deposits were found by men who were specifically searching for minerals. Before the colonial era both Southern Rhodesia and the Gold Coast, where the local population had mined and worked gold for generations, were noted for their potential mineral wealth rather than their agricultural prospects. In Nigeria, too, the local population had mined and worked tin for generations before the white men penetrated the interior. Thus in a number of cases prospecting during the colonial period started with locating areas where mining had been carried out by the local population. Expectations of growing rich overnight attracted many Europeans and much capital into Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, but a 'Second Rand' was not found, only small deposits being located.

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > National prestige', 'content': ""The greatest exponent of this theory is Carlton Hayes.

European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region.

When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika.

They will be able to trace much of their onward progress clearly up to the 6th April, 1872, when the Dutch flag was lowered and that of England hoisted in its place amid salvos of artillery and other fitting demonstrations. The whole of the sea-coast from Asinee to Popo is now under one sole and only protection and jurisdiction. One of our great desires is thus realized. There is now no longer a European patron of Fetish and many other abominations on one side of a river, and on the other another European power, which, whatever its faults and shortcomings, has persistently endeavoured to put an end to such horrors wherever its powers could be made to extend. The evils caused, and the possibility of good prevented by the presence of the Dutch on the Gold Coast, it would be difficult to overstate. It is indeed, therefore, a matter for congratulation that they have definitively withdrawn from all their former possessions there, and that there is at least no longer any European influence to neutralize such efforts as Great Britain may make, and encourage to be made, for promoting the spread of Christian civilization and the development of the magnificent resources of countries which we feel sure are destined to furnish rich supplies to the ever-craving markets of Europe. A sincere and generous recognition and adoption of the Fanti Confederation as a co-worker under British auspices, will do much to hasten both the civilization and development.

We accept this as a good augury. Success in first operations tends greatly to strengthen new institutions. The Fanti Confederation had a great success, and we believe that, by God's blessing, it will, under British guidance and with effective British support, show us also within a short time magnificent victories of peace—victories tending to avert war in the future, and to introduce a wide-spread happiness among populations which have been for ages past victims of the most deplorable calamities.""}, {'id': 2553, 'article_title': 'THE ASHANTI WAR', 'full_section_title': 'THE ASHANTI WAR', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-19', 'issue_date': '29_08_1873', 'content': '\n\nwith such others as the present authorities at Lagos may be able to spare, are to form Captain Glover\'s body guard, and the nucleus of a corps of natives, as already mentioned. To all who know anything of the Gold Coast people, it will be at once evident that the mutual relations between them and Captain Glover cannot be the same as between him and the Houssas. We merely state this to prevent exaggerated expectations, and in justice to Captain Glover himself, should he not succeed to the extent anticipated by his admirers. Knowing that Captain Glover was thus appointed, it became our duty to obtain information as to his proposed operations. It was not our intention, however (as the African Times is something more than a mere newspaper), to have published what we learned on this head, because it is but too well-established a fact that the Ashanti monarch is rapidly made acquainted with public intelligence that may affect him from the side of the Gold Coast. But the Standard, of the 16th, having published what we have copied into another column, we are relieved from all restraint. It is intended, as therein stated, that Captain Glover shall operate from the Volta; but not, we believe, as there further stated, on the flank and rear of the Ashanti forces now in the protected territories. If we are correctly informed, a more decisive measure than this is contemplated—viz., that he should endeavour to penetrate on that side to Coomassie (or Kumasi), the capital of Ashanti, now supposed to be denuded of its defenders by the exigencies of the Gold Coast invasion. We presume, therefore, that he intends to recruit among the Croboes. There can be no doubt that, should it be found practicable to reach Coomassie (and we believe that the question of food supply is the greatest difficulty to be overcome), a decisive blow may be struck at the Ashanti power, and that disturber of the peace, prosperity, and progress of the Gold Coast territories be made incapable of further mischief. A second expedition to Coomassie has been proposed to be made from the side of Appolonia and the Assinee River, tributaries of which are said to be navigable by boats to the Ashanti capital. This route was first publicly broached in connection with the name of Col. Sir Garnet Wolseley, since appointed to be Administrator at Cape Coast, and Commander-in-Chief of all the forces to be employed against the Ashantis. Whether there is to be this second and simultaneous advance on Coomassie, we are not at present in a position to state; but as there seems to be now a full determination to deal seriously with the faithless Ashantis, and as Great Britain ought not to have a ""little war,"" the most effective means for terminating that into which the Ashantis have forced us ought undoubtedly to be employed. It must not be supposed for a moment that advances such as we have alluded to can be made toward Coomassie from the side of the Volta and the Assinee without information of them reaching the King. In this case, and unless the available force of Ashanti be greater than has been supposed by the best authorities, it must be deemed probable that the King will order the immediate return to Coomassie of his forces now in the neighbourhood of Cape Coast and Elmina; and should he do so, it may surely also be deemed probable that a picked force of the Fantis and Accras will act against the rear of the retreating army, even to Coomassie; to meet there the other two corps, and thus accomplish such a subjection of the country as may insure future peace and tranquillity. Should this be accomplished, the great road, of which we have so long in vain urged the construction, must be made not to the River Prah only, but to Coomassie. The contemplated military operations and the simultaneous and subsequent necessary public works will involve considerable outlay; but this outlay will not be, as in the case of Abyssinia, without reward. They will open an interior, from which incalculable wealth must flow to the Coast. The great treasures of gold will be unclosed; the productive energies of peoples who have been hitherto barred by the Ashantis from all access to the sea will be stimulated, and those who have for many years pooh-poohed the West African Settlements, will wonder that the British Government should have been so slow to recognize their importance. It is absurd to suppose for a moment that we cannot occupy Coomassie if we have determined to do so. The arm that reached King Theodore in Abyssinia is not yet shortened. All that we need is a fixed and determined will, and the realization must soon follow the resolve.'}, {'id': 2595, 'article_title': 'THE ASHANTI WAR.—GOLD, GOLD, GOLD!', 'full_section_title': 'THE ASHANTI WAR.—GOLD, GOLD, GOLD!', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_10_1873#article-10', 'issue_date': '30_10_1873', 'content': 'We hope great results from the Ashanti War. The iniquity of Ashanti has overflowed towards the Coast. Without provocation, in search of plunder, victims for its atrocious sacrifices, and permanent dominion if possible, it has flooded into the Protected Territories, and overrun a considerable portion of them. It would not have done this, or even attempted it, had the roads we have so long asked for been made, and had the Fanti Confederation been accepted and utilized by the local Government. Having attempted it, it might have been driven back at the outset, but that we had an evil policy and inefficient authority. We thus delivered up the whole country, until within five or six miles of the Cape Coast Castle, to the enemy. Bearded at last in our dens on the Coast, we had no alternative but to fight. Thus it is we have an Ashanti War. It will cost money, of course; and unhappily, we fear, many valuable lives. It is possible there is some excess of preparation going on, but this is an error in the right direction, if there be error at all in it; because the season during which alone active warfare is possible is rather a brief one for the campaign, which is evidently contemplated to extend to a distance of nearly 200 miles. Government has been loudly called on, and in this instance we think unfairly, to explain what they intend to do, and what is the limit of their views and purposes. This could at best be only answered in general terms, which we suppose would be, ""to clear the Protected Territories of the enemy, and inflict on them such a chastisement as would prevent their rendering it necessary for us to repeat the lesson."" Nothing can be more clear than that we cannot stop short of this result. We must draw the teeth and cut the claws effectually this time. Ashanti is a ferocious, stealthy, and treacherous wild beast. As such she must be treated, even if we have to follow her to her lair at Kumassie. It is not at all certain that we shall have to do this. It is possible that her associate beasts may spring upon and destroy her at our approach. But whether this happen, or whether we have to force her lair, we hold it to be quite impossible for either Her Majesty\'s Government or their Commander in the operations, to decide at this time what must then follow. That must manifestly depend on circumstances. The present Emperor of Germany did not intend, when his army crossed the Rhine, to annex Alsace and Lorraine; or demand two hundred million sterling from the vanquished. Those results grew out of the military operations. When our forces cross the Prah, it will be to repel aggression, and, if possible, to provide against future aggressions, and we must accept the contingencies which after-events may lead to. Sir Charles Adderley says, ""If the Conservatives had been in power the last six months, there would have been no Ashanti War."" This is absurd. It was the policy of Sir C. Adderley\'s Committee that distinctly led up to this war; and we certainly have not found Conservative-appointed Governors on the Coast, one whit more capable than Liberal-appointed ones. Then Lord Derby hopes that ""no visionary ideas of a vast tropical empire in Africa—no exaggerated fancies as to its being our duty to put a coat of moral whitewash on every black man we come across—will lead us to extend still further our Protectorate."" We do not know what our great philosophical statesman means by the ""coat of moral whitewash."" If he means such a result as has been obtained in the Protected Territories by and through our influence—namely, the putting an end for many years to human sacrifices—if he means this, we confess we, at least, do entertain such visionary ideas. But as regards a vast tropical empire, without entertaining any visionary ideas, we do not deem this to be a more impossible result than was Alsace and Lorraine, and the two hundred millions, as the result of the Franco-German War. The great question with our public men in the present age is certain to be, ""Will it pay?"" If it should be proved that ""a vast tropical empire"" would pay, we shall no doubt see it commenced, and gradually established. As regards this question of ""pay,"" Sir Chas. Adderley lays it down as certain that even if we are successful (in the war), the result will be valueless."" Here, as in our remarks on Lord Derby\'s speech, we must revert to the subject of human sacrifices, and affirm that if our operations should so cripple Ashanti, that the vast population beyond, in the interior, which now pay to her the constant heavy tribute of human victims for her horrible human sacrifices, should be freed from that tribute, the result will not have been valueless for a nation that still desires to be called a Christian one. But here we may further express the hope, that if our occupation of Kumassie be only a fugitive one, it will be valuable, and not valueless, in results. It will be so if it lead to a way being opened by which the populations beyond Ashanti may be supplied with arms for their defence against the Ashantis in their victim hunts. It would be a great stroke of policy to effect this, But we suppose Sir C. Adderley meant that, in a pecuniary and commercial point of view, the ""results would be valueless."" This brings us again to the question, ""Will it pay?"" Now it should never be for one moment forgotten that Ashanti and neighbouring territories, and the Kong Mountain range beyond, constitute, probably, with the Protected Territories, one of the richest gold-fields in the world.

So much for history. But history, unless accompanied by an indication of the subtle occult influences which are brought to bear on human affairs, and control the decisions of Governments, must ever be a bald and imperfect record of events. The late proposed Treaty for exchange of English and French possessions and claims on the West Coast of Africa is most certainly far from presenting an exception to this rule. The published conditions of that proposed Treaty seemed to be so exceptionally favourable and advantageous for France, owing to the enlightened desire of the British Government to spread the blessings of civilization among the populations of the Gold Coast, that it was almost inconceivable any obstacle to its conclusion should proceed from France. Nevertheless, while the varied British interests at the Gambia, native and European, social and mercantile, were loud in their condemnation, and we ourselves were contending that the French concessions should be far more extensive and complete, an occult influence was working so successfully in France as to lead the Government of that country to withdraw from the inadequate concessions which formed the basis of its previous negotiations with Great Britain. Not content with obtaining the grand substance of the Gambia, with neighbouring rivers, and an unsurpassed territory, in exchange for shadowy claims, not of any national importance, it has been induced, or we may rather say seduced, to fix its regards so much on the shadow, that the substance has, for the present at least, escaped its grasp. We say ""for the present,"" because the possession of the Gambia is of so great importance to France for utilizing and making productive its expenditure on the Senegal, that we feel persuaded it will soon burst the bonds of its delusion, and again seek eagerly to obtain what it has now depreciated, even at the cost of those more extensive and complete concessions which we pointed out in our last month\'s paper as indispensable to the full realization of that very important object—equally important to France and to Great Britain—of removing, so far as human foresight is concerned, every possible cause of future complications and differences between these two great Powers as regards the West Coast of Africa. Not many days after the publication of our last number, it began to be rumoured that the Government of France was beginning to entertain scruples about withdrawing from its shadowy claims (for it has no territorial possession there) on the coast of Dahomey and its neighbourhood. We could not at first believe in the possibility of any Government making so great a mistake. True, it was not in Oxenstein\'s time alone that the want of common sense in the conduct of the affairs of nations had made itself painfully manifest; still, that absence of common sense can never fail to fill the on-lookers with surprise, and arouse their incredulity. When, however, the Earl of Carnarvon made, in the House of Lords, that statement which will be found in our Parliamentary intelligence, though our surprise was in no degree diminished, our incredulity was of course at an end. The Government of France had been moved to prefer stopping the way to the civilizing influences of the British Government at the Gold Coast, and this without one particle of national benefit for France, rather than even to obtain possession of that Gambia which would unquestionably bring to France great national advantage. The question immediately suggested itself, whence this change? We saw at once, in a moment, the old Marseilles foreign slave-trade influence at work; that influence which worked so hard to prolong its existence at Whydah, even when Great Britain had almost put an end to the hideous slave-trade from all other parts of the West Coast. The old Marseilles slave-traders retain their affection and friendship for that humane and estimable monarch, the King of Dahomey; they find their advantage, no doubt, in supplying him with those warlike stores that enable him to continue his devastating raids into neighbouring interior territories, that of Egba among others; thus finding employment for his blood-thirsty army, and victims for the disgusting and horrible annual customs, which have been too often described to make it necessary for us to do more than merely allude to them as among the vile abominations of the earth, yet to be removed by the progress of Christian civilization. These old slave-traders have so overrated to the Government of France the importance to that country of the trade they are carrying on at Whydah, Popo, Angwy, and Porto Novo—a trade which, with the exception of so much of it as consists of warlike stores, they could carry on just as well under British authority and protection at those places, even as they do now, with the British Port of Lagos as their base of operations—that the Government was induced, under the influence also of their further representation that Great Britain would be content with Assinee and Grand Bassam, if it found that it could not get more, to put forward those obstacles to the completion of the Treaty which have, unexpectedly by the French Government, proved fatal to it. The Earl of Carnarvon had, with that frankness which becomes a British statesman, made a full public exposure of the advantages he expected to secure for the Gold Coast countries by the proposed Treaty. He was, perhaps, compelled to do this in answer to the various opposing interests in London, Liverpool, Manchester, and at the Gambia. His lordship even, perhaps, exaggerated those advantages for greater effect, believing, no doubt, that the only obstacles in his way were the British and native Gambia ones. But that this should have deceived the Government of France to the absurd belief which the old slave-trading interest was striving to induce, gives us, we are bound to confess, but a very mean estimate of talent in those who compose it and conduct its affairs. That they should have failed to comprehend the difficulties which had surged up in the path of the British Secretary of State for the Colonies to impede the conclusion of the proposed Treaty by Great Britain, shows either a very inferior class of intellect or a very imperfect information. It is well known how ardently France has desired to acquire the Gambia; and yet, at the critical moment, when the British Secretary of State needed all possible support to enable him to give up that Gambia to France, the Government of that country, instead of doing everything in its power to assist the British Secretary in carrying out the preconcerted plan, raised an absurd difficulty which gave to the British Government the power of getting rid of its real and serious difficulty in the matter, by withdrawing from the negotiations in toto, and thus putting an end to the proposed Treaty. The Earl of Carnarvon has told us in the House of Lords that he availed himself of this power. But what has the Government of France gained thereby? Nothing for France—but only a continuance of privilege to one or two houses at Marseilles to sell arms and gunpowder at Assinee and Grand Bassam, and, above all, to his Majesty of Dahomey. In a word, France has been sacrificed in the matter for the benefit of a very narrow mercantile interest, with the odium that must henceforward attach to an impeder of Christian civilization, and an upholder of what, in Dahomey, is an insult to humanity, and a scandal to the world at large. With regard to our native friends at the Gambia, and the British merchants having interests there, we congratulate them on their unexpected victory. For the present, at least, all their apprehensions are at an end. But what is their future to be? Are they to drag on in the way they have hitherto done, without the application by the Imperial Government of any sufficient means to develop those great resources of their noble river which have been so largely boasted of during the late discussions; or are such means to be now applied?

In consequence of steps taken by German officers in the eastern half of the zone, which appeared to amount to a negation of the principles of the agreement, further steps were necessarily taken on the British side of the territory in question in 1895-96-97. The occupation of some of the more important points within the zone has been forced upon us, and as a matter of fact all that remains with regard to the agreement of 1888 is to regularise by international arrangement, in the interests of both parties concerned, the results of the inevitable development which has been taking place. A portion of the German colonial Press is now asking for a division of the neutral zone on the basis of treaties negotiated within the neutral territory by Dr. Grüner and Captain von François. Practically, the German local authorities of Togoland annulled the agreement of 1888 by actions which involved the exercise of German sovereignty within the zone in 1895 and again in 1896. It is from every point of view desirable that the arrangement should be now brought formally to an end, and that in the hinterland of the Gold Coast France and England should have only each other to consider.\n\nIn the Hinterland of Lagos, where some of the present complications have been caused, not by the presence of a foreign claimant to territory lying within the lines of presumable British influence, but by a difference in the existing forms of British administration, it is possible that a further simplification of the problems under discussion may also before long be brought about.\n\nThe territory which the Royal Niger Company has been the instrument of bringing under British influence is too vast, too rich, and too important to remain for ever under the administration of a Chartered Company.

It becomes a question of time when the Imperial resources should be used, and it may be gathered from recent utterances of Lord Salisbury that the time is not, in his opinion, far distant. Lord Salisbury had no complaint to make of the administration of the Company.

Even so. And this does not rest upon our testimony alone; it is no discovery of ours. We do but bring forward well-known facts. Year after year, until the years count by centuries, the driblets we write of have been coming into Europe. At one time they furnished its chief supply. History says they amounted some 150 years ago to 3,500,000l. sterling a-year.* Now, in 1863, the total to Europe and America does not probably exceed 700,000l., or 800,000l. The decrease is not the result of exhaustion of metal, but of exhaustion of labourers. The population even 150 years ago was at least five times greater than it is now. Slave wars and the foreign slave-trade caused that exhaustion; as they had already, even at that remote period, reduced the inhabitants one half. At a moderate computation, it seems certain that since the Portuguese first began to import the precious metal from the Gold Coast, above 400 years ago, those lands lying between the sea and the Kong Mountains have furnished from 800 millions to 1,000 millions of pounds sterling of gold to the civilised world. And yet enlightened statesmen of the nineteenth century, because, through gross mismanagement, the Gold Coast costs for government and a shadow of defence some 20,000l. a-year more than has hitherto been raised by imposts, set their faces like flints against every proposition to make and maintain even one good road for vehicles from the Coast to the Ashantee frontier. Why, chiefly? Because they are only Protected Territories. As if Great Britain could ever abandon them; could leave them a prey to Ashantee on the one side, and slavetraders and piratical adventurers, or European rivals, on the other. She cannot leave them; let her, therefore, utilise them; let her benefit herself and them by that which they can yield. We know well that if self-interest will not induce us to make a colony of the Gold Coast, we were idle to appeal to any other feeling. If not, we should say some compunction ought to be felt with regard to territories that have literally lost through us and other European nations 800 millions sterling of treasure, and millions of their population. Lost; for what have they to show? What remains to them for that which they have thus parted with? Why countries thus endowed with wealth, and thus surrendering wealth, ought to have had at least roads, bridges, and cities to boast of. They have not one. But it is not too late. They will have them, and Great Britain must build them. They can pay her largely for them. Every fifty miles of roads and bridges, introducing and securing order, stability, progress, and enlightenment, will open a new mine of wealth. We claim for those territories, as a right, that they should be made a colony of the British Crown. Their future depends on this. They have no inherent power of self-regeneration. They are too deep in the filth of polygamy, slavery, and Devil worship to work out their own release. If they possess any arts, they are of the rudest and most primitive kind. They have neither art nor science of their own to aid them; nothing that will enable them, of themselves, to make a road, a bridge, a harbour, a breakwater, a secure roadstead—any one, in fact, of all those things that are indispensable for development and prosperity, for wealth and civilization. We claim for them, therefore, the right to be made a colony. We shall show in future articles that this may be done, not only without injustice to any, but with manifest and immense advantage to all. And we are convinced that if our public men could be brought so to give their attention to this question of making the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast a British colony as to arrive at a comprehension of the enormous national advantages that are to be obtained by so doing, the anomalous compromising character of our present relations with those territories would be put an end to by the yielding of Her Majesty's Government to an intelligent pressure for the immediate admission of those territories into the list of the colonial possessions of Great Britain."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The special report of Sir W. B. Griffith, the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, to Lord Knutsford will show how it comes that that coast has got its name. It has been known for centuries that gold existed in the rivers and the soil of the region immediately behind the coast, and in their own primitive way the natives have probably worked it from time immemorial. Moreover, at various times English companies have been floated for the purpose of mining the precious metal. Machinery has been sent out, and white men have been sent out to superintend it. But either the machinery never got out of the bush, where some of it may still be seen, or the works had to be abandoned from bad management or from the death of the white men who superintend them. Sir W. B. Griffith, in the report just issued, gives a melancholy list of the companies that have been started, got up capital, and come to grief in their efforts to utilise the gold of the Gold Coast. Happily the Governor has a more hopeful story to tell. His report is really the narrative of a journey he made up the Ancobra river in the early part of the present year, and of the various mines he visited which are being successfully carried out under white superintendence. He tells what he saw at the Akankoo, the Gie Appantoo, the Prestea, and other mines, where shafts have been sunk to considerable depths to get at the quartz, where machinery has been erected, stamps fitted up, Europeans are carrying on their work successfully, and hundreds of natives are employed. So far the yield of gold per ton has been moderate, but quite sufficient to give a fair profit on the outlay. The surface has as yet only been scratched, and further careful exploration, especially in the interior, might yield profitable results. Sir W. B. Griffith sums up the position succinctly and clearly. He is convinced that the country is rich in gold, and that it is merely a matter of the necessary time and scientific application for that gold to pay well for extraction. Earnest and well-considered attempts, he states, are now being made to secure success. The country once opened up and cultivated would yield rich returns to capital invested in the economic agriculture of any kind of tropical produce. But unfortunately—and this is the fatally weak point—the natives of the country cannot be relied upon to supply the necessary labour, which must come either from the Kroo country or from China. Chinese it would be a pity to introduce here. The Krooman are well known as the great workers of West Africa, and surely it need not be difficult to obtain a supply of them. At the same time, by patient and intelligent effort, the natives themselves might receive a stimulus to labour when once they saw it would be to their advantage. We believe that in this respect Governor Moloney has met with some success in Lagos. As to the suitability of the region for the residence of white men, we now know so well the conditions under which health can be maintained in the tropics that no man with a sound constitution to start with need come to grief if he give himself fair play. There is no doubt that the Gold Coast is a most trying region for white men, though the high ground of the interior ought to yield a much better climate.—Times.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-11-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_11_1889#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD COAST COLONY ROADS AND SEAPORT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'These would meet the immediate and, for a short time, prospective wants of the Gold Coast Colony, and conduce, through the improved port of Elmina, to a very largely increased production and commerce. Nor will they be at all beyond the means of the Government to effect. Whatever change they bring upon the revenue, will be soon met by a much more than corresponding increase of that revenue. Recent experience in all parts of the world has so fully established the sound economy of reproductive public works, that all argument on this point would be superfluous. The chief question is, how may these works be made most quickly reproductive; or, in other words, what is the order in which it would be most advantageous to execute them? If money, which means also all adequate supplies of materials, can be had in sufficient amount, if adequate intelligent supervision and adequate labour can be obtained for all these works to proceed at one and the same time, it would unquestionably be most rapidly beneficial to both development and revenue that they should be simultaneously commenced and prosecuted. If, however, this cannot be—though we are not at all convinced in our own mind that it cannot be—if only two of them could be managed to begin with, we should be inclined to suggest that these two be the road from the palm oil districts to Accra, and the port of Elmina. The Accra road might be made more or less productive, without the chain of communication between that place and Elmina; because, notwithstanding the difficulties with which the landing and embarkation of goods and produce is attended, means would, no doubt, be found for shipping a much larger quantity of produce than is at present put on board there. It will be seen that our belief is, that whenever the port of Elmina shall be made a good and safe landing and shipping place for produce and goods, it will be much more advantageous and economical to transport all produce and goods to and from Elmina and Accra, than to land and ship them through the dangerous and deteriorating surf which breaks so heavily at Accra. We are impatient to hear that the proper surveys and estimates are being made for the improvement of the port of Elmina, and that the important works there are to be undertaken without delay; because, when this is done, it will become at once evident to the meanest capacities that it will be necessary and profitable to construct also without delay the feeding lines of road. Great Britain is, we repeat, now on her trial before the nations as regards the Gold Coast Colony. Indisputably at the head of European industrial progress, indefatigable in efforts to assist in stimulating progress by the aid of science and capital in other European States, it would be an indelible disgrace to her to allow those Gold Coast countries which she has now taken under her absolute control to languish and stagnate for want of those accessories which she can so easily supply. To supply them would not entail on her one single penny of loss. It would be mere temporary aid from a rich parent to a poor child, who is naturally so endowed with the elements of wealth that the temporary aid cannot fail of the happiest results.

For many long years past, as is well known, our regards have been fixed upon the West African gold fields, as containing the fulcrum upon which the lever of West African progress, unless this were to continue at a very slow pace, must necessarily be placed. By their utilized resources we foresaw the introduction of railways, those mighty aids to the spread of civilization which alone could give that ready access to the interior necessary for the intercommunication of scattered tribes and peoples, now kept apart by ignorant and superstitious prejudices, and the lofty pretensions of petty barbarian rulers. It was scarcely possible that we could adequately stimulate that desired working of the gold fields, without ourself taking a personal interest in the work. Private pecuniary considerations have thus become mixed up with our ardent philanthropic and Christian desires and efforts. But although this combination of motives is a powerful one with us, there is another, a mighty one, that is constantly urging us on, and which is quite independent of and apart from that combination. This is a national one. That it is international as well as national where Great Britain is primarily concerned is inevitable. The position to which Great Britain has attained among the nations leads necessarily to this result. By her accumulating wealth, the produce of energy and enterprise in her people, she became the great financial centre of the civilized world. The fact—the unpalatable, but, alas! not less certain fact—that she is now tottering upon that lofty pinnacle, furnishes the national motive to which we have above alluded. And as she totters on the highest pinnacle, so do the minor European financial Powers totter also. The one ruin will involve that of all the others. In our number of January, this year, we pointed out ""that thoughtful minds were becoming troubled with the apprehension that as the greatest of nations have in the past suffered eclipse, so it may be in the future."" ""Europe,"" we continued, ""the actual centre of the world\'s civilizing power, is exhausting its resources and energies in armaments of preposterous magnitude, confiscating, at the bidding of vanity, ambition, covetousness, and fear, those results of human industry which ought daily to increase the sum of human happiness—heaping up mountains of explosives for the work of ruin and destruction, while the rumbling of the passion thunders of defrauded humanity which from time to time break sullenly upon the ears of misguided power, recall the existence of hidden forces, daily and hourly gathering in strength, that may overturn thrones and flood a continent with misery and woe. It seems to us useless and unwise to disguise the fact, although it is most generally ignored, that Europe, through the blindness of its rulers and the increasing wants of its rapidly augmenting populations, is being gradually despoiled of its money sceptre, which must ere long be transferred to that great Western Republic on which Europe and Great Britain in especial are becoming yearly more and more dependent for supplies of food. As Great Britain became the money centre of the world by the contributions which its manufacturing industries and the action of its spirit of enterprise drew from every portion of that world, so the United States of America—Great Britain having lost, and for ever, its manufacturing monopoly,—must and will inevitably become the money centre of the world, by the immense contributions it has been drawing, and will increasingly draw, through its supply of those necessaries of human existence which her vast territory enables her to furnish to the craving multitudes of the Old World. While Europe is committing suicide by her enormous armaments, the United States, having passed successfully through the fiery ordeal of her great Civil War, is husbanding her resources for the increase of production, manufacture, and commerce. The final result of this is certain, and now inevitable. The youthful giant will use its enormous strength without mercy; while the old ones will fall into comparative decrepitude, hastened by their abuse of the power with which they had been entrusted, by the wanton waste of their resources, by their pursuit of the phantoms of ambition, and their lust of extended empire, before which truth, righteousness, and justice were trampled under foot. It is not a pleasant prospect, it may not increase the world\'s happiness, it may produce an enormous crop of human suffering, but it cannot be got rid of by shutting our eyes and refusing to acknowledge its existence."" These opinions remain unchanged; they furnish the key to the national motive that actuates us as regards the great West African gold fields. In the absence of any others that can fairly pretend to compete with them, these hold out the only present prospect of safety for Great Britain. We refer our readers to, and ask their attentive perusal of, the extracts we publish from the Standard and Daily News. They will repay careful and thoughtful reading. The decrease of ""sixteen million pounds a year, or nearly one half of the gold supply a quarter of a century ago, is,"" as the Standard says, ""undoubtedly a very serious affair."" Nor are the following words from the Daily News less worthy of consideration: ""If the American drain be repeated upon anything like the scale of last autumn, we should be threatened with a total loss of the cash reserve of the country, and should have to take strong measures against such loss."" Strong measures mean a raising of the rate of discount to a percentage that paralyzes industry, manufactures, and commerce, and opens the door to new losses, disaster, and troubles. £16,000,000—sixteen million pounds sterling of gold was shipped to America between August 1 and December 31, 1879, partly from France and partly from this country; and the Daily News\' article proceeds: ""If France refuses to send gold, our only course is to raise the rate of interest to a point which will, if it does not prevent the drain to America, attract gold from all the odd corners of the earth, and so compensate the drain upon our gold reserve."" The ""odd corners of the earth"" cannot be depended upon to afford such a compensation. The supply of gold from the Californian and Australian mines has fallen from thirty-six millions to less than twenty millions. But this deficit of sixteen or more millions in supply, does not show the full gravity of the loss as regards Great Britain in particular, and Europe generally. The great bulk of the Californian yield of gold came to England and Europe, until the United States Government resumed cash payments. Now none of that gold comes to us. It is intercepted in New York; and California is sending us wheat to be paid for in gold. The food demands of our population are yearly increasing, and unless the United States relax their protective tariffs, of which there is little or no hope, at least until their National Debt shall have been entirely paid off, the drain of gold from this country, Germany, &c., to America will yearly increase also. It is becoming, therefore, almost a matter of national safety for Great Britain to take the lead in obtaining increased supplies of gold; to swoop down upon and develop the resources of some rich gold fields hitherto untouched by European enterprise. The national need is so great, that we must heartily wish the fullest measure of success to those Indian mines which have been of late so greatly in favour with the public or with speculators but it would be most absurd to suppose that they could supply the recognized deficiency. We believe that the Gold Coast of West Africa can do very much toward it, and will do this so soon as measures adequate to the greatness of the emergency and the want are adopted.

According to the writings of Bosman (1700) the Dutch appeared to be the principal traders and factors on the Coast, and to have built many of the chief forts. From the admissions of the author, they were adepts in the practice of cheating the Natives in their dealings with them for gold. The writer appears to have received instructions to make himself acquainted with the history and resources of the Gold Coast and the country inland as much as possible, and, considering the time and the circumstances under which he was placed, also the difficulty of acquiring information, he has handed down a work containing much valuable information to those interested in the production of gold and other minerals on the West Coast of Africa. He says: ""Guinea is a large country, extending several hundred miles, abounding with innumerable kingdoms and commonwealths. The Gold Coast, being a part of Guinea, is extended about sixty miles, beginning with the Gold River, three miles west of Assini or twelve above Axim, and ending with the village Ponni, seven or eight miles east of Accra. The negro inhabitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold, which they chiefly vend to the English and Zealand interlopers, notwithstanding the severe penalty they incur thereby, for if we catch them their so-bought goods are not only forfeited, but a heavy fine is laid upon them. Not deterred, I say, by this, they all hope to escape, to effect which they bribe our slaves (who are set as watch or spies over them) to let them pass by night, by which means we are hindered from having one hundredth part of the gold of this land; and the plain reason why the Natives run the risk of trading with the interlopers is that their goods are sometimes better than ours and always to be had one-third cheaper, whereby they are encouraged against the danger, very well knowing that a successful correspondence will soon enrich them."" Human nature on the Gold Coast and the desire to get gold—honestly if possible, but to get it—was much the same two centuries ago as now. The English, who were then termed by the Dutch as interlopers, now hold full sway over the country, but have not as yet given much encouragement to the development of the vast gold resources of the country. Accounts from the Congo show that barbarities practised on the Natives and white men by the Belgians are as bad as in the worst days of the slave trade. On my return from the Coast in 1881 I strongly advised the opening of communication with the goldfields from the convenient port of Axim by a system of light rail or tramway (narrow gauge), the trucks for goods and passengers to have been run by Natives, which would have materially assisted the more rapid development of the gold fields. Thus, commencing with a line along the coast from Axim to the mouth of the Ankobra River inside the bar, we should reach the valley of this river, an immense area of auriferous country, with well proved quartz lodes and other formations at various places. The river affords good water way, say, as far as Tomento, and sometimes much beyond. At landing stages like Tomento, leading to Tacquats and other places, the light railways should have been laid to the mining camps, for facilitating easy carriage of goods and passengers. Thus a traveller now requires six Native bearers to carry him about twelve miles a day, whereas on a light railway, as I specially designed, the passengers could be run by Native runners (in relays, say, of ten miles) 50 miles a day easily, and in much more comfort. I pointed this out to the Government authorities before this last Ashanti expedition. People do not go to the West Gold Coast of Africa to grow fruit or cereals, their chief object is gold, and it is to the profitable opening of the goldfields and establishing easy means of communications by light railways we must look to speedily and effectively bring about the increase of the supply of gold from that quarter. A system of river dredging and washing of the sand drifted up in places along the coast could be made highly profitable if properly taken in hand, but the difficulty of efficient management blocks the way. The Government must take measures to inaugurate a better system of travelling inland than by the carriage of men or goods on the heads of native bearers. Light railways, either run by steam or Native power, will be the only means of successfully developing the auriferous resources of the West Gold Coast of Africa.—Yours, &c.,', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British possessions of the Gold Coast extend over a coast line of about 350 miles, and are separated from the colony of Lagos by a short interval, which is filled up by a wedge of German, two wedges of French territory, and the narrow strip of independent Dahomie coast, which was until recently under the protection of the Portuguese. The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence. When we think of how much has been effected in the consolidation and extension of our Gold Coast territories since 1871, we may confidently hope for a further extension and a great future for this rich and important possession. The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

It is believed that the Greeks received gold from these parts 2,900 years ago. Of recent times our first African traveller, Mungo Park, proved the existence of gold north of the Kong Mountain, and described the methods by which gold was won by the Natives; a plan similar to that adopted by the Natives south of the same range. The present gold supply comes from Ashanti, and possibly the bulk of it from Wassau. A little over 40 years ago our principal supply came from the Gold Coast; but when California and Australia came to the front as gold producers, the Gold Coast was to a great extent lost sight of. Since the first supply of gold in 1471, the total amount received from West Africa has been estimated by Captain Burton at £600,000,000, an amount not in the least exaggerated, I should say, when we take into account the regular yearly returns made for a period exceeding 200 years. Other authorities estimate that in the space of 40 years no less an amount than £200,000,000 could have been received. The surface soil in some parts of the country seems to be full of gold; it has been found on the sea beach, in rivers, and even washed from the gutters of the streets of the small towns after rain. Rich mines are found in Gaman and Wassau, the principal gold fields being on the Wassau range. Expeditions have been made from time to time, and quite recently discoveries are reported from the north-west part of the Colony. Such work is slow; the country is covered with dense forest, which makes progress in travelling and surface examinations difficult. As there is traditionally great wealth in the Kong mountains, it would seem wise to construct a line of rails through the country with the object of tapping this region. We are met with the suggestion that it would be a worthless undertaking from the point of trade. This, however, is problematic. There is the conviction that gold obtains abundantly in the interior, which could be confirmed; that there is produce or a country capable of producing it is certain.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-09-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_09_1893#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD FIELDS OF WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M.

Mr. Thomas Cornish visited the Gold Coast as mining expert with Commander Cameron, and spoke well of the prospects. It is commonly thought that the richest deposits have not yet been found, and the districts we are already acquainted with, we do not know in depth. What the depth of the gold-bearing strata is no one seems to have ventured to say. The gravel beds which form the valley of the Tacquah have not been worked to any depth, and as the weight of gold is seven times greater than gravel we should naturally expect to find the richer deposits in depth, in the same way as in the well known hydraulic mines of Western America. The great drawback is the climate, which is generally admitted to be bad, although Europeans have been known to live on the coast for 20 and 30 years. Europeans often in countries like the Gold Coast indulge in excesses which undermine their health, although I cannot for one moment think that all those who have returned with broken health come under this category. Fevers, we know, prevail, and exposure to night dews is courting death. We are interested in\n\nother countries which have the reputation of unhealthiness, such as some parts of South America and India. No doubt by the exercise of the greatest precautions much sickness might be avoided, but we have still the fact that it is dangerous, and that the excessive heat is enervating. This hindrance can only be overcome by the introduction of intelligent and industrious negroes from other parts of the coast. It requires large capital to develop the resources, and it should be known that it is no country for the single-handed prospector.\n\nThere has not been any reliable record kept of the returns of the Gold Coast, nor would it have been very possible to do so, however much desired, the commercial interest having been up to within a few years ago of an indefinite character. At the beginning of the century the gold product was estimated from £300,000 to £3,000,000 annually. Of late years it has been about 25,000 ounces.

For us, of course, the reason of this neglect is not far to seek. It may be bad for a colony to belong to a very poor country; but it is sometimes almost as bad for it to belong to a very rich one, unless the inhabitants happen to be of themselves capable of working out their own advancement. The native Gold Coast people are not thus capable; and England has not hitherto realized the necessity of helping them. If she had held those countries, as she does now, a hundred years ago, and there had not then existed an accursed foreign Slave Trade, under which their inhabitants could be made profitable objects of purchase and sale, she might, perhaps, have set herself earnestly to work with the object of determining what might be made out of them.

Faced with the resistance of the Malagasy to any form of recruitment, the administration took over and, in 1926, established the Service de la Main d'Oeuvre pour les Travaux d'IntØrŒt GØnØral (SMOTIG), which required conscripts not actually called up for military service to work for three years - subsequently reduced to two years - on the colony's construction sites. The SMOTIG, which was regarded by the Malagasy as being 'slavery in disguise', was deeply resented not only by the people who were commandeered but also by 'voluntary' wage labourers who lost their jobs as a result.\nThe colonial oppression was further aggravated by the forcible takeover of land, which was then distributed to colon settlers. Under a decree promulgated in 1926, the state was declared owner of 'all vacant and ownerless land not developed, enclosed or granted by way of a concession as of the date of promulgation of the decree'.$^{24}$ Thenceforth, the good land was monopolized by the administration and the settlers encroached on the native reserves, while the Malagasy no longer had any title to owner› ship over their ancestral lands.

These different movements joined forces to recall and defend France's 'historic rights' over Madagascar. That claim, which had its roots in the memory of the annexation proclaimed under Louis XIV and of the fruitless attempts made in the eighteenth century to set up a prosperous France Orientale, based on the trading posts established in the eighteenth century and under the Restoration, was developed throughout the nineteenth century in a large number of written documents before being put to the French parliament officially in 1884. The RØunion lobby demanded the complete conquest of the island, so that the overflow of Reunion's Creole population could be settled there and the abundant resources which the British seemed likely to exploit could be reserved for their own use. French Catholic missionaries in Madagascar, for their part, were reduced to evangelizing the lower social classes since most of the noble families and the rich and powerful commoners had been converted to Protestantism. Consequently they demanded official support from France in their bid to overcome the competition of the Protestants, whom they portrayed as being a product of the innumerable 'underhand dealings' of the British. This 'perfidious Albion' theory found a favourable echo in certain business circles which, in an endeavour to conquer the Malagasy market at the expense of the British and Americans, sought to debar the latter by annexing the island rather than by reducing the prices of their own goods.

It was so vague and ambiguous that it was interpreted by both parties as each saw fit. The treaty granted France the right to 'represent Madagascar in all its foreign relations' and to maintain a resident-general with a military escort at Antananarivo. It granted French nationals the right to obtain long-term leases of up to ninety-nine years and the French navy the right to occupy Diego Suarez, while the French government was awarded an indemnity of ten million francs. This treaty, in which there is no mention of the word 'protectorate', recognized Queen Ranavalona as sovereign of the entire island and as sole owner of land. The 'Appendix' or explanatory letter which the prime minister demanded and secured from the French negotiators on 9 January 1886, before agreeing to ratify the treaty, laid down the powers of the resident-general, fixed the size of his military escort at fifty men, and described the limits of the territory of Diego Suarez as being one nautical mile to the south and west and four miles to the north. These terms were meant to limit the scope of the treaty. The French administration, on the other hand, attached no significance to the 'Appendix' and interpreted the agreement concluded on 17 December 1885 as being a protectorate treaty. By contrast, the Malagasy government, which was dominated by Rainilaiarivony, refused to consider the document as a treaty establishing a protectorate over the island and put forward a quite different interpretation of the document, in opposition to the French schemes. This interpretation was based on constant references to the 'Appendix', which had limited the scope of the clauses that were regarded as being prejudicial to the independence of the kingdom. The rulers in Antananarivo accordingly attempted to prevent the protectorate from coming into being by playing on the differences between the French and the Malagasy texts and the clarifications spelt out in the additional protocol. 10 Thus, a war of attrition came to be waged between the prime minister and successive residents-general as misunderstandings continued to multiply.

The Malagasy had developed the planting of rice to such a high degree of specialization that one observer remarked 'that in few things is the industry and ingenuity of the Malagasy shown more than in the cultivation of rice.'64 Besides agriculture, the economy of Madagascar depended on the rearing of cattle, particularly among the Sakalava in the west and the people in the south of the island.

Notwithstanding this arrangement, and despite the fact that Madagascar with all its rich resources lies close at hand, France has still to grant 62,000 dols. a year, and tax every inhabitant to the amount of five dols. a head, before the colony can be kept up; simply because there are no colonists there, but merely worrying officials. Yet in the face of these facts, the Republic wishes to enlarge her possessions in Madagascar. The prospects of the island as a French colony, judging from the doings in Tamatave during the past year, are far from encouraging. Already a protection duty has been put on American imports, and trade has been driven to other parts of the island. With such facts as these to guide them, Mauritian colonists ought to be able to foresee the effects of a French possession. Take for instance the innumerable list of towns all down the East Coast. As a rule, we may state that they have been colonized on an average by twenty-five Mauritians and five French citizens of Réunion to each village. Now these five Bourbonnais would be just enough to satisfy the wants of each place. Instead of hawking round red cotton pocket-handkerchiefs, absinthe, and Marseilles pottery, they would immediately be installed as ""Monsieur le Maire,"" ""Monsieur le Chef de Douane,"" ""Monsieur le Juge,"" and the remaining ones could be made secretaries and chancellors. They close their shops, put some gold lace round their hats, post up a set of painted boards announcing the ""Departement de ceci,"" and ""Departement de cela;"" and then strut about underneath the cocoa-nut trees, take their vermouth at decent intervals, wear a ribbon of the Legion of Honour in their button-holes, and talk loudly about the success of French colonization. Certainly for them there are great benefits, but where are the American merchants? Where are the Mauritians? The twenty-five Mauritians in each village will have to pay taxes sufficient to support their five Bourbonnais officials, whereas formerly these Bourbonnais were very glad to get a few hundred dollars\' credit from some English merchant to go and trade up the river. The imports from France will naturally always include wines and spirits which will enter free of duty to these sinecure officials, and the Mauritians will probably have to pay for a bottle of claret about three shillings to a dollar, while Mauritius rum, which certainly cannot be called nectar, will probably cost more than French brandy imported from Bordeaux.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND MADAGASCAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Malagasy Government has lately published the official correspondence between its Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Consuls of France. A more shameful story of arrogance and high-handed wrong-doing on the part of a first-rate European Power has been seldom given to the world. The first dispute, it seems, arose over the sale of land by the heirs of a former French Consul to a Roman Catholic priest. The Hova Government objected to the sale because the Consul in question, by Malagasy law, which prohibits the owning of land by foreigners, was only a life tenant. Moreover, the title-deeds which the Hova Government declare to have been forged, bore the signature of King Radama II., dated several months after that monarch\'s death. The French Consul attempted to explain this unpleasant fact away by different reckonings of the calendar, but the Hovas are able to prove that not a single document of Radama II.\'s reign bears the date of 1864 except the particular one in dispute. The second dispute arose over the death of four French sailors on the coast. These men were, from the Malagasy standpoint, nothing more nor less than smugglers, who were landing weapons of war and ammunition, contrary to treaty. A Malagasy chief endeavoured to stop this traffic, and was fired upon by the French smugglers, whereupon the fire was returned, with the result that four of the French were killed and the goods in question seized. In the end the Hova Government paid an indemnity under protest. The trumped-up claim of the French to a Protectorate over the North-west Coast rests upon an alleged transfer of power by a certain chief to the French; but, apart from the fact that this man, as a vassal, had no right to alienate lands, the treaty which he did sign only allowed the French to settle for agricultural and commercial purposes, and to keep some armed men ""for their own protection."" We regret to find that the tone of the French officials throughout the controversy is to the last degree insolent and provocative. They appear to have acted upon the principle that weak nations have no rights which France is bound to respect; and that every Frenchman who finds himself in the territory of such a nation has a right to whatever he pleases, no matter what may be the law of the country. It is this kind of treatment of other nations which has more than once drawn down upon France evils and troubles which have shaken the whole commonwealth to its very centre.

The testimony on this subject is so strong as to be absolutely conclusive. The facts, indeed, are not denied by the French Government, who will probably contend that what the planters require is simply the organization of free African labour on the indentureship system. Experience in Réunion has shown that it is impossible to secure adequate protection to imported labourers, even when the British Government, acting diplomatically as well as through its resident agents, did its best to induce the local authorities to see that justice was done. But even if the Administration in Réunion could be trusted, it would be impossible so to control the so-called immigration from Africa as to prevent it from becoming a branch of the slave-trade. Africa does not suffer from pressure of population, and there is no natural desire on the part of the people to emigrate to distant countries. At the same time, if the French determine to introduce African engagés into Réunion, the supply of labourers is certain to be equal to the demand, but this will only be by the unscrupulous action of slave-traders eager for a new and profitable market. It is said that large numbers of Sakalavas have been taken to Réunion from the North-west coast of Madagascar, but that, although a good deal has been said as to the voluntary nature of the contracts and the limited period during which the engaged labourers were to be absent from their homes, not one of them has ever been known to return. There is reason to believe that the recent proceedings of the French in Madagascar are attributable not so much to a restless spirit of aggression on the part of the French Government as to the intrigues of colonial planters, who think that under cover of the national flag they may draw a perennial supply of servile labour from the western coast of the great African island. It is satisfactory to learn that the attention of the anti-slavery party in France is being directed to this subject, and that they have resolved strenuously to oppose the revival of a system which, if sanctioned by the Government, cannot fail to bring discredit upon the Republic."" We have thought it right to call attention to this matter because some of our friends thought we should be justified, by late severe indisposition, in discontinuing the publication of The African Times.

That Great Britain had never yielded to the temptation to take possession of that magnificent island when there were none to oppose her in so doing, was a reason why France should not attempt to disturb existing international understandings with regard to it and other independent native African territories. But now a thirst for colonial aggrandisement has clearly taken possession of the French official mind. The Republic must have its glories somewhere. Where? Let her get them on the side of Tonquin, and of Africa. And we do not see that Great Britain can justly take exception to this. She has had her day of conquests and annexations, and why should it follow that because she is sated and ""cares"" now ""for none of these things,"" therefore no such aspirations as those in which she formerly indulged shall be cherished by France or any other European nation? If to conquer and colonize be a sin on the part of France, it is certainly not Britain that should cast the first stone. We may be grieved; there has been a feeling of great interest created in England on behalf of Madagascar, where it has been believed that something like an enlightened and Christian native Government had been established; and there will also be some serious injury sustained by some portion of Her Majesty\'s colonial possessions by Madagascar being shut up against the rest of the world by the jealous French colonial rule and regulations as regards trade. But this cannot be avoided if the French do take possession. Earl Granville has, we are convinced, done all that could possibly be done on behalf of the Madagascar people and Government; but as we have not any territorial rights in Madagascar, having always refrained from acquiring any, so that we might not tempt others to go in also, it seems to us that we cannot do anything but acquiesce should Madagascar be made a French colonial possession. We may nationally as well as individually sympathize and feel deeply, and we do sympathize and feel deeply; but there is a wide gulf between this and going to war with the object of maintaining the independence of Madagascar. If France fancies she has need of the island, and believes that she has a pretext that justifies her in her own eyes in taking possession of it, we do not see how she can be prevented having it. And any armed resistance on the part of the Hovas should be deprecated rather than encouraged by any portion of the British Press or people, because it is absurd to suppose that a nation like France, once embarked on the enterprise of subjugating Madagascar, would desist until she had fully effected her object. In our view, however, there is more than the subjugation of Madagascar at issue in this matter. It is the demand there will be, on the part of French planters and colonists, for negro labour that fills us with apprehension that there will be a great renewal of the foreign slave-trade from East Africa, under the name, perhaps, of free apprenticeships, but in reality bondage, with all its cruelties. This action, moreover, on the part of France may open a new era of European enterprise (not British) to take possession of what are looked upon as, and for the most part are, the hitherto unannexed uncivilized portions of the earth. We have not always agreed with the modern determination of Great Britain against annexing territories the inhabitants of which are uncivilized, and who would fall a ready prey to adventurers from other European countries. Not because we have any land greed, but because, with all its faults, British Crown government has done more than would have been done by any other government for the spread of civilization, while energetic British Missionary Societies never fail to send the message of the Gospel of peace and salvation to peoples thus taken under British rule. There will be trouble on the West Coast of Africa some day through our not having established British rule over the so-called Oil River territories.

The French planters of a neighbouring island covet Madagascar, and from an impulse given by them, the French Government has commenced operations which have every probability of being continued until Madagascar becomes a French colonial possession. The various items of intelligence which we publish in other columns, giving brief accounts of the preliminary operations of the French Naval Commander, suffice to justify the belief that the French Government have decided on the conquest of Madagascar. That in this they should have departed from certain arrangements long since made by it with that of Great Britain, will not, we think, save Madagascar from annexation to the colonial possessions of France. And what an addition to those possessions, if acquired! An island 1,000 miles in length, by an average breadth of 240 miles, and containing 240,000 square miles of surface. It must be owned that ""the game is worth the candle,"" if there be a possibility of acquiring this rich territorial gem of the Indian Ocean. And, possibly, there undoubtedly is, if Madagascar be left, as it most probably will be left, to defend itself. To the planters of Réunion, from which it is distant only 150 miles, it is a tempting acquisition; not the less tempting that it is also only 100 miles from Mozambique, on the East coast of Africa, so long notorious for the African foreign slave-trade carried on there. For, as we stated when the French claims upon Madagascar were first put forward, it would be absurd to attempt to shut our eyes to the fact that there was an intimate connection between the prohibition by the British Indian Government of any further supply of coolie labour to Réunion, and the putting forward of those claims. What those planters desire is evidently a supply of labourers whom they may ""use up"" at pleasure in the old Cuban fashion. If they would have given decent, humane treatment to the Indian coolies, there was in our East Indian possessions an inexhaustible field of supply. But the British Government which exacts from the planters in its own island, the Mauritius, guarantees for the good treatment and freedom of their coolie labourers—guarantees which were for a long time very unpalatable to them—could not possibly permit the continued subjection of any portion of its Indian subjects to the barbarities of Réunion. Seeing, then, the primary object with which the war by France upon Madagascar has been undertaken, we are compelled to classify it as an iniquitous war—a war fraught with evils of no slight nature, both to the natives of Madagascar itself and to the East coast and Eastern countries of Africa, where we may expect to see a considerable increase of that infamous, inhuman, devastating slave-traffic, the denunciation and exposure of which by the lamented Dr. Livingstone are familiar to our readers. Yes; in its inception this French war on Madagascar is a war for the extension of a negro slave-trade, and, therefore, unworthy of the French Republic. We say, in its inception; because there can be no doubt that the French Government and people will indignantly deny that they are actuated by any such motive. And we believe them. The Réunion wire-pullers have kept their machinery out of sight, merely bringing forward supposed French claims upon a portion of the Island, which their agents no doubt represented to the French Government would, after a little difficulty on the part of the Hovas Government, be admitted, if properly pressed; well knowing that when a Government such as that of France puts forth claims, whether just or unjust, with an expressed determination to enforce them, there can be but one result where the antagonist is a weak and only partially semi-civilized state. And this ""urging"" on the part of the Réunion interests has, unhappily for Madagascar, happened at a time when an idea of greatly extending its colonial dominions had taken possession of the French mind. The dominance of that idea is manifest by the determination to annex Tonquin and Annam; in its approval of, and subvention to, the De Brazza Congo territory expedition; in its resumed protectorate over Porto Novo, for which the old Régis influence seems to have been at work. Now, like all our brethren of the British daily press, we have no objection to a great extension of French colonial dominion, provided the efforts to accomplish it do not strike at the roots of objects, convictions, and interests of international importance and of long-pursued efforts for the spread of civilization and the removal of sanguinary barbarisms. But this war upon Madagascar does strike at the root of convictions and objects very dear to the people of Great Britain, and recognized as just and holy by all civilized Governments, having acquired thereby a general international sanction. France cannot succeed in that war without giving a renewed impetus to a traffic in negro slaves. We have said that probably she will succeed in subjugating the Island if she persist, although the history of European attempts upon portions of it points to difficulties of a very serious nature. We are putting altogether out of question any supposition that the British Government will put forward claims founded upon the proclamation of sovereignty over the Island by Sir Robert Farquhar in 1816, which have been virtually in abeyance, at least, by the acknowledgment of and support given to successive Hovas sovereigns. But let us suppose that no such European intervention stands between France and her projected conquest. Here is a tropical island, 1,000 miles long by 240 wide, with a population estimated at 5,000,000, all speaking the same language, though with great difference of origin and physical and mental characteristics. The question first resolves itself into this: Are these people jealous of, and will they struggle heartily and persistently against foreign domination? Nothing is to be inferred by way of response to this from the facility with which the French Naval Commander has shelled certain forts or establishments on the coast. The people were not prepared for such an event. Reliance was no doubt placed, in some measure, on what might be effected by the Envoys in Europe, and a declaration of war might possibly have been looked for as a preliminary. Here is an island with 2,500 miles of coast. Effectively to blockade this would not be an easy matter. We have already heard of arms of precision being purchased in England for expedition to Madagascar; and since there is a strong feeling in the United States in favour of the\n**79**', 'last_edit_date': '1883-07-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1883#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR, AND THE SLAVE-TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Purposes are being disclosed, and events following the course we had anticipated. From the very outset of the French demands on the Hovas Government we foresaw and stated in this journal our belief that the acquisition of the whole Island would be found to be the aim and purpose of the French Government—that the French Government had been instigated to this by the Planter interest of Réunion—that these not only desired the sugar-lands of Madagascar, but facilities for obtaining labourers now that the supply of coolies from India was cut off—and that the result would be a speedy increase of activity in the East African foreign slave-trade. We at the same time stated our conviction that the Hovas Government and people would offer a strenuous and persistent opposition to the French demands, rendering it necessary for France to employ considerable naval and land forces. Events have not been slow in proving the correctness of our opinion. Late information, of which we give the substance in another column, states that on the occasion of the coronation of the new Queen at Antananarivo on the 22nd of November last, a solemn declaration was made by the Sovereign and her Prime Minister that not an inch of Malagasy territory would be surrendered to the French. Only a few days before the reception of this news in Paris there had been articles in influential Paris journals, believed to be inspired by the French Government authorities, to the effect that no treaty of any kind with the Hovas for rights over a portion of the Island was to be thought of—that the Hovas Government was one that would not respect any such treaty even if made, and, therefore, that nothing ought to or would satisfy France short of a protectorate by the latter over the entire island. The French Government have, no doubt, been feeling the pulse of all the European Governments, and that of the United States of America; and having arrived at the full conviction that not one of them would resist the subjugation of Madagascar by force of arms, have thought the time for concealment of their ultimate views and purposes might now be put an end to, and their determination be revealed by semi-official press statements. Now, although this could not cause us any surprise, because we had so fully foreseen it, it has not the less grieved us. The seed that has been thus sown must produce a great crop of evils. If the Hovas be such as we have always understood them to be, the French will not obtain possession of the Island save through a war of extermination; and this means an amount of human suffering the possibility of which one cannot think of without deep pain. For it must be borne in mind that although neither Great Britain nor the United States would feel justified in breaking the international peace that now happily exists, with the object of preserving the independence of Madagascar, although Great Britain has some large interests involved as regards the necessary supplies for Mauritius, hitherto obtained freely under arrangement with the Hovas Government, yet the cause of the people of Madagascar has strongly aroused the sympathies of large and influential sections of the British and United States' people, many of whom will..."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Situation in Madagascar', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The consequence is that the Madagascar war has been brought on by the hungry rabble; and where do we see a single capitalist or merchant who will stand up for the Malagasy?

Mauritius and Bourbon count ten newspapers which feed the French papers—i.e., about ten millions of readers hear nothing but bad reports about the Hovas. Even the *Merchants\' and Planters\' Gazette* of Mauritius, in its number for May 20, 1884, believes that it is telling the truth when it represents the English and Americans as ""gaining concessions of land which are relentlessly refused to France."" People seem to confound altogether a ""concession"" and a ""lease,"" but the French people do not; and however much Governments pretend not to be influenced by the public press, it is very certain that all these false reports are only provoking jealousy and fanning the flame of war. When the Malagasy Ambassadors went to Europe, even their presence and influence could not withstand the current of false opinions about the Hova people. Then followed the Malagasy official *Gazette*, which now keeps us informed of the truth, but which is hated like a viper because it does publish the truth. The false structure built up by unprincipled agitators is beginning to totter. The idea of impoverishing the Hovas is absurd. Imerina is rich in cattle, its agricultural resources are unbounded; iron, copper, and lead are plentiful for making arms. Cotton is plentiful for weaving. Imerina could supply the London market with eggs and poultry without any appreciable diminution, and as long as the French leave a single creek open, they might just as well...\n\nas well give up blockading altogether, as far as the Hovas are concerned. Wherever the French settle, even if they succeeded in settling anywhere, the natives would desert them, and they would have to import even rice, or plant it themselves. For every agriculturist who settles, they will require two soldiers to guard him, and a doctor to attend him in the fever. The natives will always prefer to work for the English and Americans, who are friendly with the Hovas, for the same wages, and no fear of punishment, than to work for the French under penalty of having their heads cut off. The Hovas have the most powerful weapon against the French as long as they hold Imerina; they have simply to call in foreign capital to start iron works, lead works, sheep-farming on the healthy hills of the interior, and leave the fever-stricken French Creoles with a gun in one hand and a spade in the other to linger out a jeopardised existence.

Leases and contracts with workpeople will be certified in due form before the French Resident and the magistrates of the country; and the strict execution of the provisions of such instruments will be guaranteed by the Government. At the death of a Frenchman who may have been the tenant of any landed or house property, his heirs will have the benefit of the remaining term of the lease concluded by the deceased, with the power of renewing the same. Frenchmen will only be called upon for the land tax paid by the Malagasies. No person shall have access to the property, or enter the establishments or houses occupied by Frenchmen, or by any person in their service, except with the sanction of the French Resident. 7. The Queen expressly confirms guarantees stipulated by the Treaty of August 7, 1885; in favour of liberty of conscience and religious toleration. 8. The Queen's Government undertakes to pay the sum of 10,000,000 francs, to be applied in the settlement of French claims liquidated before the last war and in compensation for the damages suffered by foreign subjects by reason of that war. The investigation and settlement of the indemnities is left to the French Government. 9. Until payment in full of the above-mentioned sum French troops will occupy Tamatave. 10. No claim will be admitted in connexion with the measures taken up to the present by the French military authorities. 11. The Government of the French Republic undertakes to lend assistance to the Queen for the defence of her States. 12. The Queen will continue as heretofore to preside over the internal administration of the whole island. 13. In consideration of these engagements, the French Republic agrees to desist from any renewal of its demand for a war indemnity. 14. The Government of the French Republic, in order to aid the advance of the Malagasy Government and people on the path of civilization and progress, undertakes to place at the Queen's disposal the military instructors, engineers, professors, and artisan foremen whose services may be applied for. 15. The Queen expressly undertakes to treat with goodwill the Sakalaves and Antankares agreeably to the information on this subject furnished by the French Government. The Government of the Republic reserves to itself the right of occupying the Bay of Diego Suarez, and of creating there the establishments that it may consider desirable. 16. The President of the French Republic and the Queen grant a general and complete amnesty, accompanied by the raising of all sequestrations placed upon property, to their respective subjects who, prior to the conclusion of peace, compromised themselves by serving the other contracting party. 17. The actually existing treaties and conventions between the French Republic and the Queen are expressly confirmed, in so far as they may not be contrary to stipulations of the present treaty. 18. The present treaty has been drawn up in French and Malagasy, the two versions having exactly the same sense, so that the two texts may be legally cited in every respect. 19. The present treaty shall be ratified within a period of three months."", 'last_edit_date': '1886-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1886#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR. THE COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Commercially and industrially speaking, the coast of Madagascar may be divided into five great divisions. The first is the long stretch of east coast from Antongil Bay to Fort Dauphin, forming almost a straight line. It contains not a single really good natural harbour, nor a decently navigable river of any length, and most of its towns are only approached by dangerous roadsteads. From its geographical position it will easily be understood that its foreign element are mostly Mauritians. The natural resources of this coast have been to a great extent exhausted, and the prospects now lie principally in sugar-planting. The Mauritians are naturally acquainted with this industry, and there is a great future before them. Coffee is also a profitable undertaking, but it must not be planted at a lower elevation than 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. Spices of almost every kind can also be cultivated auxiliary to the sugar plantations. The second division is that called the North-east Coast, being that part between Antongil Bay and Cape Amber. It contains two or three harbours, but not very good ones. The forests here are much larger than in any other part, and consequently the natural supplies of India-rubber and gum-copal are still plentiful. This is the most thinly populated part of the island, but exceedingly fertile. Probably in a few more years the natural resources will be exhausted, and foreign residents will then have recourse to agriculture, with better results perhaps than can be obtained on any other part of the East Coast. The third division of the Coast is the North-west, from Cape Amber to Cape St. Andrew, and the part coveted by France. This part contains lignite deposits and valuable woods, and is full of good harbours. Its foreign element consists chiefly of Indians and Muslims, and a few French Creoles. The fourth division is the West Coast, properly called—i.e., from Cape St. Andrew North to St. Augustine South. Full of good harbours and navigable rivers, it is probably the finest part of Madagascar. The foreigners there are mostly Americans and Englishmen, who carry on a trade with the Cape and Natal. The fifth part is the Southern portion, from St. Augustine to Fort Dauphin, about which nothing is really known.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how little is yet known of the vast commercial resources of this island, and of the number of industries that may be opened. The trade of the last few months has been characterised by a little more activity, but at best can only be said to be very slack. The coast merchants are still prevented from exporting such articles as would afford supplies to the French armies, or were prevented up to a very short time ago. The wholesale trade in hides at Antananarivo has somewhat revived, but is far from satisfactory. Cottons are still high, and the American merchants are doing nothing.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-04-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SUGAR PRODUCTION IN MADAGASCAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But it is upon sugar that those who believe in a great commercial future for Madagascar pin their faith.

But two English and two Creole firms of Mauritius have, meanwhile, discovered in sugar a source of wealth which if properly tapped will draw from the soil of Madagascar a stream of gold that in value may rival the richest mines of the earth. Bullocks and coffee are articles the export of which to Europe may be calculated upon to grow in due time. With them, however, a beginning has yet to be made, and pioneers willing to undertake the risk of experiment have to be found. But as regards the profitable production of sugar, the experimental stage has already been passed. That there is ""money in it,"" and lots of money, has been conclusively proved, and only a few obsolete and impracticable Hova laws have to be removed, and Madagascar may be expected to develop rapidly into the chief sugar-producing country of the world. Four years ago the first real attempt at establishing a sugar plantation in the neighbourhood of Tamatave was made; and already dividends of fifteen to twenty per cent. on the capital invested are being realized. Next year one estate, which is becoming the property of a joint-stock company, promises to pay thirty per cent., and the limit of remuneration has by no means been reached. Last year these four pioneer estates, aggregating one thousand acres, exported five hundred tons of sugar. The season just closing will yield a total of one thousand tons, and next season is expected to produce double that quantity. These figures and these results merit the attention of British capitalists, who in Madagascar may find a new, a safe, and a profitable field for their enterprise. A few notes made during a visit paid yesterday to one of these estates may prove interesting. Starting from Tamatave in the early morning, we were rapidly carried on the shoulders of our porters over eight miles of the beautiful green sward which all along the eastern coast of Madagascar reaches close down to the sea. Here we reached the mouth of one of the numerous rivers that, emerging from the uplands, meander placidly through the belt of low-lying coast country, and embarked on board a canoe. The estate lay ten miles up the river, and over that distance we were paddled and poled in an hour and a half. Soon after leaving the vicinity of the sea we found ourselves in that rich country of which I had heard so much in Mauritius. The banks on either hand were edged by long lines of the most gorgeous vegetation. To detail the different trees and plants would be to run over half the list of the tropical vegetable world. Palms of all the different species, magnificent groves of mango trees, wild cardamoms, and the coffee, indigo, and bread-fruit plants, were to be seen, while the long, slender and graceful bamboo toned down with its shade of delicate green the more flaunting colours of the robust growths.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-04-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_04_1883#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'French Colonization in Madagascar', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'One of the most important, in a certain sense, of the French settlements in Madagascar, is the small island of Mayotte, which, discovered by the Portuguese in 1598, remained independent until 1841, when it was taken possession of on behalf of the French by Captain Passot.

The islands are high and mountainous, partly volcanic, and with coasts of coral formation; and they are distinguished for the fertility of their soil and a climate made temperate by sea breezes. The vegetation has a tropical character, but includes excellent timber for ship-building. Rice and maize grow there, and yams, bananas, and mangos, as well as oranges, lemons, cotton, wild indigo, and the sugar-cane. An important feature is the abundance of tortoises. Large numbers of cattle and sheep are also produced in the islands. The natives are a mixed race of East African Swahili negroes, Arabs, and Malays, professedly Mahometans, but largely given up to fetish worship.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': 'The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals. With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers. The family was the basic unit of production. It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

As J. L. Vellut has emphasized, the nineteenth century was not just 'the history of the ebb and flow of the world economy as experienced by ... Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'. He fed, clothed and met social obligations of members; he determined the size of land and the type of crops to be cultivated each year; how much time to spend on the collective household farm (gandu; plur., gandaye), and how much on"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': 'African resistance helped substantially to dictate a slow pace of economic colonization for at least the three decades between 1880 and 1910. Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

But, in the nineteenth century, the accumulation of captives by certain privileged groups often coincided with the rapid growth ofa marketrelated sector of the economy rather than with economic expansion due to increased payments of tribute-money. We have seen the result in the role played by 'domestic slaves' in the demographic and agricultural expansion of some of the communities in the region, such as the Kongo, Ovimbundu, and Ovambo.\nIn Angolan colonial society, the slave trade was likewise linked to the capitalist market economy, and had grown to sizeable proportions by the second half of the nineteenth century.

In Kenya, by 1927, between 83700 and 117 000 Africans, or more than 50% of total wage labour, worked in commercial agriculture. The leading crops were maize, coffee, wheat and sisal.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee.

These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy.

The king was the 'rainmaker' and also responsible for sharing out the land and organizing river damming and other irrigation works. 13 As a result of such development, we can say that the long-standing disparities in population distribution were probably accentuated in the nineteenth century.

Some economic factors encouraged the practice of gathering, such as the collection of ivory and wax by the Chokwe and this promoted the dispersion of people in the forest.

In 1862 the imports amounted to £77,932, and the exports to £61,933; last year (1891) the imports were £607,718, and the exports £716,642. Lagos trade is subject to fluctuations, among other reasons, owing to the eccentric conduct of the middlemen from the interior, whose arbitrary demands and exactions have from time to time blocked the routes upon which the trade of the Colony depends.**\n\n""It is evident that in a trade which has its foundation on the barter system the value and quantity of the imports must vary directly with the exports. There is of late years a growing tendency on the part of the native, even in the remote interior, to employ silver currency for his transactions in place of direct barter or the cumbrous method of transporting vast quantities of cowrie shells from market to market. Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods. The attention of the natives has been directed lately to the importance of developing minor industries. Among these may be mentioned the cultivation of cocoa and coffee, which has been taken up both by the natives and, in one\n\nFor instance, on a large scale, by European enterprise. Even more importance is now attached to cotton, which is cultivated in large quantities in the interior of Yoruba for home manufacture. During the current year one of the obstructing tribes who prevented direct communication with the ""hinterland"" has been forced to open its roads, and it is to be hoped that the shipments of cotton, which amounted to 379,300lb., of a value at the port of shipment of £4,825 6s. 10d., during the past year, will in 1893 be very largely increased.

In doing this, one such impediment stands out in strong relief; while, in consequence of the rapid change now taking place in the mode of conducting the business of this country with West Africa, we feel convinced that it is only necessary we should throw a strong and just light upon it to lead to its speedy removal. This impediment is the rate of freight on cotton from West African countries to England. At the first glance it may be thought by the owners of steam and sailing ships trading with Africa that we are premature in mooting the subject of a reduction in the rates of freight on cotton. It may be urged by them that these rates have undergone a reduction of 50 per cent., and their first impulse will no doubt be to say that it is preposterous to expect they can be still further reduced. It is true, thanks to the British and African Steam Navigation Company, that the rate of freight on cotton is now 3d. per pound instead of 1¼d. per pound, as it was in the days of steam monopoly by the African Steamship Company; but, at the same time, it is equally true that the rate of 3d. per pound is still too high a rate for the products of an industry that needs to be nursed and encouraged, and is consequently an impediment to that increase in the growth of cotton in West Africa which is so desirable for the progress of the African countries and the interests of Great Britain. Only those who, thirsting for African advancement, were watching the onward march of African agricultural industry, were sensible of the great impediment to the cotton culture which 1¼d. per pound freight on cotton to England placed in its way. It was a grievous error of the African Steamship Company to impose such a freight on cotton. The earliest efforts made in cotton culture for exportation, under the munificent donation of Miss Burdett Coutts so ably applied by Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester, had established that cotton might be made in the course of time to figure largely in the exports of West Africa; that soil and climate favoured its growth, and that the natives in certain districts were willing to cultivate it for foreign markets. But 1¼d. per pound freight to Liverpool was a frightful obstacle, and the rate of progress was very slow until the disastrous civil war in America raised the price of New Orleans cotton from 5d. to above 2s. per pound. The African cotton from the Egba Countries is not much inferior to the New Orleans; it therefore approximated in value to the latter in the British markets, and the high price gave a stimulus to the African cotton industry which enabled it to triumph over the 1¼d. obstacle. Prices receded after the termination of the American war, but until lately they have been such as still to allow the production in Africa to progress, notwithstanding the 1¼d. and, later, as at present, 3d. freight. But the joint influence, temporarily of the European war, and, we believe permanently, of increased production in the United States, with the opening of new facilities of supply from India to England, via the Suez Canal, has caused a rapid fall in prices during the last few months, a fall which seems to point unmistakeably to prices somewhat similar to those which ruled immediately before the American struggle. We do not hesitate to say that this change of circumstance necessitates a change of rate of freight on cotton from Africa to England—necessitates it both in the interests of Africa and of the steam companies themselves. We are convinced that in what we are about to ask we are consulting their best interests. The interests of conveyers of produce from the Coast cannot be dissociated from those of the producers and traders. The African Steam Company did not see this heretofore; monopoly often creates blindness; but better counsels now prevail, a clearer sight has now been given, and we expect to see the now friendly rivals, the two great Steamship Companies, carefully watching the rise of any new agricultural industry in the African countries, and fostering and giving impetus to it by low rates of freight for the new product in the infancy of production. There are only three of the West African exports that depend entirely on what may be strictly called agricultural industry. These are ground-nuts, ginger, and cotton. The first of these has already established itself as a great staple, and may therefore be placed, more or less, although it has now a growing competition with the East Indies and other countries, in the same category with the grand staple, palm-oil, which may be left to take care of itself without any fear of prejudice thereby resulting to it. But cotton requires, demands, the nursing care of the shipowners. It has not, like palm-oil, a monopoly in European markets; it has to struggle against the organised production in America, the East Indies, Egypt, and other countries where a large capital and great facilities of transit, together with all the economising appliances which large capital only can command, give it great advantages. Under these circumstances it is to the interest, as we have before said, of this country, of the steam companies, and of Africa, that it should be treated with exceptional tenderness. And as the African advocate and guardian we earnestly ask this of them. We want to see this cotton industry so important to Great Britain, greatly and rapidly developed in the Egba, Yoruba, and Volta Countries. The latter, whenever a permanent pacification takes place, by the country becoming secured against Ashantee inroads, may be made a large cotton producer. Mr. J. C. Brandt, and one or two other Accra men, gave the first impulse, we believe, in Krepee, during the American war, and the German missionary traders followed profitably in the same path. The Ashantee invasion has for a time greatly impaired this industry, but there is every reason why, with so industrious a people as the Krepees, and good soil and climate, there should be a large exportation via the River Volta from Krepee, if the Steam Companies act on our suggestion. And we are not asking them to make any great present sacrifice to their own future and Africa's permanent interests. We are not going to ask them to bring cotton from Lagos or the Volta or Accra, to Liverpool, at freights lower than the average paid for cotton of other countries to that port. American cotton pays 7-16ths per pound freight by steamers from New York, or 3-16ths per pound by fast-sailing ships; African, even at the now reduced rates, pays 3d. per pound freight equally by the steamships and by those, for the most part, tubs of sailing ships, which manage to take three or four months, at best, to make the voyage. We are only asking them to do what is just and reasonable, and what will be to their own advantage in the long run."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-10-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Cotton Growing in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the course of a letter appearing in a recent issue of the *Manchester Examiner & Times*, the writer throws out a very valuable suggestion: ""That, in the interests of the native races of Africa (and of Lancashire), something might be done by other methods than the selfishness displayed in the scramble for African territory.

Although cotton grows wild in the colony it is almost neglected, except in the Volta district, where Messrs. F. & A. Swanzy have plantations. The quantity exported is extremely small. This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture. The enormous number of silk-cotton trees in the colony would yield a plentiful supply if the people found it worth collecting and exporting, and the timber is used for making fishing canoes.\n\nRice also might be made an important crop on the Gold Coast. It is grown in the Axim and Quittah districts. In the former district a red variety is grown in the marshy plains. It is large, soft-grained, and sweet, resembling the Sierra Leone rice. In the Quittah district an upland sort is grown, and forms the staple food of the inhabitants. These two districts are capable of supplying the requirements of the whole colony, and other districts are adapted to the growth of this crop, in which a large and profitable foreign trade might be carried on, yet the colony imports largely, as will be seen by the following statement:', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.749, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Palm Oil and Cotton', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It becomes clear, therefore, that, in order to obtain the same quantity of cotton goods that they formerly received, and now really want, the African must produce some other commodity with which to purchase them. Cotton being indigenous, and the high price of cotton in this country being the cause of half their deficiency of return for their palm oil, there is strong inducement for them to set earnestly about its cultivation. We hope that the British merchants trading to Africa will demand cotton everywhere; that when the natives complain of insufficient return for their oil, the merchants will say, ""Bring us cotton."" It is their duty, and it will be for their interest, to do this. And if this be constantly done, the result cannot fail to be a great increase of cotton production in Africa. The British merchants trading to Africa must turn their attention seriously to cotton, for the decrease in value of tallow proceeds from causes not temporary, but, to all appearance, permanent. And in this strange combination of fluctuations in trade we find the germ of African industrial regeneration. It is just such a combination as was indispensable to overcome the industrial stagnation in Africa—to give a sufficient motive for an increased degree of labour—to raise up a rival to the too facile palm tree in the African mind.\n\n**COTTON!

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

That they are instruments in the world's advancement, is undeniable. We alluded last month to the impulse given to the search for available fibre, consequent upon the failure of the cotton supply from America, and of the influence fibre might exercise in the great work of African industrial regeneration. It is scarcely necessary to say here that we believe in that regeneration. And feeble as the evidences of its approach may seem to the world at large, we think we see in them a strength that nothing can long impede or overcome. Yes, Africa must emerge from her Pagan superstition, her wars and atrocities, her industrial apathy and inertia. Looking at her in relation with the rest of the world some ten years since, the prospect was gloomy enough; the day of her emerging seemed indefinitely postponed. This was only because we could not see what was in the womb of time. Those ten years, a brief space in the world's history, have been mighty in the agencies which they have organised for African advancement. The inscrutable mind and Almighty hand of Divine Providence have been at work among the nations for the good of Africa!

Palm oil has become the great staple of Western Africa. Taking into account the difficulty of access to the interior, and the manners and habits of the people, it must be admitted that the trade in this useful article has had an extraordinary development. Palm oil was precisely such an article as the barbarous inhabitants of a tropical climate needed to possess in the infancy of their commerce. The tree which produces the palm-oil nut is the most valuable of all trees to the native African. It grows spontaneously over large tracts of country. It furnishes him with oil, wine, vinegar, thatch, fibre, and fuel. Accustomed themselves to the free use of palm oil, the Africans had only to prepare a larger quantity from fruit ready to their hands, for which they had neither to till or sow."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COTTON IN AND FROM EGYPT', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is but natural that this portion of Africa, which enjoyed a high degree of heathen civilization long before the Christian era commenced, should have taken the lead in the supply of that great agent in civilization—cotton.

Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom.

The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AMERICAN COTTON CROP OF 1870-1 AND EXPECTED CROP OF 1871-2', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""For the cotton year that closed on August 31, I forwarded in my last letter a brief item giving the New York Cotton Exchange report of the receipts of cotton at the shipping ports, which aggregated 3,988,577 bales. The New York Financial and Commercial Chronicle, whose returns include an additional day, September 1, gives the receipts at 4,009,502 bales, which is an increase of 1,101,593 bales over the aggregate receipts of the preceding year. The difference in the two statements is about 21,000 bales. These returns refer to the actual receipts at the shipping ports. The Charleston Courier of September 1, in its annual review of the cotton year just closed, speaks of its aggregate product as not far from 4,250,000 bales. The crop was next to the largest ever raised in the United States, the crop of 1859-60 having been the largest.\n\nThe Charleston Courier gives some interesting information relative to the growing cotton crop. It says the unprofitable prices obtained for last year's crop made it necessary in the South that great economy should be used in the production of the present growth; the area was generally lessened from 15 to 20 per cent.; subsistence and wages were brought to the smallest cost; fertilisers were abandoned or purchased only in a limited way; and fortunately both corn and bacon were at reasonable rates, thereby greatly reducing plantation expenses. The early portion of the planting season was unpropitious over most of the South-west, in consequence of the continued rains preventing the usual working of the crop, causing an unmanageable growth of grass, and rendering it necessary in some instances to abandon parts of the planting. In the more Northerly parts of the cotton states the weather at the commencement was more favourable, and there was a promising appearance, but later a long drought inflicted considerable damage in some sections, which was followed by reports of caterpillars, rust, and worm, with unfavourable atmospheric conditions, the whole aspect indicating a much diminished crop. While all opinions must be largely speculative, the reduction of the growth to the extent of at least one million bales seems extremely probable, and the present outlook would perhaps indicate a crop for 1871-2 of 3,000,000 to 3,250,000 bales, the lesser figure being most likely if the season should continue to show an unfavourable character.\n\n**NOTE.—The above is worthy the attention of our Lagos and Abeokuta friends.—Ed.

Reviewing the prospects of the approaching planting, that journal states that the production of cotton has reached a point where it is likely to bring loss to the planter, unless the natives of India, Brazil, and Egypt turn their attention to other pursuits. Cotton can be grown as cheaply in the South as elsewhere, the advantages of climate and soil being so superior as to more than counterbalance the high price of labour. But in a close contest cotton producers in India, Brazil, and Egypt will not be easily forced to abandon its culture. Their wants are few, they are content with small profits, and they will, in all probability, it thinks, continue to produce just enough cotton to overstock the world when the American annual crop exceeds 2,500,000 bales. The losses sustained by the South on the incoming crop have caused a general belief that in 1871 only a small crop will be planted. At present prices the planter has little or no profit. He has laboured during the year for the public; the world is benefited by cheap cotton, but he is not. The question is one of profit and loss, and if the belief is general in the South that present prices are normal and not likely to improve less cotton will be produced. It is too early yet to state with exactness the intention of planters. The _Picayune_, and, indeed, the whole country, expect to see a great reduction in cotton acreage, but nothing has yet transpired that warrants the assertion that such will really be the case. From all parts of the South there is intelligence of a strong demand for labour. Planters are securing all the available labour in their respective districts, showing that they are far from being discouraged, and that the whole laboring force of the South is likely to be fully employed this year. While many planters are holding out for a reduction of wages, others are paying last year's rates. These facts do not warrant the conclusion that a large cotton crop is in anticipation. The _Picayune_ says it can only infer that as much land as possible will be cultivated, and that planters expect a more prosperous year is in store for them. The land will be put under cotton, corn, or other staple, as the planter deems proper. In Louisiana, which produces more cotton to the acre than any other State, there will be a great increase in the production of sugar. The old sugar planters are increasing their working force, and those who have hitherto cultivated cotton will turn their attention to sugar.

The beginning of the construction of the Oubangui network (AEF) dated from the war and, by 1926, 4200 km had been completed. However, only a few vehicles were seen using it and most of them were exclusively commercial. There were less than 1000 vehicles in 1930,1500 in 1931 and only 2850 in 1945, 600 of which were for tourism. 62 AOF, especially, made up for its railway deficiencies with roads. By 1937, 27000 km were open to 17229 vehicles, including nearly 10 000 trucks and light trucks. Between 1926 and 1934 highway projects and port improvements absorbed almost as much capital as the railways, amounting to F.frs 475 million as against F.frs 520 million. 63 Nevertheless, the infrastructure provided hardly had time to affect the volume of exports before the onset of the depression. To be sure, a certain number of territories offered a wide range of products: cotton, coffee, sugar cane, sisal and maize in Angola; coconuts, groundnuts and rice in Mozambique; wood in Gabon and the Ivory Coast; and bananas in Guinea. But exports continued to be based almost exclusively on minerals and oil-yielding plants. Few territories were as favourably situated as the Belgian Congo, whose improvement was based, at best, on two or three groups of products which, at least, were already partially processed. These were vegetable oil whose production increased from 2500 tonnes in 1914 to 9000 in 1921 and 65000 in 1930; and copper, which tripled between 1922 and 1931, from 43000 to 120000 tonnes before falling again the following year to 54000 tonnes, as a result of a reduction in production decided upon by international agreements.\nSource: S.

The huge distances between settlements and towns - Johannesburg is 1540 km from Cape Town and the sparseness of the population had hitherto ruled out the construction of railways as a viable proposition. But the discovery of gold and diamonds made railways and roads not only necessary but also practical. It is not surprising then that railway construction began in the 1870s from different points - Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban - all leading first to the diamond fields and then after 1886 into the Transvaal.

They demanded the transport and marketing infra› structure, seizing the opportunity as soon as a railway line was completed. In many cases, they pioneered before the colonial governments had built bridges and feeder roads. Seed for new crops were taken from the colonial governments, from missionaries, from European farms and from Africans who were already engaged in cultivation. Cocoa and coffee are the two best known and most important of the cash crops whose extension relied mainly on African initiatives. Minor crops such as tea, tobacco and pyrethreum also bear out the same principle. Besides, Africans fought specifically for crops which were better money-earners than others. In the case of cocoa, this meant cultivating lands which were only marginally suitable. At other times, African preference precipitated a struggle against discriminatory colonial legislation. Thus, the latter part of the 1920s and the early 1930s saw a determined effort on the part of Africans in several highland areas of Tanganyika to cultivate Arabica coffee rather than hire their labour out or grow the less profitable Robusta variety. The Africans won literally by planting coffee trees faster than the colonial administration could destroy them. 10 Where peasant cultivation established itself as the hegemonic form of the colonial economy, it functioned like mines and plantations in drawing labour resources from an area much wider than the actual zone of production. Senegambian groundnut farming attracted seasonal labour from the hinterland of the Senegal and Niger rivers; cocoa in the Gold Coast and in the Ivory Coast drew upon Upper Volta; while Ugandan coffee-growers turned to Ruanda-Urundi and Tanganyika to expand output. Together, cash-crop farming and the wage labour of mines and agri› culture accounted for the overwhelming majority of Africans who partici› pated directly in the colonial economy. However, a host of other activities were generated or transformed by the new commodity relationships. It was rather late before the extensive forest reserves of the continent were seriously maximized, but an extractive timber industry arose early in Gabon and in varying degrees some such enterprise was pursued wherever forest reserves existed.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': 'From the late fifteenth century onwards, Africa participated in the Europeoriented world economy as a peripheral and dependent sector. But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

In particular it seems that direct European involvement was counterproductive, as in the failed efforts at agricultural colonization in Waalo between 1819 and 1831,$^{21}$ and in the various efforts in Senegal, the southern Gold Coast, and Nigeria later on.$^{22}$ It was not that European personnel began to loom larger on the African scene; rather, the important change was that Europeans were largely displacing African merchants from The shift from the slave trade to palm oil strengthened the hand of private as against royal merchants (R. Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth.

Nonetheless, it served there, as it had in west-central Africa, as a dynamic disruptive and recon› structing force.

But what precisely was the link? I. Hrbek remarked some time ago on the importance of the years 1805-20 in African history. He observed the simultaneity of the following events: the Western Sudanese djihad of \'Uthman dan Fodio (Usman dan Fodio) (and other Islamic revolutions), the rise of the Zulu under Shaka, the eclipse of Bunyoro and the rise of Buganda in the interlacustrine region, the Fulbe (Fulani, Peul) revolutions in the Western Sudan, the modernizing regime of Muhammad \'AIT in Egypt, the unification of the Imerina on Madagascar under Radama I, and the rise of Omani hegemony under Sayyid Said.

Certainly this type of production had not been unknown in the tribute-based economies of the savanna: slaves worked the fields of the leading political families of the mussumba, for example. But, in the nineteenth century, the accumulation of captives by certain privileged groups often coincided with the rapid growth ofa marketrelated sector of the economy rather than with economic expansion due to increased payments of tribute-money. We have seen the result in the role played by 'domestic slaves' in the demographic and agricultural expansion of some of the communities in the region, such as the Kongo, Ovimbundu, and Ovambo.\nIn Angolan colonial society, the slave trade was likewise linked to the capitalist market economy, and had grown to sizeable proportions by the second half of the nineteenth century. In spite of certain legal tech› nicalities - slavery was formally abolished in Angola in 1878 - a slave labour sector was certainly the basis of the boom in cotton, plantation coffee, and especially sugar-cane production. At the end of the period under review, brandy distillation from Angolan sugar cane was the main object of trade with the sertäo.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'reliance on captives enabled free men to collect ivory, wax and rubber for overseas export. The Lozi aristocracy and landlords also used slaves to dig canals and ditches in order to bring fertile marshy soil into cultivation. By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position. To the extent that slaves acquired as corvØe labourers tended to become chattel, the nature of slavery often changed from earlier forms which emphasized the reproductive role and the use of slaves primarily to expand the size of the kinship network. accompanied the raids and the expansionist activities of the slave-traders. Fields were ravished, entire villages destroyed and survivors often com› pelled to flee their homelands and resettle in inaccessible, unproductive locations. One nineteenth-century traveller recalled the effect of the Yao raids in the 1860s against the Manganja: A number of the Manganja went with them. Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert. About midday they came upon a large party of Ajawa [Yao], who were just returning from a successful raid. The smoke of burning villages was seen in the distance.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts.

John Whitehead & Co., Preston.**—Four examples of the firm\'s famous brick-making machines were shown at Shrewsbury. The most important of these exhibits was a brick and drain-pipe making machine, which combines the four processes of hoisting the clay, crushing it between rollers, and pugging and moulding either into bricks or drain-pipes as required. The tables for receiving the bricks are on the patent side-delivery principle. The finish of the cut is clean and accurate, and the bricks are deposited on a movable board, from which they are transferred to the barrow without being handled. The output of this machine depends, of necessity, upon the nature and condition of the clay, but the average is about 18,000 bricks per day. Bricks with ornamental moulds—bullnose, bevelled, and various other shapes—are produced in this machine as readily as plain bricks, by simply changing the linings of the dies to suit the pattern desired. Drainage pipes of excellent quality are also made by this machine at a low cost. As will be understood, this machine is suited for operations of the most extensive kind. The other exhibits included brick and tile presses and a roofing-tile press. It may be added, that on every occasion on which the Royal Agricultural Society have given prizes for machinery of this description, Messrs. Whitehead have carried off premier honours.\n\n**Messrs. R. A. Lister & Co., Dursley, Gloucestershire.**—This active and enterprising firm showed in motion a series of three different sized newly-designed vertical stone mills. ""The Farmer\'s Stone Grinding Mills,"" as they are appropriately called, may be correctly described as the result of a lengthened experience in, and a careful study of, the particular work that machines of this kind are called upon to perform. They are specially adapted to meet, not only the need of farmers, millers, and corn dealers, but also those of condiment food manufacturers and others; for, in addition to grinding—and that in a thoroughly satisfactory manner—all kinds of grain suitable for bread-making or cattle-feeding, they may also be applied to the treatment of small seeds, spices, cement, emery, and other minerals. The small space they occupy, their simplicity both of construction and operation, and the ease with which they can be worked, are features which commend them to all who have occasion to use them.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Rubber, palm kernels, palm oil, and benni seed (an oil-producing substance) constitute the bulk of the exports of Sierra Leone. The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour. It is stated that in the 17th century the export of gold from Elmina reached as much as three millions sterling in one year.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained. For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Labour-saving Machines', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The same farm had in one field seven hundred acres of timothy;* of course it was not expected that this would ever be cut by hand.

One of the leading journals also says that it is taken for granted that the next ten years will witness an immense revolution in the method of cultivating the sugar and cotton fields, which, as a result, will vastly increase the crops, and, what is more, do away in a great measure with the need of negro labour. It will at first be urged, perhaps, in reply to this, as regards Africa, that in the substitution of capital for labour which such a change implies, many requisites will be found wanting in Africa—no capital—no horses—no mules—no trained oxen, &c., &c. We know there are difficulties in the way, but we know also that there is not one that may not be overcome—and that must and will be overcome—in the industrial regeneration of Africa, under which the wants of civilized man will have to be supplied to an extent that will render it necessary to make the exuberant productiveness of the African soil available for the purpose. We do not expect that the industrial change can take place in Africa without the co-operation of European and American civilization. But we hope ere long to see some establishments formed in Western Africa, in those parts where full security for life and property may be obtained, that will give the example and instruction which the Africans require, and lead to the introduction of those other elements which are indispensable in the work.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_07_1865#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## WHAT THE UPPER CONGO IS CAPABLE OF.\n\nIn coming to England this time, I selected the roundabout and long journey along the coast of Africa from the Congo to Sierra Leone, and I am glad I did so, as I have been able to judge, by comparison with other African rivers, what the Upper Congo was capable of. Among many other places, our steamer, the ""Kinsembo,"" touched at Duke Town, Old Calabar river. Duke Town and Creek Town, close by it, are situated about forty miles up the sea. Here I found that about 500 tons of palm oil were shipped every week, besides palm kernels, rubber, ebony, and other products of Africa. Now, Old Calabar is an exact reproduction of the Upper Congo in scenery and the character of its vegetation. From Bolobo to Stanley Falls, and up the Lunlungu, Ikelemba, Itimbiri, Lubilash, M\'bura, Arnrurimi, and M\'bungu rivers, the islands and mainland are covered with the oil-palm and rubber trees. Forests are draped with the orchilla weed; the gum-copal is so abundant that tons may be found among the boulders of the Cataract region, which have been washed down from the Upper Congo; the natives know where the largest deposits are to be found. This length of navigation, which has similar features to Old Calabar, is just twenty times the length of river that, in the Bight of Benin, contributes 500 tons of palm oil weekly. When developed to the same extent, this would furnish 10,000 tons weekly. We have also to reckon the ivory, no mean article of commerce, that could be collected from an area of 500,000 square miles, without risk; and also the ground-nuts, or their oil, which could be produced from the area of the Cataract region, where this plant is most in cultivation, besides valuable minerals. We have not reckoned the food products which could be exported within two years from the opening of the railway. In a comparatively brief time steamers departing daily from the mouth of the Congo could not convey the produce of the river and its immediate banks, provided always that the railways were adequate to transport the produce from the Pool. Without a railway it is lost time to dwell upon the products of that extensive region under consideration, as the whole of it is not worth a thought. Given a railway, and given that every enterprising soul is stimulated to carry on his business or industry on the banks of the river, assured that his communications are as easy as though settled at Sierra Leone, and that the Government which supervises him and his surroundings is generous and liberal, like that which the International Association is disposed to be, the conception of the future importance and value of this region to the markets of the world need be no great strain on the imagination.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

Written apropos of frequent fires in Abeokuta, and of the want of some non-inflammable material for the roofs of the air and light-excluding native hut, the writer shows how slowly the system hitherto pursued works for material improvement, and the need of efforts in an industrial direction: ""It is quite a question whether skilled labour should not in good policy take the lead, and reading and writing follow after, if not in point of time, yet in point of importance."" And again: ""Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance. It is difficult, as experience proves in the few efforts already made, to communicate hand knowledge, but where the welfare of a country is considered, difficulties should be less thought of."" The African-Aid Society and the African Times have never spoken out more strongly than this. Truth will make its way, in spite of prejudice and jealousy. The ""native who returned from the Brazils,"" and who was sent out to Abeokuta under the auspices of the African-Aid Society, gives a faint foreshadowing of the material advancement in Africa that will some day result from the return of the African race in America to the lands of their forefathers. Had not some of the missionary body in Abeokuta opposed the sending of such people from America by the African-Aid Society, many brick and tile makers, and other valuable artisans, might now have been established there. We are glad to see that a change is coming over the spirit of our friends in that place. America will soon have many choice workmen and agriculturists from among its emancipated slaves, ready to bring their industrial knowledge to the assistance of the land of their forefathers.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed.

There are four European factories here—two English, a German, and a Portuguese. The principal, indeed, almost the only export is rubber, of which about two hundred and fifty thousand pounds are annually shipped from here. The palm oil tree flourishes in the country round about here, but the natives do not understand how to procure the oil from it, just as on other parts of the coast where rubber trees are in abundance, the export consists almost entirely of palm oil, as the natives do not understand how to procure the rubber. The people round about here seem a quiet and inoffensive race, and friendly to Europeans, whom, unlike the tribes on other parts of the coast, they do not attempt to prevent proceeding inland for the purposes of trade. The great difficulty in the country about here is the want of communication; there are no rivers, no roads, and consequently native labour has to be employed for the conveyance of produce, which, as the native is dilatory in his movements, is an expensive means of locomotion. The consequence is that rubber, which can be bought for the equivalent of about 2d. a pound at the place of production, by the time it has reached here for shipment, costs about 8d., or about 300 per cent. for cost of conveyance. Still, as the value of it on arrival in England is at present about one shilling and sixpence, there is still a fair margin for profit. The country abounds with rubber-producing trees, and arboriculture of the gum-producing species of all kinds.

In this connexion it will be of interest to give some account of what has been done further south in the Lake Nyassa region by an English company, the ""African Lakes Company,"" who have been working quietly for eight years with marked success.\n\nThose familiar with Livingstone\'s later explorations will remember that his investigations resulted in the discovery of the great Lake Nyassa, which empties its waters into the Zambesi, the Shire serving as a conduit. The dream of his life was to utilize the extensive waterway for the introduction of commerce, in order that the tribes there might have a chance of turning the wealth of their country to good account, and not be dependent for every yard of calico or string of beads. Livingstone sank his whole means in developing this idea, and his failure showed what should be avoided in the future, and what insisted upon. In common with all African rivers, the Shire has its cataracts, and thus a clear run from the Indian Ocean up from the Zambesi to Lake Nyassa is impossible. A ""portage"" of 75 miles half-way between the lake and the Zambesi is a necessity. However, with the help of some old comrades, a new attempt was resolved upon in the year 1878. Mr. E. D. Young, a gunner in the Royal Navy and Livingstone\'s factotum, had seen just where the breaking point lay previously, and when he was invited to assist in resuscitating plans he rendered invaluable service. Sent out by the Royal Geographical Society to investigate the story of Livingstone\'s reported murder in 1866, he was able to try thoroughly the experiment of transporting boats in sections. His vessel, the Search, was put together under the supervision of the Admiralty authorities, and proved a perfect success during Mr. Young\'s most successful adventure. With the experience of this last trip in hand, Mr. Young received a commission from the Established and Free Churches of Scotland to provide them with a similar steam vessel, and the Ilala was built and placed on Lake Nyassa at the service of the missionaries.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Moreover, Shepstone, the key source of information in the 1870s for British policy-makers and operators, was not only concerned about immediate solutions to the problem of securing African labour for the British capital› ists, but looked further to see the solution to the whole problem as lying in a federation of the white states with a common African policy. Clearly, therefore, some accounts of British imperialism in South Africa have neglected the growing economic importance of the region to Britain, a situation which became increasingly apparent at the end of the 1860s with the discovery of diamonds and reports of gold deposits, and most evident in the i88os when gold began to be mined in the Witwatersrand.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""The role of the European commercial firms has been assessed by many scholars, most of whom agree on the significance of connecting Africa with markets in Western Europe and the Americas.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': 'The combination of European capital with coerced African labour registered a sizeable surplus in products destined for European consump› tion and export.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods.

Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction.

Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

We should be clear that traders tend to favour free trade if they have a competitive advantage in the market and tend to see ways of restraining free trade if and when they do not. Hence the fact that the role of the chartered companies in eighteenth-century West Africa was less than in the seven› teenth century has led some historians to speak of the rise of free trade. The very process of dismantling of the monopoly powers of chartered companies was however 'a gradual one', we are told; the shift to free trade 'was therefore somewhat limited'; and the explanation of the shift resided primarily in 'practical business reasons', to wit, the lower overhead costs and greater flexibility of response to an expanding slave-trade market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Southern Africa', 'content': ""In southern Africa the process of incorporation was once again somewhat different, both because there was no slave-exporting and because of the presence of a white-settler community.

Atmore and S.

But, of course, that is just the point. In the nineteenth century, they were willy-nilly incorporated into the world-economy, and their behaviour was a function of this reality. world-economy. This political shift, however, itself reflected the long upturn and expansion of the world-economy. The British basically lost little time in beginning to restructure production processes so as to incorporate effectively the region. They increased shipping markedly, brought in new British colonists, and developed commercial sheep-rearing such that by the mid-1840s the Cape Colony had become a significant locus of pro› duction for the world-economy.$^{27}$ Later, Natal became a locus of sugar production on plantations using indentured Indian labour."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control. Towards the end of this period, however, the rise of Germany as a major Western power was beginning to increase the competition that already existed. Outside the East African sphere, tensions caused by this competition were already beginning to appear. When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

H. Lever, the Liverpool soap and margarine tycoon, and societies such as the British Cotton Growing Association between 1906 and 1925 for the estab› lishment of plantations in British West Africa, and indeed a few plantations were established in the Gold Coast, Southern Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Delayed incorporation of eastern Africa', 'content': 'The eastern coast of Africa was also still relatively outside the capitalist world-economy.

Nonetheless, it served there, as it had in west-central Africa, as a dynamic disruptive and recon› structing force.

In a perceptive passage he contends: France sought compensation for European loss in overseas gain. England would offset her European isolation by enlarging and glorify› ing the British empire.

The lesser powers, with no great prestige at stake, managed to get on without any new imperialism, though Portugal and Holland displayed a revived pride in the empires they already possessed and the latter's was administered with renewed vigor. 1S Hayes concludes therefore that 'the new imperialism' was basically 'a nationalistic phenomenon' and that its proponents hankered after national prestige. European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

A week or two's treatment at home will probably restore his health. After his return he had to spend many weeks at Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, the headquarters of the work of the Scotch planters and of the missionaries of the Scotch Established Church. Mr. Thomson was very much struck with the remarkable progress which has been made here. Extensive areas are under coffee plantations, and the coffee produced commands the highest price in Mincing Lane. Successful experiments are being made with sugar, tea, tobacco, and other crops, and constant additions are being made to the cultivated area. The natives come 200 and 300 miles to work in their plantations, and are the very men who a few years ago devastated the whole region. There is an ample supply of cheap labour. The white population here have learned that if they are to succeed in Africa they must try to make themselves at least as comfortable as they would be in England. They live in well-built houses, with large rooms, fitted with comfort and taste, and what is for Africa a luxury. The table appointments are as attractive as they are in houses of taste at home. The libraries contain copies of all the best books, and there is a constant supply of all the best periodical literature published in Europe and America. The Scotch missionaries at Blantyre go about their work in a most effective way. They are not content with mere day schools; they have large boarding houses where they put up 200 to 300 boys and youths, mostly the sons of chiefs. These are entirely under the care of the missionaries, and so much do the lads like the life they lead that they often spend their holidays at Blantyre instead of going home. The missionaries are thoroughly practical men. They teach the youths handicrafts of all kind, as well as educate their tastes and their moral sense. English games are in vogue, and during play-time the missionaries themselves may be seen taking part in a game of football with their dusky pupils. Many of their pupils when they leave build good houses for themselves in the neighbourhood of Blantyre, marry one wife, and otherwise show that their training has been to some purpose. There is a church recently built at Blantyre. It was designed by one of the missionaries, and would do credit to many a London suburb. It is a remarkable piece of work considering the circumstances. It is like a miniature cathedral, with beautiful apse, dome, double towered west front, and many graceful adornments. It was built entirely by the natives under the supervision of the whites. The natives baked the bricks, made the lime, hewed the timber, and did everything that a skilled labourer at home would do. All the materials were found on the spot except the internal fittings, the glass, and some portions of the roofing. This is a solid achievement which surely goes a long way to answer those who maintain that the native African can never be trained to do anything. The services in this church are conducted in the most decorous fashion, the missionaries evidently belonging to the more advanced section of the Scotch Church. Mr. Thomson also speaks highly of the work of the Free Church missionaries further up the lake, who have now some thousands of young people under their care. The problem of residence in Central Africa has practically been solved in Nyassaland, and on the same lines may be solved elsewhere. Now that the Lakes Company has been absorbed in the British South Africa Company we may expect even more enterprise than in the past. Blantyre can now be reached in six weeks from England by the Cape, and in time to come we shall probably see this time shortened.""}, {'id': 6545, 'article_title': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE GOLD COAST AT LIVERPOOL.', 'full_section_title': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE GOLD COAST AT LIVERPOOL.', 'last_edit_date': '03-15-1895', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1895#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_04_1895', 'content': 'On Friday, March 15, a meeting of the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce was held to confer with the new Governor of the Gold Coast, Mr. W.

After countless generations have despised Africa, there seems now to be a disposition to go to the other extreme and imagine that untold wealth is about to flow from the interior of this continent. The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products. By-and-by, when they are taught, they will begin to cultivate the soil and raise products which are in demand in Europe. Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world. The chartered companies meanwhile will, no doubt, do fairly well, not making great returns, but sufficient to repay their shareholders for their investment, while developing and creating a great country and a large market for our manufactures. As to the demand for\n\nour goods, that is a question that need not trouble us. The natives are fully alive to the advantage of British manufactures, and they will take any amount. The demand is only limited by what they can give in return, and the offer of British goods is the inducement which the companies hold out to them to produce the wealth of their own country.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1888#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A New African Market for English Manufactures', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. George Baden-Powell recently addressed a letter on this subject to a contemporary, from which we extract the following: Europeans in the middle ages appropriated all it could of America, Africa, and Asia under the pretext of the conversion of the heathen. In these days English expansion penetrates these continents under the plea of exchanging English manufactures for native raw material. Now the Germans on the east and Internationalists on the west are doing their best to open up the interior of Africa to English manufactures. But Englishmen should not forget that on the south the English taxpayer has recently paid for the opening out of a trade route which is capable of tapping all Africa below 10deg. south latitude—a vast district rich in ivory, and probably in gold also, and containing a large population which is rapidly placing a value on English manufactures. Sir Charles Warren has opened up a good road, with watering places and telegraph all along, so far as Shoshong, which is situated at 22deg. south; the whole way lies on a healthy table-land, three to five thousand feet above the sea-level, and connecting at Kimberley with a railway system in direct communication with the Cape Town docks. Provided this new road be preserved free under English control, Shoshong will rapidly become the centre of converging trade routes, tapping all districts lying to the south of the Congo and Zanzibar areas.\n\nThree or four years ago the people around Shoshong made their own copper wire and axe-heads, and clothed themselves in skins of their own killing and curing. Now they are buying English piece-goods, Sheffield hardware, and even Birmingham screws. English goods are steadily and even rapidly advancing northwards into the African interior by this route. English export manufacturers would do well at once to form a committee or syndicate to watch this newly-opened up trade entrance into the populated interior of Central Africa, for it may become at least as important as the Congo or Zanzibar routes.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Value of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Altogether our West African possessions do a trade with Great Britain (mainly with Liverpool, London, and Bristol) of about £5,000,000 yearly, give honourable employment to some 770 of our British fellow-countrymen, and bring at least 5,000,000 of intelligent (Sierra Leone), sturdy (Krumen), industrious (Gold Coast), artistic (Yoruba), brave (Niger), good-tempered (Oil Rivers) negroes under our sway. I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of Tropical Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. H. H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised. Speaking of the native population, he pointed out that they were distributed into irregularly\n**167**', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'West Africa is one of the richest mineral regions on the planet, and England has been given an entrance to it for the purpose of spreading a civilisation and Christianity that will not do harm to the cause of the Gospel or bring disgrace on morality.

Why have we not been in Bambara years ago? A light railway should have been run up to the north-east. The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers. They are tapping all that rich region while we remain inert.\n\nWest Africa has, from interested motives, been represented as unhealthy for Europeans. This illusion is being rapidly dispelled by disinterested travellers. The Englishman, through unhealthy habits, may dig his own grave even in England, as so many thousands do annually. Besides, were London as innocent of sanitary arrangements as Freetown, it would soon become the white man\'s grave in grim reality. A man unaddicted to drink and gluttony may live, and does live, an enjoyable life in West Africa; he enjoys it so much that, like Emin Pasha, he refuses to be rescued. Officers and others have told me they preferred being out there for a time, not only because they liked the life, but because ""dear old Cox"" has been able to transfer the balance of their account from the debit to the credit side.\n\nWest Africa is the coming country; it teems with wealth; it is within easy distance of this country, and can be brought within six days of the London market if necessary.

Some of these vegetable products grow wild. Horses, camels, and sheep, can be bred in the north-east. The list of articles to be found on the coast reads like the inventory of a Liverpool warehouse. The wealth of West Africa is simply boundless, illimitable.

But, putting all conjectural treasure aside, over all the coast regions, and up the Sabaki river, there is ample scope for plantation work.

""lint cotton"" (Sea Island), 140,000lb. of cotton seed, and 20,000lb. of refuse. Samples have been valued at a higher assessment than that of American cotton then in the market. According to returns the profit on an expenditure of under £1,200 was £370, or over 30 per cent. In Liverpool this cotton, is pronounced ""better than any but the best Egyptian.""

As is perhaps only natural, the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce strongly protested against the extension of the authority of the Royal Niger Company over any portion of the Oil Rivers, and they point out that only two years ago the grant of a Royal Charter was refused to this very district. No doubt the presence of a large trading company, endued with special and exceptional powers, has a tendency to dwarf other commercial undertakings in the same district. But the Government are necessarily swayed by broader considerations than the advantage or disadvantage of certain individual traders. Their chief object is to provide for the administration of the particular district. The existence of chartered companies is only tolerable in uncivilised or semi-civilised countries, where the presence of a strong commercial interest may often enable the governing body to provide for the administration of the district without the great expense that would have to be incurred by the home Government if they attempted the direct administration themselves. The history of the development of India under the fostering rule of the Honourable East India Company proves the correctness of this theory, and to her Majesty's ministers it appears that the Royal Niger Company occupies an analogous position in its own district. The charter which was granted to the Niger Company some years ago is sufficiently careful in safeguarding the interests of others, and the success which has attended its administration of the district in question appears fully to justify an extension of its authority in the direction of the Oil Rivers.

Mr. Johnston's theory is that England should enlarge its borders to the utmost. British trade is the lever he proposes for the enlightenment of the black race. The more the territory which is acquired the more can that influence be exerted. With British trade the appliances of European civilisation are bound to advance.\n\nThey will fast educate the negro both morally and intellectually.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade.

No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A CALL TO ACTION IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The value of Lancashire mill property has decreased one-half during the last three years.

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553.

The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads.

Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts.

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone.

Equally guilty of overstatement are those colonial apologists, such as Gann, Duignan and Lloyd who see colonialism as an unqualified blessing for Africa as well as those like Perham and Fieldhouse who see the record as a balanced one. A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development. Finally, metro› politan industries benefited from cheap raw materials obtained from the colonies and profits made from the export of manufactured goods. When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': 'From the late fifteenth century onwards, Africa participated in the Europeoriented world economy as a peripheral and dependent sector.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

It is a conglomerate, and the pebbles have broken through in the blasting as straight as if they had been cut with a knife.\n\nIn conclusion, I can only say I hope the mines of Africa may have a large success, and that everybody connected with them may work harmoniously together.

The Mbiam did not protect him from harm at the markets. The Umön people, last month, seized all his market goods to the value of 400l., cut his house canoe to pieces, killed some of his men, and wounded others, and he himself narrowly escaped with his life. Archibong Edem believes this is a judgment from God upon him, and, therefore, he has given up persecuting people going to the new church.\n\nThe married supercargoes made a big palaver with Oriök for telling somebody that informed you that he gave them wives. I am much grieved at my countrymen taking so much trust from the supercargoes, who often threaten to make them slaves, break their houses and yards, and take from them all their furniture for their debt. The traders say of them: They have nothing; everything they have belongs to us; and with our money they trade. The supercargoes have made us poor, and themselves rich. The profit they make on our labour and produce must be great; some of them came here poor boys, now they say they are rich men. The profits of our palm oil, &c., have built a number of large houses and store-houses, maintain thirty Europeans here, their families and companies at home in comfort, sixty Accra coopers, and 300 Kroomen.'}, {'id': 5636, 'article_title': 'England in East Africa', 'full_section_title': 'England in East Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1888#article-12', 'issue_date': '02_01_1888', 'content': 'Dr. Piesse, F.I.C., F.C.S., says: ""Perfectly pure and wholesome cordial.""  \nWine Trade Review says: ""Pronounced by Dutch experts to be excellent, and worthy to be recommended.""  \nAnti-Adulteration Review says: ""Free from Fusel Oil.""  \nThe Caterer says: ""None but the best materials used in Mr. Nolet\'s establishment.""\n\n**BULFIELD & CO., 37, CRUTCHED FRIARS, LONDON, E.C.**'}, {'id': 5957, 'article_title': 'MR.

He knew that the impression they had acquired from various sources was that the beneficent results were enormous; but he had been enabled to see for himself the nature of those results and to draw his own conclusions, and he appeared before them to put a pin into the beautiful iridescent bubble which they had blown for themselves with the materials supplied by the ignorant, the interested, the colour-blind, and the hopelessly biassed. Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed. A large portion of the trade was doubtless in slaves, but still that alone could never have accounted for the prosperity and wealth of the merchants who traded with Western Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""A Liberian's View of the African Problem"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following extracts from a recent letter of the Rev.

I said to some of them: \'You are spending millions of money on a line in which it must be wasted. Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty. The enterprises in East Africa, both of Englishmen and Germans, are only commercial movements, not colonisation, and are not only liable to but will share the fate which has befallen all great European, secular or religious, movements in equatorial Africa. You rightly consider that the agents in the work of Africa\'s regeneration are the civilised and Christianised negroes now in exile. Mahometanism, notwithstanding the sneers of some and the ignorance of others, is doing a wonderful work in Africa, really preserving the people against the unscrupulous proceedings of European traders and adventurers. The Arabs can do no harm, they as readily follow as lead in negro land. Jesus Christ as a religious reformer and as a regenerator of all the races of mankind was right. These organisations, which undertake to represent Him among foreign races, have not yet half understood Him, and He will not endorse work which not only contravenes the spirit but the letter of his teachings. After Europe shall have been purged of the wrongs which it has inflicted upon Africa, and has got rid of the gold unjustly acquired through the blood of the children of the Dark Continent, then it may be given to these would-be-masters of humanity to see the proper course both for their own and Africa\'s weal.""', 'last_edit_date': '1889-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_08_1889#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What the Royal Niger Company is Doing for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It should be borne in mind by those who look for quick and fabulous returns from their investments that Africa occupies a singular position.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products. By-and-by, when they are taught, they will begin to cultivate the soil and raise products which are in demand in Europe. Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

And this would have been the sure result of working with inadequate capital. Money makes money. Nowhere is this more true than in Africa. Africa has given good crops to the little silver sickles that have been thrust into her rich fields of produce. But to reap her great harvests, she wants what has been wanted everywhere for the like purpose—a heavy golden scythe, that shall mow down her abundant crops. Unless we are greatly mistaken, we have obtained this for the Niger and Chadda and other rich districts in the Company of African Merchants. We look to India—the East Indies—and contemplate what a rich and powerful company did there for a land and people torn in pieces by intestine feuds, and poor in the midst of wealth. The past of other countries has been preparing the future of that Africa which has been for centuries engaged in aiming incessant blows within herself at the very principle of vitality in nations—at the very foundation of all territorial wealth—the human life with which she so abounded. Africa may be said to have done nothing as regards her own future benefit, save to make universal and incessant efforts to retard and to prevent it. She has not laboured at all to build up the structure of her future greatness. She might have done so, had not the Christian nations of Europe assisted the followers of Mahomet in setting every man's hand against his brother for gain, throughout the whole length and breadth of the continent. Thenceforward she became an active agent in her own debasement. And well she has laboured in the work, gathering continually harvests of misery and woe. British repentance, first ardently preached by Clarkson, Buxton, Wilberforce, and kindred spirits, terminated the long era of her continuously-advancing degradation. A new one commenced. Under it progress has been slow, but constant. If a nation be not born in a day, how much less shall a vast continent be rapidly lifted from so deep an abyss as that into which Africa has been plunged, and set upon the moral and industrial elevation where alone she can justify her natural claim of equality—physical, industrial, moral, and intellectual—among the great divisions of the earth. She could only achieve it by the aid of some of those anterior civilizations which had blindly helped and tempted to her dire disgrace, by wresting from her her sons and daughters, to be slaves in other lands."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Twenty Years in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Prior to 1876—the year from which we may date the new advance in West Africa—much, of course, had been discovered about the territory which was presently to be parcelled out among continental aspirants for colonial empires and this country. Livingstone and Stanley had been busily occupied filling up the map. The secret of the source of the Niger had long been known, and the river itself had been left, in the main, to numerous private traders, who had competed keenly one with another. In 1879 the whole of the English firms doing business on the river coalesced and formed one large company, under the name of the United or National African Company. This combination was a part, and no small part, of the new European movement in Africa. It was formed to combat foreign competition, which had been growing at a rate that augured badly for British interests if resources and efforts remained divided. In this connexion, and in illustration of the view that Africa is being at last treated as a continent, as a theatre of empire and a means of national aggrandisement, Mr. Lucas notes what European peoples were once strong in Africa, and who are they that now prevail.\n\n""The Portuguese,"" he says, ""are still there, but with only a shadow of their former strength; the English are there; the French are there. One European Power, the Dutch, for many years the strongest of all, has now no place at all in Africa, though the Dutch race is perpetuated in the south, under English or Republican Government. On the other hand, the Germans, who, except for the few years when the Brandenburghers traded on the Guinea Coast, never had any footing in Africa, have lately taken a prominent position among the Europeans who are in so lordly a manner slicing up the continent. The Dutch were, above all others, a trading and carrying people. They went to Africa—at any rate, to West Africa—as carriers, and when the carrying trade over the Atlantic came to an end their connexions with West Africa gradually died away. Weak as Holland is when compared with Great Britain, or France, or Germany, she still holds her East Indian and West Indian possessions; but since West Africa has ceased to be what she once was, the scene of a series of depôts from which ships fetched human wares, she has left the Guinea Coast apparently for ever. Meanwhile, a new Power—Germany—has made its appearance. The Germans, no doubt, like all other peoples, look in their colonial enterprises to securing trade for the mother country; but they have taken their place in Africa under, and in full harmony with, the new set of conditions. They have come there as a continental people to a continent, not as a sea-going merchant people to a coast. They have come, not like the Prussians of old, to build and hold on sufferance small factories, but to rule, or claim to rule, to protect, or claim to protect, large areas of territory. They belong as distinctively to the new-order of things as the Dutch belonged to the old.""', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What the Royal Niger Company is Doing for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It looks as if chartered companies were the destined means of opening up and civilizing the Dark Continent. What the newly chartered East Africa Company are proposing to accomplish on the East Coast, the Royal Niger Company are doing on the West, and apparently with more success than the colonial Governments which draw their life from Downing-street. Lord Aberdare is Governor of the Royal Niger Company, and Sir George Taubman-Goldie Deputy-Governor; and in conversation with the latter a representative elicited some information as to the operations of the corporation. First of all, as to the difficulties which such companies have to encounter, they may be put down under three heads. The first great obstacle is this, that negroes have everything to learn. They have been accustomed hitherto to supply their immediate wants, and nothing more, so that beyond this minimum they have to be taught everything. It is slow work to teach them how to produce articles which are in request in Europe. A trade has been gradually growing up, but that only extends to certain regions, and, unfortunately for Western Africa, the articles of trade which have thus come into use—palm oil, for instance—have fallen very largely in price, as much as 50 per cent. That has been one of the great difficulties of the past three or four years. In the second place, there is the labour difficulty. Being unaccustomed to labour, they are averse to it. The Niger Company has had less to contend with in this respect than those in other parts of Africa, for although the natives near the coast are naturally idle, those in the interior are of more industrious habits. Some day imported labour will be necessary—either Chinese or coolie—not to extirpate the natives, but to serve as an example. The third great difficulty is the climate. Near the seaboard the country is undoubtedly pestilential. As you leave the mangrove swamps and palm forests behind and reach the interior, you come to a climate which, while totally unfit for European colonization, is fully as healthy as many parts of India. The difficulties arising from the climate are, therefore, not insuperable, if proper precautions are taken.\n\nWith respect to European jealousies and interference, there seems no ground for alarm on that score. The newspapers have reported that German merchants have complained of the administration of the Niger Company, but as a matter of fact there is not a single German trader in the whole of the Company's territory. There was one some time ago, but he was tried and deported by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., for a long period Chief Justice of the Gold Coast Colony, and now of the Niger territories. His offence was inciting the natives to rebellion and bloodshed. The whole case of the German Colonial Society in Berlin thus falls to the ground."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1888#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN PROBLEM', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the fifteenth century the Congo country was the scene of extensive operations.

They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources.

It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed. The veil, which was being drawn aside, was replaced, and darkness enveloped the land.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1890#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed.

The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship.

Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""Was the colonial impact on Africa in the economic field, then, such a very enviable one?

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads. Nor were they meant to facilitate inter-African travel and communication. Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts. In the second place, such economic growth as occurred in the colonies was based on the natural resources of the area and this meant therefore that areas not naturally endowed were totally neglected.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

Rodney has pointed out above (Chapter 14), every sector of the African community including even the pastoral groups, who were noted for their conservatism, had been drawn into the money economy by the 1920s.$^{18}$ Again, the effects of this shift were very significant. In the first place, even by the 1930s, a new standard of wealth had been introduced which was based not only on the number of sheep or cows or yams one possessed but on actual cash. Secondly, people were engaged in activities not for subsistence alone but also to earn money which, in turn, led, as will be seen later, to the emergence of a new class of wage earners and salaried groups. Thirdly, the introduction of the money economy led to the commencement of banking activities in Africa, which have become another significant feature of the economy of independent African states.\nThe introduction of currency and with it banking activities and the tremendous expansion in the volume of trade between colonial Africa and Europe in turn led to what A.

Thus, under the colonial system, Africans were in most cases made to produce what they did not consume and to consume what they did not produce, clear evidence of the lopsided and exploitive nature of the colonial economy. In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.756, 'probability_score': 0.054, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': ""Furthermore, Africans were forbidden to grow certain crops. In Kenya, for instance, Africans were forbidden to grow coffee, 'by far the most lucrative cash crop' in the country.$^{41}$ It was not until the 1950s that this European monopoly was shattered by Mau Mau.\nThe main result of all these steps was the proletarianization of the African peasantry, which appears to have taken place on a larger scale in Southern Rhodesia than in the other countries under discussion.$^{42}$ Thus African labour employed by Europeans at starvation wages produced cash crops for both the home market and for export. In Kenya, by 1927, between 83700 and 117 000 Africans, or more than 50% of total wage labour, worked in commercial agriculture. The leading crops were maize, coffee, wheat and sisal. Maize occupied only 325 ha in 1905; by 1920 it occupied nearly 12500 ha, and nine years later the area had risen to over 90000 ha.$^{43}$ By the early 1920s the settlers had ousted African peasants from the production and trade of this important staple. The area under coffee also recorded a dramatic expansion, rising from 32 ha in 1905, reaching over 11250 ha in 1920, and shooting up to nearly 39000 ha ten years later.$^{44}$ In 1913 coffee and maize exports earned the country £64991; in 1920 export of these two crops and sisal earned £566556 and their value reached £2429655 in 1930, with coffee accounting for more than 50%.$^{4S}$ These developments led to significant structural changes. In 1913, the exclusive African sector contributed 24% of the value of total domestic exports while the exclusive European sector contributed only 5%.

Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone.

But the precarious living standard was vulnerable to the slightest upset, and collapsed with the depression.

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

I said to some of them: \'You are spending millions of money on a line in which it must be wasted. Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty. The enterprises in East Africa, both of Englishmen and Germans, are only commercial movements, not colonisation, and are not only liable to but will share the fate which has befallen all great European, secular or religious, movements in equatorial Africa. You rightly consider that the agents in the work of Africa\'s regeneration are the civilised and Christianised negroes now in exile. Mahometanism, notwithstanding the sneers of some and the ignorance of others, is doing a wonderful work in Africa, really preserving the people against the unscrupulous proceedings of European traders and adventurers.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Produce Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that has just expired has witnessed the continuance and, indeed, the aggravation of that painful depression in the trade of West Africa which existed in 1886.

In the present famine of gold, it is very necessary that all sources of supply of the precious metal should be utilized; but until the conditions under which mining is pursued on the coast of Africa are fundamentally altered, the person who would invest money in the exploitation of gold mines would be very sanguine and would prove also very unfortunate.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL DEPRESSION ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The most unpleasant side of the question to me is that, after these inexperienced European merchants have so imprudently supplied goods to adventurous traders without securities, or worthless securities (and many a time without any reference to the Coast respecting the pecuniary status or reputation of the consignee), they are only too ready to brand all Africans as a race of dishonest robbers. A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

What the newly chartered East Africa Company are proposing to accomplish on the East Coast, the Royal Niger Company are doing on the West, and apparently with more success than the colonial Governments which draw their life from Downing-street. Lord Aberdare is Governor of the Royal Niger Company, and Sir George Taubman-Goldie Deputy-Governor; and in conversation with the latter a representative elicited some information as to the operations of the corporation. First of all, as to the difficulties which such companies have to encounter, they may be put down under three heads. The first great obstacle is this, that negroes have everything to learn. They have been accustomed hitherto to supply their immediate wants, and nothing more, so that beyond this minimum they have to be taught everything. It is slow work to teach them how to produce articles which are in request in Europe. A trade has been gradually growing up, but that only extends to certain regions, and, unfortunately for Western Africa, the articles of trade which have thus come into use—palm oil, for instance—have fallen very largely in price, as much as 50 per cent. That has been one of the great difficulties of the past three or four years. In the second place, there is the labour difficulty. Being unaccustomed to labour, they are averse to it. The Niger Company has had less to contend with in this respect than those in other parts of Africa, for although the natives near the coast are naturally idle, those in the interior are of more industrious habits. Some day imported labour will be necessary—either Chinese or coolie—not to extirpate the natives, but to serve as an example. The third great difficulty is the climate. Near the seaboard the country is undoubtedly pestilential. As you leave the mangrove swamps and palm forests behind and reach the interior, you come to a climate which, while totally unfit for European colonization, is fully as healthy as many parts of India. The difficulties arising from the climate are, therefore, not insuperable, if proper precautions are taken.\n\nWith respect to European jealousies and interference, there seems no ground for alarm on that score. The newspapers have reported that German merchants have complained of the administration of the Niger Company, but as a matter of fact there is not a single German trader in the whole of the Company's territory. There was one some time ago, but he was tried and deported by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., for a long period Chief Justice of the Gold Coast Colony, and now of the Niger territories. His offence was inciting the natives to rebellion and bloodshed. The whole case of the German Colonial Society in Berlin thus falls to the ground."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1888#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now comes the labour question.

Kroomen only engage to serve for from twelve to eighteen months; then they want to go back to their own country, and you have to get a fresh gang; so that, just as you get your Kroomen properly trained into your way of working, and they become really valuable, they go away, and are succeeded by a gang of strangers, many of whom are quite untrained in labour in Coast work.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': 'The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals.

The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Economic zones and trading networks', 'content': ""Finally, the network of the tribute-based economy terminated at such centres as the mussutnba, Bunkeya, or capitals of small chiefdoms or the markets of non-centralized communities.

The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century. On the whole, the Atlantic slave trade, even the clandestine operations, died out in the course of the 1850s, although in the lower Zaire river area it survived outside Portuguese control until the disappearance of the last of the slave markets in Latin America towards the end of the i86os.\nDuring the remainder of the century, exports from Angola were limited to a few agricultural products (such as coffee and sugar) and especially, products obtained by gathering - mostly wax and ivory - though during the last three decades of the century a greater variety of exported products were gathered, such as wild coffee, copal, palm oil and, later, more import¬ antly, natural rubber."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Minerals', 'content': 'The export sectors of the countries under discussion had two major characteristics.

Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage.

In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys.

By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650. The numbers by 1750 were about triple those of 1650. 4"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

As the result of the experiments of the past year, we are convinced that more profit will be realised by planting the *best kinds of native cotton* than by raising the imported varieties. True, Sea Island cotton can be raised here, but it is an uncertain crop, liable to be destroyed by bad cultivation, by insects, and unfavourable weather. The native cotton is much more hardy, and some kinds are but little inferior to the Sea Island. We have recently seen some specimens of native cotton of most excellent quality, and we believe that if sufficient pains were taken in the selection of seed, the quality and quantity of cotton raised from native seed would be greatly improved. As the cotton-planting season is now near at hand, we hope that those who intend planting cotton will give the best varieties a fair trial.""\n\n""We learn that the Company of African Merchants are about to commence business in the Sherboro, and expect to give special attendance to the preparation of fibres of the palm, pine-apple, &c.

Going back fifty years ago, to 1836, we find no definite statistics for the Gold Coast; while Gambia exported no less than in 1875—£147,000. The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony. The value of the rubber exported is about £6,000 annually. Nearly three-fourths of the ground nuts exported go to France.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS COMMISSIONERSHIP', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants.

The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour. It is stated that in the 17th century the export of gold from Elmina reached as much as three millions sterling in one year.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained. For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites.

Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

The demand for kola nuts was reported to be at all times considerable in Brazil, but in view of the slowness of the passage and the difficulty of keeping them in marketable condition, the value has at no time during the past six years exceeded £3,563, while in 1877 it sank as low as £304. Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Page 154\n\nIts value.

This is brought down from the interior, and retains a large proportion of the fat or gelatine, from the fact, probably, that it is from the recently living animals. In this state it is called green ivory. It is not so white as the kinds called white ivory, which have been lying a longer time exposed to the heat of the sun until the animal matter has disappeared. The excellence of green ivory consists in its greater toughness and in its growing whiter by age, instead of yellow, as is the case with the whiter varieties. Yet buyers of cutlery, through ignorance of these qualities, usually prefer the whiter kinds, which on that account are more in demand for the Sheffield trade, and have more than doubled in price since 1879.\n\nThe sales of ivory occur every three months at London and Liverpool, and sales are also held at irregular intervals at Rotterdam. At Liverpool, only ivory of the best quality is offered. Buyers from Germany and France and agents of American consumers attend these sales; and it is estimated that about one quarter of the whole amount goes to Sheffield, another quarter to London, and the other half to Germany, France, and the United States. There is just now great anxiety as to the future supply of ivory. The stocks in public warehouses are smaller than for many years past, and the rapid increase in prices is causing great anxiety to manufacturers. At a recent sale at Liverpool, the best African ivory sold by the ton at over 12s. 6d. per pound. This will explain the fact that the principal factor in the value of the best table cutlery is the handle. When the ivory comes into the hands of the cutler, much skill is required to make the most of the material, and every scrap is turned to account. After cutting out the scales of all sizes for pocket-knives, and the solid handles for table cutlery, the small pieces are usually sold to the button-makers, or may be made into pearls.

1099,"Colonial compensation practices in Africa were often inadequate and unfair, failing to match the true value of resources and revenue lost.","The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the inadequacy and unfairness of colonial compensation practices in Africa. The General History of Africa provides detailed examples, such as the £150,000 compensation to the Niger Company and the £2,000,000 paid to the British South Africa Company for mining rights, which did not reflect the true value of the resources and revenue lost by local populations. It also highlights the repatriation of profits to shareholders abroad, leaving minimal benefits for Africans, and the colonial monetary policies that froze assets in metropolitan capitals. Additionally, the text notes the lack of substantial revenue from nationalized minerals, as seen in Sierra Leone, where mineral revenue constituted only 5% of total revenue in 1935. These examples illustrate the minimal economic benefits provided to African populations compared to the wealth extracted by colonial powers. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight dissatisfaction with compensation practices, such as the insufficient compensation for suffering families in Jamaica and the undervaluation of land acquired by Dr. Hall from the Greboes. The fixed annual payment of £500 to the Awujale of Jebu, perceived as inadequate compared to previous revenues, further exemplifies unfair compensation agreements. Criticism of the British colonial administration's financial management, including wasteful expenditure and inadequate salaries for officials, suggests systemic issues in valuing and compensating for resources and services. While the articles do not provide explicit examples directly related to resource loss, they support the notion of inadequate and unfair compensation practices in colonial Africa, aligning with the observations from the General History of Africa.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide several details that support the claim that colonial compensation practices in Africa were often inadequate and unfair. For instance, the text mentions the compensation of £150,000 to the Niger Company for its mining rights, which was a heavy price for the local population, and the £2,000,000 paid to the British South Africa Company for mining rights in the Rhodesias, indicating that the compensation did not reflect the true value of the resources and revenue lost by the local populations. Additionally, the text highlights the repatriation of profits from mining and other industries to shareholders abroad, leaving little benefit for the local African populations. The colonial monetary policies, which froze colonial assets in metropolitan capitals, further illustrate the inadequacy of compensation practices. Moreover, the text discusses the lack of substantial revenue from nationalized minerals in colonies like Sierra Leone, where direct revenue from minerals was only 5% of total revenue in 1935. These examples align with the claim by demonstrating that the compensation and economic benefits provided to African populations were minimal compared to the wealth extracted and repatriated by colonial powers.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that colonial compensation practices in Africa were often inadequate and unfair. For instance, the articles highlight the dissatisfaction with the compensation offered to suffering families in Jamaica, suggesting that the amount was insufficient and that the process of distinguishing between just and fraudulent claims was poorly managed. Similarly, the Greboes' contention that their land was undervalued and unfairly acquired by Dr. Hall reflects the inadequacy of compensation for resources. The articles also discuss the fixed annual payment of £500 to the Awujale of Jebu, which was perceived as insufficient compared to the revenue previously generated from levies, indicating a lack of fairness in compensation agreements. Furthermore, the criticism of the British colonial administration's financial management, including the wasteful expenditure and inadequate salaries for officials, suggests systemic issues in valuing and compensating for resources and services. These examples align with the claim by illustrating instances where compensation did not match the true value of resources and revenue lost.

But the limited nature of African participation should guide our assessment. Mining was established with foreign capital, and profits accruing from the industry were repatriated to swell the pockets of shareholders abroad, or to develop economies outside Africa. For instance, when the Charter of the Niger Company was revoked in 1899, the company was compensated £150000 for its mining rights in the region where tin mining was later established. According to the same agreement, the company was to receive as much as 50% of all royalties from mining for ninety-nine years.$^{59}$ This was a very heavy price for the local population to pay, but the situation was even worse in the Rhodesias, where mining rights remained in the hands of the British South Africa Company until 1933 when they were purchased by the state for £2 000 000.$^{60}$ But even after this change the local population was rarely regarded, and even more rarely treated, as the beneficiaries of mining operations. As late as 1942, a high-ranking official in the British Colonial Office shamelessly placed on record that 'there is particularly little reason for reserving the value of the mineral product to the local inhabitants when those inhabitants have done nothing to develop it'.$^{61}$ But even where the colonial administrations nationalized minerals, as was the case in Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, little revenue, mainly from royalties and income tax, was realized. In Sierra Leone direct revenue from minerals in 1935 was £34100, which was only 5% of total revenue. 62 Wages remained the only way by which the local population could have acquired a substantial portion of the proceeds from mining, but, as was the case in settler and plantation agriculture, they were kept so low that wage earners had to be subsidized by the peasant sector.

Equally guilty of overstatement are those colonial apologists, such as Gann, Duignan and Lloyd who see colonialism as an unqualified blessing for Africa as well as those like Perham and Fieldhouse who see the record as a balanced one. A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development. Finally, metro› politan industries benefited from cheap raw materials obtained from the colonies and profits made from the export of manufactured goods. When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

The tendency of West African merchant firms to monopolize through 'pools' is well known, and trading companies throughout the continent guarded their interests by refusing to compete in such a way as to raise prices. Indeed, intermediaries such as the 'Asians' in East Africa and the Lebanese in West Africa also set prices and conditions among themselves so that the African peasant had little choice when he went to make his sales. The cash-crop farmer faced the prospect of being gypped at the weighing scales, in the processing stage (as with the cotton ginnery), in transportation, in the calculation of returns and in the repayment of loans or advances where applicable. African producers were also making retail purchases from the middlemen traders and the commercial firms. A fundamental inequality marked the exchange between the colonial economy and the metropolises. This unequal exchange was reflected in the disparity between the low remuneration Africans received and the relatively high cost of manu› factured imports; and it also manifested itself in the low wage rate in the colonies as compared with the metropolises. Of course, unequal exchange was not a purely economic phenomenon. It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads.

Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'Anti-colonial movements in East Africa to 1914', 'content': ""and this failure did indeed make 'the passing of the old societies inevitable'. 49 On the whole, between 1890 and 1914 dramatic changes took place in East Africa.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

Most of the post-primary institutions were found in the main urban centres and in some countries most of the secondary schools were found in one town. In the Gold Coast for example about 80% of the secondary schools were found in Cape Coast. In Uganda, by 1920, there were 328 elementary schools in Buganda and only 34, 24 and practically none in the Western, Eastern and Northern provinces respectively.$^{37}$ Facilities for education were so inadequate and so unevenly distributed, because the colonial powers did not aim at pro› moting education for its own sake or for the sake of the Africans, but rather, to quote one African scholar, 'to produce Africans who would be more productive for the [colonial] system'. 38 Besides its grossly inadequate nature numerically and its uneven dis› tribution, the curricula provided by all these institutions were determined by the colonial rulers and were closely modelled on, if not carbon copies of, those of the metropolitan countries and therefore irrelevant to the needs of the continent. No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': ""It was neither a deliberate policy on the part of British colonial rulers which saved the land in British West Africa for the Africans during the inter-war period, nor was it because of the notorious reputation that West Africa had acquired as 'the White Man's Grave' by the late nineteenth century.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 370, 'article_title': 'Accra', 'full_section_title': 'Accra', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-8', 'issue_date': '23_06_1864', 'content': 'The Aungla chiefs sent answer to the Chief Civil Commandant to this effect: ""The man will not come; and besides, the money demanded as damages (between five and six hundred dollars) is not by any means sufficient; the thief must be made to pay more than that.

It seems that about 1833, a Dr. Hall, an American gentleman, was sent out by the Maryland Colonization Society, Baltimore, in the United States of America, to buy a portion of land for the coloured people of that State. That Society or State seems to want a settlement of its own coloured people, and not to mix them with other emigrants that went to Monrovia and elsewhere; hence they sent out Dr. Hall to buy a separate portion of land. Dr. Hall came to Cape Palmas, and bargained or arranged with the Greboes. King Freeman was then the king. The Greboes now contend that their sires only allowed the settlers whom Dr. Hall went to Monrovia and brought, twelve in number, to occupy a small piece of land from a place called Bigtown-hill to the point of the Cape where the Orphan Asylum is now standing—a distance of about half a mile. The Greboes then lived on Bigtown-hill, and had other towns in “Latrobe.” The Greboes stated that they cut the bush for the settlers and built their first house, for which Dr. Hall paid them what is found put down in the deed of sale for the land as bought, and that their fathers never sold the land. This is their story; the deed, however, states that Dr. Hall bought from a certain palm or cocoanut tree to a certain palm or cocoanut tree, so many miles, and one day’s walk or march into the Bush country. The Greboes again contend that their land does not extend over a good two hours’ walk into the Bush country, when they meet with other tribes who own that land—such tribes as the Warchekeh, Serrikeh, Barrikeh, the Persehbo, the Bolobo, and the Bororbo; this will be about the day’s walk. Now the Greboes say, how could they sell land that never was theirs; and contend strongly that Dr. Hall took advantage of their fathers, because they could neither read nor write; and those days being dark days, all of the kings and chiefs who made their marks in the deed of sale are dead. There are some old men living, who were youngsters at the time, who knew about the circumstances. The amount stated in the deed of sale, as far as I can learn, was three casks of tobacco, I suppose three forty or sixty or one hundred gallon casks filled up with tobacco; then two dozen beaver hats and other hats, some crockeries, cloths, &c., &c. The educated Greboes now contend that if even their fathers and grandfathers had sold the land, would it be reasonable to sell such a large portion of land for such a small amount of goods? but that they know their fathers did not sell the land. The Liberians, on the other hand, say we “know nothing about the matter. One thing we know, that the deed of sale was handed over to us by Dr. Hall as bought from you, with the marks of your sires attached to it; and according to the deed, we hold the land as ours. We,” say the Liberians, “are in occupation of the land, and the land you, the Greboes, are residing on is ours, only we permitted you to reside on it because we had no use for it at present.” In my estimation, the Liberians are right to hold on all land mentioned in the deed, and it is for the Greboes now to prove that the land has never been sold. Now I would say that the Greboes should not go to hostilities, but obtain a copy of the deed from President Payne, and write a letter to the Maryland State Colonization Society, enclosing the deed, and a letter to Dr. Hall, who is yet alive, and ask for an explanation. Heathenism cannot govern civilization. I must also inform you that whilst the settlers were living on the point of the Cape, and the Greboes on Bigtown-hill and Latrobe, and some of the settlers in Park’s-wood, Middlesex, Hants-street, Tubmantown, &c., the Greboes being heathen, would do heathenish tricks, women going perfectly naked in the presence of the settlers, which was horrible and disgraceful and shameful to their wives and daughters, and they would annoy the settlers in every way they could, by beating their children, refusing to let them pass through Bigtown-hill to go to the mission-school; and from one annoyance to another, refusing to allow the settlers to get water to drink, and cut fire-wood to cook with. It grew to a large amount of evil; and in 1857, in the late Governor Drayton’s time, the Liberians were obliged to fight even with the Cape Palmas Greboes, and drive them across the Hoffman River, where they are now residing, in Cape Palmas Town. The other Greboes, at the time, such as the Rocktown and Cavalla, assisted the settlers to fight against the Cape Palmas Town Greboes; but now they are united to fight against the Liberians. The Greboes occupy about thirty miles on the beach—viz., Fishtown, Rocktown, and Middletown, north-west of Cape Palmas; then Cape Palmas Town, divided by Hoffman River from Cape Palmas, the settlement of the Liberians. Then, leeward of this settlement, there are the Half Graway towns, three towns whose front faces the sea, and their backs on Shepherd’s Lake; then the Whole Graway towns, four in number, the same situation as the Half Graway towns. This Shepherd’s Lake is about six miles in length from Cape Palmas. One can get into his canoe and ride down to Whole Graway, six miles; then come the Cavalla towns, five in number, about three miles from Whole Graway; then the River Cavalla towns, three in number, on the Cavalla River, about five miles from Cavalla. This ends the Greboe tribes; their towns contain from 50 to 150 huts. My opinion is, either the fathers of these Greboes had sold Dr. Hall their land and other people’s, or Dr. Hall took advantage of them by writing down in the deed what they never sold him. Now Dr. Hall is alive, let them appeal to the Doctor for explanation and the Society; for, should they fight, the churches and schools at Hoffman Station, and the nice Christian village which the late Rev. C. C. Hoffman built, will all go to ruin by the shells, &c., of the Liberians, and the natives be driven back into the Bush by their neighbours, who will attack them also: I omitted to say that when this settlement was first founded it was a State and remained so a long time before they united with Monrovia.'}, {'id': 6201, 'article_title': 'Leader', 'full_section_title': 'Leader', 'last_edit_date': '04-01-1892', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1892#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_04_1892', 'content': 'few centuries.

F. Hutton said that for years past the Manchester Chamber of Commerce had been in correspondence with the Colonial Office in reference to the West Coast of Africa, and had constantly called attention to the neglect of the authorities to attend to the interests of our trade, and to the responsibilities that ought to be undertaken in connexion with it. This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position.

I come here, Frenchman very good man; he no kick poor black, rob, and call him dam nigger.""\n\nThere is no safety for personal property in Freetown, as the native police stand guard whilst their countrymen break into houses and stores. The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English. In the capital of Sierra Leone there are eighty-four salaried officials, whose aggregate pay amounts to £16,764 15s. 6d. per annum, or 6s. 8½d. per head of the population, plus 8s. 3½d. per head, the cost of six months\' leave of absence to England on full pay, with free passage out and back, for every year of service. This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

But it is of no less importance to economise and restrain expenditure. Unless this be constantly attended to, a deficit must always be expected. Colonel Ord's reports to the Government, printed for the use of the Parliamentary Committee, commented a great deal on the paucity of revenue at the Gambia, and its insufficiency to meet the current expenses; so that all hope of sanitary and other local improvements, and all hope of relief to the mother country from the pecuniary weight of that colony (which although so trifling, seemed to be thought almost insupportable, because it was African), would appear to be ridiculous. But the fact is, that Sierra Leone is not the only colony in which the public money has been wasted and squandered. A correspondent from the Gambia showed some time since the way in which an economy of from two to three thousand pounds a-year, which would almost, if not quite, cover any deficit, might be made without detriment to the public service. Now, again, our attention has been called to an annual item of expenditure which did not make its appearance at all in the estimates until the year 1862, and which, if not necessary up to that time, cannot have since been so. We allude to the item of fuel—fuel for the steamboat Dover, which ascends the river once a-month to McCarthy's Island. Up to 1862 wood was burnt on board the Dover, and its cost, we are told, was included in the 2,000l. a-year allowed for the expenses of that vessel. The Dover, it must be borne in mind, had been adapted for the consumption of wood for her engines instead of coal. But in the year 1862 it suited the interests or fancies of people in power at the Gambia and their merchant supporters, that coal—patent fuel from England—should be supplied thenceforward to the Dover instead of wood, as therefore. We can have no doubt that some very plausible case was made out for the Colonial-office in London, which, as the cost was not to come out of the English Exchequer, did not, we suppose, make any unhandsome objections. Coal—patent fuel—became therefore the order of the day; and a charge of 500l. appeared in the estimates of 1862 to defray the cost; or additional cost, we suppose, of that patent fuel. This of course raised the charge for the Dover to 2,500l., instead of 2,000l. But the 500l., we suppose, was found not to cover all the additional cost, or there were some extra voyages up the river in 1863, for the item fuel then appears in the estimates 655l. 11s. 4d., and again in the year 1864, 549l. 19s. 3d. Now can we wonder at a deficit in the Gambia chest, when this kind of thing is going on? From five to six hundred pounds a-year additional expenditure out of a gross revenue of some 16,000l. or 18,000l. a-year is no trifling matter. And in addition to this public wrong on the colony, there is also the private one of the loss to the natives who formerly cut and supplied the wood, which we do not think is at all compensated for by the profit derived by European merchants from the sale of the patent fuel. Since it has been determined that the African colonies are to pay their own expenses, they are entitled to expect that there shall be no wasteful outlay, the natives having no control over the expenditure."", 'last_edit_date': '1866-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1866#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some of the Difficulties in the Way of Extending Trade in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The gold-mining industry, which it was hoped a few years ago would have done much for the colony, has not succeeded as it deserved, and that from many causes.

These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

In 1891 and 1892 he was put to the expense of two journeys to England. Repairs to the factory and expense of removal and re-opening the trade had crippled him. His failure was also partially attributable to the excessive prices he paid for goods in stock when he purchased the business.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period.

Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': 'The combination of European capital with coerced African labour registered a sizeable surplus in products destined for European consump› tion and export.

Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Viewed from a somewhat different perspective, the unequal value of commodities exchanged reflects the fragile position of the region within the larger international trading system. As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The Portuguese, for example, exploited their role as suppliers of weapons to pressure the Chikunda bands to recognize Lisbon's limited authority over their territory.$^{62}$ Similarly, the Sena began to rely so heavily on their Arab allies that they jeopardized their sovereign status. 63 Even the powerful Bemba were not totally immune to pressures from Arab and Swahili traders. 64 Moreover, with the abolition of the slave trade, those classes or strata within them who profited from the trade - the aristocracy, merchants, warlords and landlords - searched desperately for new commodities such as wax, coffee, groundnuts, and vegetable oils which they could extract from their subordinates or acquire through commerce in order to ensure a constant supply of European consumer goods and weapons necessary to maintain their privileged position. In some regions this legitimate com› merce offered new opportunities for aspiring itinerant traders to accumulate capital and for the growth of peasant agriculture. To the extent that particular classes or strata successfully made this transition, they merely perpetuated or extended their dependent position in a world economy over which they had no control."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 435, 'article_title': 'Navigation of the River Niger', 'full_section_title': 'Navigation of the River Niger', 'last_edit_date': '08-23-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-21', 'issue_date': '23_08_1864', 'content': ""Now, the trade that we should look to would be trade in palm-oil, such as now exists—that is, within a certain distance of the sea-coast. But we should go higher up, and draw our supplies of palm-oil nearer the source. The present course of the trade is for the palm-oil to be sent down to the traders at the sea-coast, but we should probably go up, and should thus be able to get it at a lower rate.\n\nThen there is another article of produce which we should be able to obtain, I have no doubt in considerable quantities, in the upper country, called Shea butter, sample parcels of which, consisting of some ten or twenty tons at a time, were brought home by Mr. Laird's vessels and also by Mr. Jamieson's. It is a vegetable matter, used by the natives for food, and it will become, I believe, a very valuable article of import to this country. It is, as I have said, a sort of article we can expect to get in considerable quantities. It is a collection of the driblets of individual producers; every old wife will boil some of these nuts, skim off the oil, put it into a pot, and it is kept until it gets into casks and comes home. The development of this trade in Shea butter will, if we should succeed in carrying out our views, I am sure, astonish us all. I see no reason whatever why it should not follow the same course precisely as the trade in palm-oil. Now, the import of palm-oil in the year 1830 was only 10,000 tons; in 1840, it was 15,000 tons; in 1850, it was 21,000 tons; and in 1860 it was 40,000, or one million and a-half sterling. These are the results that I look for.\n\nBut it is perfectly well known that cotton is an indigenous plant in the countries to which we should penetrate; that it has been grown there for thousands of years probably, and it is manufactured into cloth, and dyed with indigo, which they also cultivate, and they dye this cloth in a manner which, I dare say, Mr. Samson will agree, would astonish the dyers of Manchester; and, besides this, there are other articles, which I need not enumerate, in which we might create a trade—in addition to the trade which we might look to create in the immediate neighbourhood—in the countries immediately bordering upon the Niger. I think, as I have already said, that we should at once establish a diversion of the trade from Tripoli, and that we should be able to supply the great markets in the interior, Kano and Sockatoo, and Borasu, and other towns which are said to vary from a hundred to a hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand inhabitants.""}, {'id': 2958, 'article_title': 'Liverpool Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Liverpool Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1875#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_10_1875', 'content': 'LIVERPOOL MARKETS.  \nAUGUST 28 TO SEPTEMBER 4.\n\nGINGER.—84 bags, African, at 43s.  \nINDIA-RUBBER.—10 tons, African, at 10½d. to 1s. 10d., according to quality.  \nEBONY.—15 tons at 11l. to 10l. 15s. per ton.  \nCAMWOOD.—7 tons at 34l. 15s. to 35l. per ton.  \nBARWOOD.—60 tons at 4l. to 4l. 2s. 6d. per ton.  \nPALM OIL is dearer; 750 tons sold; Irregular at 30l. to 31l., Bonny at 31l. 10s. to 31l. 12s. 6d., Benin at 32l. 5s. to 32l. 10s., New Calabar at 32l. 10s. to 32l. 12s. 6d., Old Calabar at 32l. 15s. to 33l., and Brass at 32l. 15s. per ton.  \nCOTTON.—Fair demand, but with large supplies prices barely supported.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared.

The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony. The value of the rubber exported is about £6,000 annually.

The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Rubber, palm kernels, palm oil, and benni seed (an oil-producing substance) constitute the bulk of the exports of Sierra Leone. The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

In this state it is called green ivory. It is not so white as the kinds called white ivory, which have been lying a longer time exposed to the heat of the sun until the animal matter has disappeared. The excellence of green ivory consists in its greater toughness and in its growing whiter by age, instead of yellow, as is the case with the whiter varieties.

The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860. Everywhere there was movement of labour either to concentrate it in places where it was needed or because some African peoples were regarded as better or more willing workers either because of their longer contact with a commercial economy or because of age-old features of their specific cultures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly.

The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': 'The general effect of these developments was to intensify the competition among the Europeans. Partly in response to the French forward policy, the British showed no less eagerness to consolidate and defend their positions. The discovery of diamonds in 1869-70 in Griqualand West in South Africa, and the prospects of finding gold in large quantities, began to raise the fever of competition and alter the basis of the relationship between Europeans in Africa and between them and the Africans. Various European activities, hitherto pursued seemingly for their own sake or for humanitarian purposes, began to be re-evaluated from the point of view of their contribution to various European national interests. Explorers were no longer expected merely to satisfy scientific curiosity but were also encouraged to gather strategic intelligence and trade secrets. Missionaries were not just individual servants of God obeying a divine call to evangelize but were regarded as organized national agents of acculturation, part of whose objective was to weaken the cultural and commercial exclusivity of their hosts. Traders were not just seeking profit, but were preparing the way for their own nations to establish control. Thus the widespread collaboration between Africans and Europeans, seemingly to utilize Euro› pean ideas and European technologies for nation-building in the rev› olutionary situation of the nineteenth century began to be seen as subversive, contributing directly to the systematic abortion of the efforts of African leaders to reform and modernize their societies.\nIn the same vein, African rulers generally viewed the activities of abolitionists as negative. In many cases, with the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, and after resisting and stalling, they began to co-operate to the extent that alternative trade in agricultural produce, gold, ivory and other commodities came to replace the slave trade and there was no interference with the holding of slaves and other sources of enforced labour. There was thus a basis for co-operation. As noted above, increased use of slaves was the basis of that co-operation. The Europeans recognized this, but in the 1870s, while not abandoning that position, began to use emancipation as a potential factor for weakening the economic base of African states.

If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them.

The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process.

Of course, the more they needed and the less they found, the more they became creative as the patois speech pattern of the previously French eastern Caribbean islands and the papiamento of the previously Dutch Antilles reveal. Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'. Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

I said to some of them: \'You are spending millions of money on a line in which it must be wasted. Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty. The enterprises in East Africa, both of Englishmen and Germans, are only commercial movements, not colonisation, and are not only liable to but will share the fate which has befallen all great European, secular or religious, movements in equatorial Africa.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery.

It is now nearly twelve months since Lagos was pointed out to us, as at one and the same time carrying on an extensive slave-trade, and recruiting the ranks of domestic slavery within the colony; unchecked, though we never can admit that it could have been unobserved, by the British authorities there; and until then not denounced, or publicly rebuked, either by Christian missionaries or the admitted and acknowledged members of their respective churches. The European missionaries, and the native pastors and teachers, all, we are bound to presume, deeply imbued with the principles and precepts inculcated by Him who preached the Sermon on the Mount, are not few in number; while the communicants in the churches may be counted by hundreds. How is it to be accounted for, that of this not inconsiderable body of British officials and missionaries, and native pastors, teachers, and communicants, not one, until our correspondent addressed us on the subject,—not one, we say, entered the lists against what they know to be as abominable in the eyes of British law, as it is repugnant to the spirit of that Christianity which they all profess? We can only account for it by what seems to be the fact, that as we have stated, the whole atmosphere of Africa is so tainted by the spirit of the slave-trade and of slavery, that to inhale it produces a moral and spiritual torpor, from which only an exceptionally vigorous and sensitive conscience can free itself. Under such circumstances, an independent and uncompromising public Press is manifestly a vital necessity for Africa, if the hope is to be indulged of her ever being reclaimed from that abyss of misery and degradation, of moral filth and spiritual loathsomeness into which she has been plunged, by the long-continued dominion within her of the most debasing superstitions and vices that ever fettered humanity. Regard it as they may in the vitiated atmosphere they breathe on the African Coast, and familiarized as they are with the abominable evil, so as to be perhaps unconscious of its ruinous tendencies, our African readers may rest assured that the material progress which is so important for them as regards their trading operations, depends in a very great degree on the extent to which freedom shall replace slavery. These readers of ours, we are told, comprise every African on the West Coast who has any pretension whatever to be classed as an educated man. We call upon them all to lay this truth seriously to heart. If they desire the development of the resources of the countries that supply the produce in which they trade, they should use all their influence, individually and collectively, against those gigantic paralyzers of human energies for purposes of good, the slave-trade and slavery. Their eye should not pity, their heart should not spare, any one among themselves whose covetousness, or other vile and debasing lusts, may lead him to dishonour the education that has been bestowed upon him, by buying or selling his fellow-creatures. The letters from Lagos and Cape Coast, to which we gave insertion in our August number, show, unhappily, how very necessary it is that we place these truths clearly and constantly before them, so long as God may grant us the energy and means to do so. The Hydra of African slavery must be killed. We have pledged ourselves to a war of extermination against it. Every educated man and woman on the West Coast ought to be active and energetic soldiers in our army. Thanks especially to the exertions of our noble missionary societies, there is now no inconsiderable number of educated women on the Coast; women, Christians too we hope in reality, as well as in profession, in addition to being educated. This great question of the total disappearance of slavery from among them; of that horribly debasing, degrading institution, under which members of their own sex may be purchased—victims in body and soul—ministers to lust and to every brutal passion, for a few pounds sterling, or dollars, or pieces of cloth, or bags of cowries—this question, we repeat, touches them nearly. The position that they and their educated female children may occupy; the greater or less consideration with which they will be regarded and treated, depends in no small degree, on the continuance or annihilation of female domestic slavery. They must—it is inevitable—they must be included, more or less, in the degradation that falls upon their human sisters. We call upon them to regard it as an accursed thing; as striking at the very root of that elevation of themselves in the community, to which their sex has attained in the Christian countries of Europe. We call upon them to look at it as the forbidden spoil in the tent of Achan, bringing a curse upon the whole community to which the culprit belongs. It is quite time that the educated women in Africa, particularly in the British settlements, where they are under the protection of British laws, should make their purifying influence felt in this vital matter. It is for them to cast a halo of purity and of Christian love around; to show in practice as in word, that they love their poorer sisters as themselves. It is only thus that there can be any hope of the purification of African society; any hope of that material as well as Christian advancement, which can alone raise Africa from the degraded position it holds in European opinion; a position owing in no small degree to that abominable slave-trade and slavery, which we call upon them to use their utmost efforts to eradicate.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'And now Portugal must—must put an end to the slave-trade from her East African possessions—or if she is unable to do so must be constrained to withdraw from the scene and allow some one else to do it for her.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa. They must not expect much from the people themselves.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Colonial states discriminated with regard to the types of force which they sanctioned in their colonies. Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'Anti-colonial movements in East Africa to 1914', 'content': ""and this failure did indeed make 'the passing of the old societies inevitable'. 49 On the whole, between 1890 and 1914 dramatic changes took place in East Africa.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops.

The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo.

But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

This developed new productive capacities that made slave labour less profitable and therefore produced new attitudes towards the slave trade.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': 'There is no need to exaggerate the role of external forces in African statebuilding.

If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them.

According to the present system the Colony must cover all its administrative expenses from the current receipts. These receipts consist, almost exclusively, in the duties levied at the coast. The income of the duty increases and decreases with the commerce in the Colony. German trade in Cameroons, however, is going backward, in consequence of the falling of prices for African products and of the trading monopoly of the tribes on the coast, which more than doubles, often quintuples, the price of the goods from the interior, thereby limiting the intercourse of the coast with the interior.

This limited power of the German administration does not reach beyond the coast. The armed force consists of a few black policemen in the gun-boat. But, like the Arabs in East Africa, the Dualla in Kamerun will not give up their predatory trade voluntarily; they will have to be forced to restrict themselves to legal commerce and to allow the Europeans to enter their commercial districts—the endeavour to force this, miscarried in East Africa on account of the lack of sufficient power, causing rebellion; a similar proceeding in Kamerun would also have similar consequences. If in East Africa half only of the means of power displayed later on would have been put into requisition at the beginning, a sedition would never have taken place; the Empire would have saved many millions, and the development of the Colony would have taken an undisturbed course. The predictions of the experts are similar now with respect to Kamerun. With relatively small protective forces the entire opposition of the Dualla could be broken. These protective forces would be sufficient to garrison a number of stations on the routes in the interior, facilitating to the German trade a safe pushing forward to the Hinterland. These 200 men could do as much service to the German trade in Kamerun as the 2,000 men of the protective forces in East Africa. It is said that the number of the latter is to be considerably decreased. If this opportunity be seized to transport part of them to Kamerun then the expenses of the new enrolment and equipment of the Kamerun troop would be saved, and we should have a victorious and well-trained troop entering into Kamerun.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC.\n\nLondon, England, Sept. 7, 1887.\n\n**Friends, Countrymen, in West Africa.**—Permit me to address a few lines to you through the columns of our tried friend, the _African Times_, upon the subject of the Liquor Traffic by Europe with Africa. It must be, by this time, evident to very many of us that this traffic inflicts a very serious and a very grievous injury upon our beloved Africa. It debases mind and body, it intensifies the miseries which chronic intertribal warfare and the slave trade, foreign and domestic, have everywhere produced; it blasts the progress of Christian missionary work, which is so very essential for the elevation of the continent; it hinders the growth of wholesome commerce, and fearfully oppresses it; and it threatens a speedy extinction of our race.\n\nThe desire and effort on the part of almost every nation in Europe to acquire or extend colonial possessions or protectorates in Africa, in order to promote an enlargement of the commercial operations of their children, means a fearful increase in the distribution everywhere of the beer and gin of Europe. The late Conference of European Powers at Berlin, taking advantage of the weakness of Africa and her inability to resist them, has given its authorization to the land scramble that has been going on, and has, by its refusal to restrict or suppress this criminal trade, left it free to run its wild, withering, and destructive course over the land. The vile character of the articles sold (a special preparation for the African market, and for which we give in return valuable products which contribute to promote wealth and comfort in Europe), the alarmingly great quantity that is steadily consumed, and the enormous profits from it to those who supply it, on account of which Europe is willing to pursue, in regard to Africa, the policy of killing the goose with the golden egg, and cares not whether or not she perishes from it, are, I presume, too well known to be insisted upon here.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""British Colonial Governments on the West Coast, and the Imperial Government, like those of other nations in Europe, protect and encourage the trade only on account of the very large revenue it yields, though there is no denying its evil effects.

F.

They had to complain very much of the apathy manifested by the resident officials of Her Majesty's Government, who taxed the goods, but declined to afford any protection or assistance to British merchants. Those officials seemed to have an idea that they were sent out to rule and not to assist as much as possible in the development of British trade. Owing to the state of affairs which had been allowed to arise in the localities indicated, the trade in this country had suffered a very marked decline, for whereas in 1884 we sent 106,000,000 yards of cotton goods, representing a value of £1,320,000, we only sent last year 73,000,000 yards, or a money value of £851,000. He submitted that the Government ought to take prompt measures to protect the lives and property of British subjects in West Africa, and so assist in extending a very valuable market for English manufactures. They had just heard that last May, on the invitation of the German Government, Her Majesty's Government gave to Germany an assurance that a Congo International Conference should be pledged to the British Protectorate in the Niger, that only moderate duties should be levied, and that those should only be levied for the purpose of paying the expenses necessary to carry out the obligations of the Protectorate. At the same time it was understood that there should be no monopolies there, and those concessions were made without giving those who were really owners of property in the territories any voice in the country whatever. Two of the special objects of the merchants in obtaining these concessions from the natives and in obtaining the treaties of sovereignty and territory were that we should do the very utmost we could to stop the importation of spirits into the districts. That trade had increased very considerably during the last few years, and it was one of the curses which European countries were introducing into uncivilized countries, and would tend to retard the progress of our trade and the progress of civilization in the interior of Africa. He thought it was a discredit almost to the Powers of Europe that when great and earnest endeavours were made to limit the import of spirits into these places, there was an almost unanimous opinion expressed against it except by England. Another object which these merchants had in making these treaties was that there should also be some limit put upon the importation of arms and gunpowder, which was another source of evil, and constantly causing wars and raids on our trade."", 'last_edit_date': '1886-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1886#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""An international agreement, based upon such ideas as the above, would form a basis from which the gradual suppression from the seaboard of this fearful trade might be made practicable.

The slave holders of the present day are either subjects of those Mahometan Governments which are by courtesy described as civilised, or they belong to the Mahometan tribes of uncivilised Africa, which also supply the slave hunters. Upon the Mahometan people a two-fold influence can be brought to bear. In the first place, the closing of the seas to the trade will put a stop to the supply of slaves; and secondly, the influence of civilised opinion may in time modify their traditional system. It is doubtful, however, whether the clearing of the seas will close all the markets of the slave hunters. In all probability there is a considerable demand in the region between the Nile, the Niger, and the Congo, which it is not possible for Europe to check under present circumstances.\n\nThe disappearance of slavery from the world implies as a precedent condition the reign of law in Africa. It implies the subjugation of the whole continent by European civilisation. There is no reason to take a gloomy view of the future, but there is also no wisdom in shutting our eyes to the nature of the issue involved. Mr. Buxton's resolution will be of immense service if it helps to expose the true nature of the recent attitude of Europe towards the peoples of the Dark Continent.

The recent scramble for Africa has done infinite harm. The flags of European nations have been floated over vast areas where there is no orderly administration of law; and the result has been to undo the work of a generation of heroes, and to bring back chaos where order was beginning.

As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives.

By that procedure they are debarred from giving the instructions to their staff at the Coast.

Whosoever shall collect, or become possessed of ivory in these territories, shall be liable to a license duty of 2 francs per kilogram, in addition to the export duty.\n\nArticle 2: In those parts of the Upper Congo, not comprised, as above, the license duty shall be 4 francs per kilogram.\n\nWith regard to this Decree, we desire to point out that the Legislature appears to be under the impression that ivory is an article which one had only to pick up. If such were the case, perhaps a duty of from 4 to 6 francs per kilogram, might not be so bad. Ivory has to be bought from the negroes, in exchange for merchandise, which has to be taken to the Upper Congo.\n\nBut the second paragraph dispels this illusion, as it states: ""Whosoever shall collect or become possessed of ivory in any way whatsoever."" Thus it is the trader who has to pay the duty of 2 to 4 francs per kilogram, over and above the export duty, upon an article which he has bought at great expense.\n\nThe duties are so exorbitant that it is doubtful whether it will be practicable to continue the ivory trade in the Upper Congo, especially if the present prices in Europe should not be maintained.\n\nPage 81 contains a Royal Decree signed March 25, 1890, when consequently the ""Anti-Slavery Conference"" in that city was still holding its sittings.

A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

The preservation of equal rights and complete freedom of commerce for the traders of all nations was the object aimed at by the British Government in the abortive negotiations with Portugal for the settlement of the Congo question. Wherever the British flag flies trade is free to all comers; French or German merchants have the same advantages as Englishmen, neither less nor more, throughout all our African possessions. As much cannot, however, be said for the dominions in that part of the world of any other European Power. France, in particular, is as exclusive in her commercial policy on the Senegal and the Gaboon as in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. British commerce seeks only a fair field and no favour, and if an international compact be possible, securing those conditions in all parts of the African continent, not yet occupied or controlled by any civilized State, we have no reason to dread the consequences or to shrink from an open competition—though not more open than that we freely concede to all under our undisputed rule—in which we are well able to hold our own.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1884#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

No one can read the account without seeing that the Conference has made an honest effort to deal in an effectual manner with the evil of slavery. The maritime measures to be adopted offered some difficulty, on account of the refusal of France to concede the right of search, but she displayed the greatest readiness to secure the end in view by other measures. A scheme was drawn up by the French plenipotentiaries and became the basis of the deliberations of the Maritime Committee. The measures to be adopted on land were more easily settled, though here the interference with slavery as a domestic institution involved some risk of wounding Turkish susceptibilities. But the purely domestic is the least objectionable form of slavery; the slave-trade is the thing to be attacked by civilised nations, who trust to the spread of Western ideas and the gradual substitution of contract to put an end to domestic slavery. The arrangements made by the Conference will greatly hasten this process; and meantime the slave-trade will be severely and effectually repressed. The whole of Africa will be brought under repressive regulations, which may be more firmly enforced in some districts than in others, but will nowhere be entirely neglected. Following the lines laid down by the Conference of Berlin, the Conference has taken a broad view of its mission. Regulation of the trade in strong drink and in firearms does not directly bear upon slavery, but it does intimately concern the protection and preservation of African races. In order to diminish the evils of indulgence in strong drink, the Conference has decided to forbid its importation into regions where it is at present unknown, and to discourage its use where a trade already exists, by imposing a duty. As the Congo Free State covers an enormous area, any attempt to check the import of strong drink while leaving open that channel for its distribution would be simply useless. But by its constitution the Congo Free State guarantees perfect freedom of trade throughout its territories. We are sorry to see that Holland takes its stand upon this clause in the international agreement by which the Congo State is regulated, and refuses to countenance any relaxation. Because it is feared that this refusal of the Dutch Government to co-operate with the other Powers may lead to the complete waste of the efforts made for the suppression of the slave-trade as well as of the liquor traffic. Meanwhile, it must be admitted on all hands that the Conference has done a great and important work in preparing the way for the peaceful development of the native races.

It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble', 'content': ""Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited.

'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Partly in response to the French forward policy, the British showed no less eagerness to consolidate and defend their positions. The discovery of diamonds in 1869-70 in Griqualand West in South Africa, and the prospects of finding gold in large quantities, began to raise the fever of competition and alter the basis of the relationship between Europeans in Africa and between them and the Africans. Various European activities, hitherto pursued seemingly for their own sake or for humanitarian purposes, began to be re-evaluated from the point of view of their contribution to various European national interests. Explorers were no longer expected merely to satisfy scientific curiosity but were also encouraged to gather strategic intelligence and trade secrets. Missionaries were not just individual servants of God obeying a divine call to evangelize but were regarded as organized national agents of acculturation, part of whose objective was to weaken the cultural and commercial exclusivity of their hosts. Traders were not just seeking profit, but were preparing the way for their own nations to establish control. Thus the widespread collaboration between Africans and Europeans, seemingly to utilize Euro› pean ideas and European technologies for nation-building in the rev› olutionary situation of the nineteenth century began to be seen as subversive, contributing directly to the systematic abortion of the efforts of African leaders to reform and modernize their societies.\nIn the same vein, African rulers generally viewed the activities of abolitionists as negative. In many cases, with the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, and after resisting and stalling, they began to co-operate to the extent that alternative trade in agricultural produce, gold, ivory and other commodities came to replace the slave trade and there was no interference with the holding of slaves and other sources of enforced labour. There was thus a basis for co-operation. As noted above, increased use of slaves was the basis of that co-operation. The Europeans recognized this, but in the 1870s, while not abandoning that position, began to use emancipation as a potential factor for weakening the economic base of African states. It should be specifically noted in this connection that most of the armies the Europeans were raising were manned by emancipated African slaves loyal to their redeemers, who armed and commanded them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

The lesser powers, with no great prestige at stake, managed to get on without any new imperialism, though Portugal and Holland displayed a revived pride in the empires they already possessed and the latter's was administered with renewed vigor. 1S Hayes concludes therefore that 'the new imperialism' was basically 'a nationalistic phenomenon' and that its proponents hankered after national prestige. European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

Holland Rose, by 'a state of political equilibrium which made for peace and stagnation in Europe',$^{58}$ the same period in Africa was marked by inter-state and intra-state conflict and rivalry - the Mandingo against the Tukulor, the Asante against the Fante, the Baganda against the Banyoro, the Batoro against the Banyoro, the Mashona against the Ndebele, etc. Thus, while Europe could focus her attention militarily almost exclusively on her imperial activities overseas without any distraction at home, African states and countries had their attention divided. Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Global strategy', 'content': 'There is a third school which maintains that the European interest in Africa which gave rise to the Scramble was a matter of global strategy, not economics. The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Evangelical Christianity', 'content': ""Evangelical Christianity, in whose eyes the Origin of Species was damnable heresy, had no qualms, nevertheless, in accepting its racial implications.

Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': ""The final and easily the most decisive factor was, of course, the over› whelming logistic and military superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa. While Europe was using professional and well-drilled armies, very few African states had established standing armies and fewer still had pro› fessional armies. Most African states recruited and mobilized individuals on an ad hoc basis for either defence or offence. Besides, in addition to their own armies, the European powers could always, as A. Isaacman and J. Vansina have contended, rely on African mercenaries and levies which gave them the numerical superiority they needed.$^{61}$ In fact, as A. Laroui puts it, most of the armies were African in recruitment and only European in command. Above all, by the terms of the Brussels Convention of 1890, the imperial powers agreed not to sell arms to Africans. This meant that most African armies were armed with completely outmoded, old and often unserviceable guns, mainly flint-locks or muzzle-loading muskets, and had plates 2.2(a)-(f) Weapons used by Africans and their European opponents during the wars between 1880 and 1935 (for Plate 2.2(f) see next page) no heavy artillery or naval power whatsoever. The European armies, on the other hand, were armed with the most up-to-date heavy artillery, and guns such as the repeater rifle, and above all the Gatling and the Maxim guns. They also used the heavy artillery of naval forces. As Laroui has pointed out, even motor vehicles and aeroplanes62 were used in the later campaigns. It is significant that the two African leaders who were able to inflict some defeats on the Europeans, Samori and Menelik, managed to obtain some of these up-to-date weapons. But in the end even Samori too was overpowered by the French. The overwhelming superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa is summed up succinctly in Hilaire Belloc's famous couplet already quoted in Chapter 1.\nIn view of these economic, political and above all military and techno¬ logical advantages enjoyed by European powers over African polities, the contest was a most uneven one and it is not at all surprising that the former could vanquish the latter with such relative ease.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade.

She has passed rapidly, though it may seem to have been slowly, through the earlier stages of her elevation. The epoch of more potent effort has now arrived. Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it. Just as powerful European organizations prosecuted the slave-trade in Africa which individual cupidity desultorily commenced, and thus gave to that accursed traffic the enormous development to which it attained, so will powerful European organizations now take the field in giving development to that legitimate commerce for which Africa possesses so many rich and copious elements. A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array. Companies with too restricted capital can only do the same sort of work that individual merchants have been and are performing.

The advance of religion, of civilization, and of commerce were all involved in the opening up of Central Africa, and it was on that account that they appealed to that meeting, and to the greater public beyond, to take into serious consideration how much had been done in that direction in the last twenty-five years, and how great was the promised harvest if they joined in the great movement which was now going on. He moved, ""That the commercial interests of this country are to a large extent involved in the development of intercourse and legitimate trade with the outports to the fertile but little known regions of Central Africa; and, therefore, that the scheme of thorough exploration proposed by the African Exploration Fund Committee deserves the warmest support of this meeting, as powerfully tending to secure that end.""\n\nCaptain CAMERON seconded the motion. He said Africa was the most fertile country in the world. They had heard of the Spice Islands, but here was a spice continent. In Africa there was a great deal more produce than the people could possibly consume. As an illustration of how a trade might grow, he might mention that in 1875 the exports of India-rubber were of the value of 40,000l., in 1876 100,000l., and this year it was expected they would be 250,000l. The great difficulty was the means of communication, but all difficulties might be removed by systematic exploration, and the establishment of stations. The slave-trade was more horrid in its effects than any one who had not witnessed them could conceive. He had known whole villages destroyed, and 500 or 600 people driven into the jungle to perish of starvation or be destroyed by wild beasts, in order to procure 50 or 60 slaves. The slave-trade might be put down by opening up roads and systematic exploration, but it would require a long time to induce the people to abolish domestic slavery, which was so rooted in their habits that if a slave were freed to-day he would complain to-morrow if he were not allowed to have a slave of his own.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence.

Still, it was a lost continent, banished, as it were, from commercial intercourse with the civilized parts of the world. The most considerable part of our commerce with North Central Africa was carried across the Great Desert of Sahara from the shores of the Mediterranean. Caravans now performed dangerous and tedious journeys of many months' duration from Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis, and other ports to the kingdom of Soudan. Two thousand miles of sterile and mountainous country had to be traversed and hostile tribes encountered before the nearest market was reached. In spite of those difficulties, about three millions worth of British produce found its way annually from the North to Soudan, which kingdom had no less than twenty millions of inhabitants. The great importance of opening those regions to commerce could not for a moment be doubted, and Timbuctoo formed, he thought, the most favoured spot for such intercourse, situated as it was on the very edge of the Desert. His plan was to open a direct commercial highway from the mouth of the river Belta, in the neighbourhood of Capes Juby and Bogador, on the North-west Coast of Africa, opposite the Canary Islands, to the northern bend of the Niger, at Timbuctoo—a distance of about 800 miles. That would form the shortest route to the interior, and was within easy access of Europe and America, the mouth of the Belta being distant about 1,500 miles from England. The engineering difficulties were inconsiderable, since the physical formation of that part of the Desert of Sahara which had to be crossed favoured the project; a great tract of it, with an area of 126,000 square miles, and known as Eljuf, being a vast depression, considerably below the level of the Atlantic. It was bounded by fertile and populous regions, and inhabited by an industrious class of people, whose only commercial intercourse with Europe was carried on from Mogador. That depression was impregnated with salt, and it had, it was believed, formerly formed part of the bed of the sea. He contended that the climate, the geography, and the people were all favourable to the scheme, and if once the mouth of the Belta was cleared of sand, the waters of the Atlantic would fill their former bed; thus establishing a direct communication with North Central Africa within easy distance of our ports. Instead of a trade of three millions annually, it might be increased tenfold. The great continent of Africa would be opened to every wholesome influence, its vast resources would be developed, and the horrors of the slave-trade would no longer stain its history. He added that the proposed preliminary survey would enable them to obtain the necessary data to carry out the scheme, and that such survey would be comparatively inexpensive."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Bright Prospects for Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have been long engaged in sounding in deaf or reluctant ears the great resources of that poor Africa which has been made and kept poor only by the demand for her crop of human beings to cultivate as slaves the soil of transatlantic lands, which, however rich they may be, cannot surpass her own.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

He says: ""Yesterday the caravan of the French Expedition, with flags flying and music playing, entered Kouikouron, the capital of Unyanyembe. The most sympathetic reception was given to us by the thousands of negroes who gathered round us.

This absence of information on the Volta River coal discovery suggests that the textbook does not address this specific instance of potential economic exploitation.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

But the limited nature of African participation should guide our assessment. Mining was established with foreign capital, and profits accruing from the industry were repatriated to swell the pockets of shareholders abroad, or to develop economies outside Africa. For instance, when the Charter of the Niger Company was revoked in 1899, the company was compensated £150000 for its mining rights in the region where tin mining was later established. According to the same agreement, the company was to receive as much as 50% of all royalties from mining for ninety-nine years.$^{59}$ This was a very heavy price for the local population to pay, but the situation was even worse in the Rhodesias, where mining rights remained in the hands of the British South Africa Company until 1933 when they were purchased by the state for £2 000 000.$^{60}$ But even after this change the local population was rarely regarded, and even more rarely treated, as the beneficiaries of mining operations. As late as 1942, a high-ranking official in the British Colonial Office shamelessly placed on record that 'there is particularly little reason for reserving the value of the mineral product to the local inhabitants when those inhabitants have done nothing to develop it'.$^{61}$ But even where the colonial administrations nationalized minerals, as was the case in Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, little revenue, mainly from royalties and income tax, was realized. In Sierra Leone direct revenue from minerals in 1935 was £34100, which was only 5% of total revenue. 62 Wages remained the only way by which the local population could have acquired a substantial portion of the proceeds from mining, but, as was the case in settler and plantation agriculture, they were kept so low that wage earners had to be subsidized by the peasant sector. Racial discrimina› tion was an important guiding line in this issue.$^{63}$ European employees were paid many times the amount paid to African employees, even for similar tasks. Africans were rarely taught important skills which would increase their productivity and, subsequently, their incomes.

Partly in response to the French forward policy, the British showed no less eagerness to consolidate and defend their positions. The discovery of diamonds in 1869-70 in Griqualand West in South Africa, and the prospects of finding gold in large quantities, began to raise the fever of competition and alter the basis of the relationship between Europeans in Africa and between them and the Africans. Various European activities, hitherto pursued seemingly for their own sake or for humanitarian purposes, began to be re-evaluated from the point of view of their contribution to various European national interests. Explorers were no longer expected merely to satisfy scientific curiosity but were also encouraged to gather strategic intelligence and trade secrets. Missionaries were not just individual servants of God obeying a divine call to evangelize but were regarded as organized national agents of acculturation, part of whose objective was to weaken the cultural and commercial exclusivity of their hosts. Traders were not just seeking profit, but were preparing the way for their own nations to establish control. Thus the widespread collaboration between Africans and Europeans, seemingly to utilize Euro› pean ideas and European technologies for nation-building in the rev› olutionary situation of the nineteenth century began to be seen as subversive, contributing directly to the systematic abortion of the efforts of African leaders to reform and modernize their societies.\nIn the same vein, African rulers generally viewed the activities of abolitionists as negative. In many cases, with the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, and after resisting and stalling, they began to co-operate to the extent that alternative trade in agricultural produce, gold, ivory and other commodities came to replace the slave trade and there was no interference with the holding of slaves and other sources of enforced labour. There was thus a basis for co-operation. As noted above, increased use of slaves was the basis of that co-operation. The Europeans recognized this, but in the 1870s, while not abandoning that position, began to use emancipation as a potential factor for weakening the economic base of African states.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure.

Central Africa, with its low population density, was the arena for concession companies, infamous for forced labour. Such settled agriculture as was developed in Central Africa, continued with coercion over a rural proletariat, as on the sugar, sisal and cotton plantations of Mozambique and Angola, or it became capital-intensive, as in the Belgian Congo. It was possible for Lever Brothers to set up oil palm plantations in the Belgian Congo from 1911. Their requests to have similar concessions in British West Africa were turned down, because the colonial administration correctly perceived that such a venture would necessitate the violent subjugation of thousands of inhabitants. Besides, the colonialists had early proof in West Africa of the success and viability of the African peasantry in producing an exportable surplus and lucrative returns to the European trading community. French persistence with settler agriculture in West Africa demonstrated its inferiority vis-à-vis African small-scale production. In East Africa, Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia, the settler economy had to be subsidized and protected from African competition by legislation, without which it could not have secured enough labour.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

Since that time counsel had advised that the technical objection was not worth much, but in order to place the matter beyond doubt the omission which led to the objection had been rectified, the omission being that the Company intended to proceed with the liquidation under the Companies' Act, 1862. In accordance with the usual practice he desired to place before the shareholders the latest news which had been received—news which, he was sorry to say, would be very little, for no letter had been received from the mine since the last meeting of the Company. A few days ago, through the courtesy of a French company, the directors received a copy of a despatch which had been sent by Governor Griffith to Lord Knutsford, the Colonial Secretary, which stated the result of his interviews with the managers of the mines at the Gold Coast, and the measures which he proposed to adopt. Governor Griffith expected to complete the telegraph to Axim by the end of the year, and he had taken measures to proceed with the tramway from Axim to the mouth of the river, which would save dangerous navigation from Axim over the bar. Another important piece of news...\n**99**\n\nwas, he feared, too good to be true. A letter from a shareholder stated that the writer had seen a gentleman who had just arrived from the coast with the news that coal had been discovered twenty-six miles from the Company's property. If such were the case it would be a salvation to the Company. He (the Chairman) had always been a great believer in the riches of the Gold Coast, and it was clear that if the gold had been obtained at a depth at the tops of the hills of only 80 to 100 feet, there must be plenty of the metal left. The report of the committee of shareholders was now in the hands of the proprietors, and he supposed they would conclude it was a pity to sacrifice their property. The Board agreed to alterations which the committee suggested should be made in the reconstruction scheme; and it now remained for the shareholders to say whether they would accept it or not.\n\nMr. Fergusson supported the scheme, and suggested that the Board should not proceed to allotment until applications for at least 80,000 shares had been received.\n\nA motion that the Company be wound up voluntarily under the provisions of the Companies' Acts, 1862 to 1867, was carried.""}]","[{'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship.

Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry.

A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern.

The discovery of the source of the Nile has been rapidly followed by the establishment of a company for developing the rich resources of the country through which that river flows, from Khartoum to Cairo; and also as far as Taka, on the frontiers of Abyssinia. It would be difficult to over-estimate the importance of this great effort. The Egyptian Commercial and Trading Company, founded, and to be principally conducted by, mercantile houses having establishments in Egypt, commands and receives our warmest sympathies. We can have no doubt of the natural riches of the country through which the Nile brings down the waters of Lake Nyanzas from the equatorial districts of Africa. All that we have ever felt to be wanting there, was the discontinuance of those atrocious slave-hunts which depopulated and devastated some of the naturally most luxuriant and productive tracts in the world, and the establishment of regular trading stations for the exchange of European manufactures against the cotton, coffee, sugar, rice, tobacco, gums, oils, ivory, senna, beeswax, ostrich-feathers, gold-dust, silk, indigo, &c., abounding there. This will now be accomplished. The Government slave-hunts from Egypt have been discontinued, and we feel that no slave-hunts whatever will be tolerated by a company that has its principal seat of direction in London. To collect the products of the soil and of the chase will give ample employment and rich reward to the populations, which the atrocious slave-trade has not succeeded in annihilating. We have no doubt whatever—there can be no reasonable doubt—that a new great cotton field is about to be thus opened. The Nile and the Niger will ere long pour rich treasures of cotton into the famished mills of Manchester. Of the latent wealth of the Niger districts as regards this important staple, Dr. Baikie's reports to the British Government furnish ample proof.

Even now our knowledge of them is very imperfect, their thorough exploration being impeded by climatic and physiographic influences. In a country, of which the greater part of the surface consists of swamps overgrown with mangrove forests, and which is rendered impenetrable by the luxuriance of the vegetation, geological and geographical studies are rendered all but impossible, whilst the absence of mountains prevents the traveller from obtaining a clear idea of the general configuration. The surface of the country presents a series of flat swampy plains, copiously watered by rivers and streams, and intersected by chains of hills gradually increasing in elevation as we recede from the sea-coast towards the interior, the said chains of hills being, very roughly, parallel to the average trend of the coast. Having regard to the large annual rainfall (about 60 in.), to the exceeding softness of the rocks, and the great sinuosities of the river, as well as to the general surface contour, no geologist can doubt that we have here a well marked example of a low plateau, from which hills have been produced simply by subaerial denudation, the harder portions having resisted the influence of the aqueous action which has worn the softer parts into hollows and valleys. In many cases, the hills owe their existence to a quartz reef which they enclose, and which has formed the backbone of the hill; a confirmation of this theory may be found in the fact that the northern slope of the hills is usually far steeper than the southern, the enclosed reef dipping to the south. The country rock is in most cases a non-stratified and but slightly indurated clay rock, resting upon soft blue slates, at times schistose; but in the present imperfect state of our geological knowledge of this region this statement must be regarded as conjectural rather than conclusive. The writer has never himself seen a single fossil that might aid in fixing the geological epoch of this formation, nor has he ever heard of such having been found, and is disposed to regard it as modern, geologically speaking. Round the bases of these low hillocks, and covering some of the more elevated plains, are deposits of non-consolidated gravels which are occasionally auriferous. These have been and are worked by the natives, especially on the banks of the smaller streams, tributaries of the river Ancobra, which intersects and forms the main highway of communication between the various gold mining concessions and the coast. Hitherto, none of these auriferous deposits have been found sufficiently rich to repay the attention which various European explorers have directed towards them, though there is no reason why such should not be discovered, especially towards the interior. The main wealth of the region lies in its deposits of gold quartz, which have been and are now worked by various mining companies.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products.

How rapid has been his progress on this important river is evidenced by the fact that in seven months he has performed the journey from London to Sokoto and back; three of these months were passed on the ocean. During that time Mr. Thomson succeeded in accomplishing the important mission with which he was intrusted. With the Sultans of Gando and Sokoto he has made treaties which give the company command of the Niger up almost to Timbuctoo, and of the Binue, its great tributary, to the limits of navigation. The company are at liberty to trade over all the dominions of these potentates, and treaties have been drawn out with such exactitude that neither the Sultans nor any European rivals can misunderstand them. Indeed, it is stated that Herr Flegel, who followed Mr. Thomson on the Binue on behalf of a German company, has been summarily turned out of the river.

It is believed that the Greeks received gold from these parts 2,900 years ago. Of recent times our first African traveller, Mungo Park, proved the existence of gold north of the Kong Mountain, and described the methods by which gold was won by the Natives; a plan similar to that adopted by the Natives south of the same range. The present gold supply comes from Ashanti, and possibly the bulk of it from Wassau. A little over 40 years ago our principal supply came from the Gold Coast; but when California and Australia came to the front as gold producers, the Gold Coast was to a great extent lost sight of. Since the first supply of gold in 1471, the total amount received from West Africa has been estimated by Captain Burton at £600,000,000, an amount not in the least exaggerated, I should say, when we take into account the regular yearly returns made for a period exceeding 200 years. Other authorities estimate that in the space of 40 years no less an amount than £200,000,000 could have been received. The surface soil in some parts of the country seems to be full of gold; it has been found on the sea beach, in rivers, and even washed from the gutters of the streets of the small towns after rain. Rich mines are found in Gaman and Wassau, the principal gold fields being on the Wassau range. Expeditions have been made from time to time, and quite recently discoveries are reported from the north-west part of the Colony. Such work is slow; the country is covered with dense forest, which makes progress in travelling and surface examinations difficult. As there is traditionally great wealth in the Kong mountains, it would seem wise to construct a line of rails through the country with the object of tapping this region.

Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom.

The main stream is formed, so far as is known at present, of three main branches: (1) the Lualaba, which some regard as the principal, and which comes from the south-west, forming on the map a chain of lakelets, of which only two have been seen—by Cameron and Reichard; (2) the Luapula, of which the Chambesi is the upper course, and which traverses Lakes Bangweolo and Moero, discovered by Livingstone; (3) the Lukuga, which issues from Lake Tanganyika and flows direct westwards. According to information obtained from natives and Arab traders, these three rivers unite at a common centre, where the waters form a large lake, known as Lanji, which no white traveller has seen. The country of Urua, on the west of Tanganyika, into which the expedition will penetrate, has just been touched by one or two explorers. Among them are Capello and Ivens, Reichard and Arnot, all of whom speak in glowing terms of the fertility of the region, of its salubrity, and its richness in minerals. It lies so high and is so cold sometimes as almost to freeze. It is a region on which it is desirable to have full information, in the interests of both commerce and geography. It has been stated that Mr. Stanley is likely in the future to undertake a special mission to the Upper Congo. However that may be, it is to be hoped that the Congo Company will carry out their intentions; there is plenty of room here for several expeditions. The proposed expedition will be under the command of M. Alexandre Delcommune, who has already done good work in exploring some of the Congo tributaries, and has been seventeen years on the river. He will be accompanied by Lieut. Hackanson, of the Swedish army, formerly one of the agents of the Congo Free State; Dr. Briart; Lieut. Santsschoff, formerly of the Russian army; Baron Marcel de Roert; M. Norbert Didderich, an engineer; and M. Protsch. MM. Hackanson, Briart, and Santsschoff have already sailed; M. Delcommune leaves on July 6; and M. Didderich on the 3rd. The escort will consist of 150 native soldiers. The expedition will meet at Kiachassa about the middle of September, and embarking on the steamer Roi des Belges, will proceed by the Upper Congo and its tributary, the Lomami, to the limit of navigation on the latter river, nearly opposite Nyangwé. Thence the expedition will proceed on foot. It will be absent from twelve to eighteen months.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CONGO RAILWAY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Such are some of the favourable aspects in which the scheme of a Congo railway is presented in this report. On these grounds investors are invited to put their money into it as a concern that is sure to pay; while philanthropists, those interested in missions, in the abolition of slavery, and the development of Africa are urged to contribute. On the benevolent basis there can be no objection to the proposed railway. That it would be for the good of Central Africa, and especially of the Congo Free State, we cannot doubt. That it could be constructed by native labour under proper superintendence is also quite possible. At all events, European labour is out of the question. But no good can come of cherishing delusions on the subject. Whatever may be the case with the interior highlands and the region far south to the Garenganze country (which has nothing to do with the railway), unhealthy is the only term that can characterise the climate of the Congo Valley and the country for many miles on each side. The report makes strenuous efforts to prove that even along the line of the railway is a large population and a considerable traffic awaiting development; but, taking their own figures, the population is scanty, and the products do not hold out much prospect of local traffic. As to the actual trade of the Congo, for the year 1888 the total value of the exports that came down the river from all directions amounted to over 7,000,000f., of which 2,500,000 represented the produce of the Free State. At the utmost the imports are valued at the same amount—that is to say, at the present time £600,000 represents the total traffic.\n\nof the Congo region, and much of that would not be carried by the railway at all. It is hinted in the report that indications of minerals have been found in the territories of the State; but one who had for some years ample opportunity of becoming acquainted with the character of the region does not believe that minerals exist in paying quantities beyond the southern border. Copper and iron are no doubt found, but that it would ever pay to work them for export is in the highest degree doubtful.\n\nVarious other questions are discussed in this interesting report—questions as to the natives, as to labour, as to native laws, &c.; but everything is presented in the most optimistic fashion. By all means let the railway be constructed if the funds can be obtained; but let it be borne in mind that a railway in such a region must be based at first, and for many years, on pure benevolence. And in a general way let it not be forgotten that tropical Africa is an exception to almost any other region on the globe, and that its development and civilisation must be accomplished by special methods. With regard to the general question of the future of the Congo Free State, it need not be discussed at present; it is a subject that, however, must be faced in the near future. — *Times.*', 'last_edit_date': '1889-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1889#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of the Congo State', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Some interesting particulars of affairs on the Congo have been lately published, showing that, with the development of commerce on the great river, slavery is fast dying out. Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered. The river, the Lomami by name, was found easily navigable and with a good depth. The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town. The communication between Niangwe and Stanley Falls by the Congo is almost impossible, owing to the many falls and rapids; and the Lomami will form a further means of extending protection and bringing civilisation to regions which have suffered much from the Arab raids for slaves."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: The Price of Palm Oil—The Congo Free State—A Correction', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'TO THE EDITOR OF “THE AFRICAN TIMES.”*\n\nLiverpool, Feb. 20, 1886.\n\nSIR,—I think you will be doing a service to your friends in Africa by drawing their attention to the position of the great African produce—Palm Oil.

At the present time the stock unsold by importers in Liverpool, Havre, and Hamburg cannot be less than 10,000 tons.

With such a stock, it is suicidal on the part of shippers to send any oil at all to Europe, unless sold to arrive at current prices; or it must inevitably be slaughtered. If there be a continuance of heavy shipments, as have ruled recently, we shall see oil down to £15 per ton.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.741, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': ""In Kenya and Central Africa, as was the case in Tanganyika under the Germans, Africans owned some land, but substantial portions of the most fertile arable land were alienated for European settlers. The process of land alienation and its political and economic repercussions in Kenya and Southern Rhodesia have been well documented by M. P. K. Sorrenson 3 and Giovanni Arrighi.$^{4}$ It has been argued that British perception of economic activity in Kenya at the beginning of the twentieth century led them to look for economic agents from outside. Contrary to welldeveloped peasant agriculture found in Uganda (especially in Buganda) under the control of centralized political institutions, the argument goes, the economies of most communities in Kenya were too backward to be relied upon as a springboard for economic growth. Consequently, the argument concludes, white settlers were chosen to form the base of economic life of the dependency.$^{5}$ This line of thought offers only part, and the lesser part, of the explanation. There were many parts of the British Empire where indigenous economies were miserably undeveloped. The coastal regions of Kenya are a case in point. The fact that these regions were spared from settler colonization clearly indicates that the Kenya Highlands had something special to offer for European settlement. Evidently it was the temperate climate above other factors, which attracted the white settlers. The land occupied by settlers was mostly over 1400 m above sea level. Such areas were among those with the highest and most reliable levels of precipitation. In short, the alienated land was situated in the most favourable agricultural zones.\nThe beginning of land alienation in East Africa was discussed in Chapter 7. It took a dramatic trend especially in Kenya after 1909 and was carried out at give-away prices. In 1903 only about 2000 ha had been alienated to Europeans in Kenya. By 1914 the area alienated had risen to about 260000 ha and to about 2740000 ha in 1930.$^{6}$ This was a very substantial chunk of the arable land, bearing in mind the fact that the Kenya Highlands (about 90000 sq km) comprised less than 15% of Kenya's area and yet supported over 75% of the total population of the country until the 1930s.

Neither the British government nor the mining monopolies which emerged from the 1870s had any intention of leaving mineral resources under the control of the Boers or of allowing priority to settler agricultural concerns with arable land, water, pasture and cattle, when the subsoil and African labour promised huge surpluses exportable to the metropolises. Boer social formations combined elements of the slave plantation, the feudal fief and the patriarchal community, in addition to capitalist commodity relations. After the Kimberley diamond finds (1870) and particularly after the Witwatersrand gold strike (1886), the bourgeoisie was determined to impose hegemony over all pre-capitalist social formations in South Africa, irrespective of race. The Anglo-Boer wars (1899-1902) were also antiimperialist resistances, albeit in a perverse sense, since at the same time they sought the further entrenchment of settler colonialism.

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

It was resisted in arms, and much of the support given to the great revolts of the early twentieth century which tried to redefine sovereignty came from men who hated forced labour.

Nowhere did the 'European sector' develop so rapidly, dwarfing the 'traditional' African economy. This economic pattern and the complexity of ethnic stratification are attributable to the ways in which colonization proceeded, which in turn was determined by the natural conditions and the vast natural wealth of that part of Africa.\nBy 1919 the historical tenor of economic life in most of Southern Africa had been upset to a greater degree than in other parts of the continent. Millions of people had been drawn into the sphere of capitalist exploitation. By the middle of the 1920s more than 200000 migrant workers, recruited from as far away as Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, were employed in the South African mines.$^{2}$ Upwards of 60000 labourers worked in the copper, tin, diamond and gold mines of the Congo. 3\nBecause of the development of European farming and large-scale expropriation of land from the peasants in a number of Southern African countries, African participation in the production of export crops and in trade was thwarted except in sectors of forced production such as cotton in the Congo.$^{4}$ Similarly, the road was barred to the emergence of a large stratum of African capitalist farmers and merchants, which is a feature of many other colonies where there were much fewer white settlers.

Its more advanced contingents were represented by workers in the industrial cities and ports. Most of the African labour in mining and in the cities was initially recruited from seasonal workers. Yet an increasing number of people came to depend on the seasonal occupation for their livelihood, and, over time, a process of labour stabilization occurred. As a result, the emergence of an African urban proletariat was more advanced there than in most parts of West and East Africa.

By 1912 only five owners together held 20% of all land alienated to Europeans. At one time over 50% of all alienated land in the most fertile parts of the Rift Valley was owned by two syndicates and four individuals. It was also in this area that speculation went out of proportion. Farms which sold for half a shilling per acre in 1908 were resold for ten shillings per acre in 1912. Two years later the same land changed hands on the market at twenty shillings per acre. 11 In Southern Rhodesia an even greater proportion of land was alienated to Europeans. Between 1890 and 1900 European entrepreneurs and adven› turers poured into the country expecting to find a 'Second Rand', which was nowhere to be found. Only small and scattered mineral deposits were discovered. Many of the Europeans bought land from the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which ruled by Charter on behalf of the British Crown, and settled in Mashonaland as farmers. Then in 1894 each member of the Victoria and Salisbury columns recruited to crush the Ndebele was promised 6000 acres of farm land. Land alienation was extended to Matabeleland. Unlike the situation in Kenya, the European population increased very fast, and between 1900 and 1935 Southern Rhodesia had more Europeans than any other country in tropical Africa.

There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone. Unfortunately, this integration was effected in a very disadvantageous and exploitative manner for Africa and not even twenty years of independence have funda› mentally altered the situation which has now become known as neo› colonialism."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

The slaving zones from Senegal to Sierra Leone, from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Nigeria and from the Congo river to Angola were the stretches of coast› line first encroached upon by the European colonizers. In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves. Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland. Indeed, they overestimated the amount of wealth which could be readily made if they penetrated to these sources.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > National prestige', 'content': ""The greatest exponent of this theory is Carlton Hayes.

The lesser powers, with no great prestige at stake, managed to get on without any new imperialism, though Portugal and Holland displayed a revived pride in the empires they already possessed and the latter's was administered with renewed vigor. 1S Hayes concludes therefore that 'the new imperialism' was basically 'a nationalistic phenomenon' and that its proponents hankered after national prestige. European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

I have endeavoured, in this series of letters, to give some description of the most important points along the coast which promise to come more prominently into notice in the future, and, as the waste and uninhabited places of the earth become fewer and fewer to attract, a larger European community than it does at present. I have said in a former letter that the West Coast of Africa is emphatically a place to visit, but not to live in. This remark, however, must be taken to apply merely to the coast as it is at present circumstanced, with its miasma, malaria, mangrove swamps, and discomforts generally. Sanitation has, in other portions of the globe, triumphed over difficulties as great as these, and, so far as I can judge, there do not appear to be any insurmountable obstacles to making the West Coast of Africa a fairly healthy, if not an altogether pleasant, place to live in. I do not for a moment suppose that it is ever likely to become exactly a health resort, but it must be recollected that up to the present it has hardly had a fair trial. The men who, as a rule, have been sent to the West Coast of Africa are those who have come there as a dernier ressort. They have naturally enough, I suppose, regarded it as their earthly purgatory wherein to expiate their offences against society or their incapacity for doing anything for themselves. They have done uncommonly little up to the present for the West Coast of Africa, which is probably about the only part of the world that has not only not advanced, but generally, whenever it has been in the possession of European Powers, retrograded of late years. The Europeans resident on it have been content to exist there, have regarded the chances of life with philosophic indifference, as mere incidents of the climate, and have looked upon their time spent in those regions as a period of their life completely wasted, to be got through somehow or another. As a consequence of all this, nothing has been done to improve either the places, the people, or the surroundings. The British colonies on the West Coast of Africa are a disgrace to the British Empire. They are inferior in every respect to those of any other Power in that part of the world—a fact which is, in my opinion, due to their having hitherto been regarded as receptacles for the failures and ne'er-do-wells of the British Islands. Were they administered by capable men, instead of being looked on with equanimity as pest-houses to be avoided at any cost, they might long since have ceased to be pest-houses, and have become centres of a great trade with the interior, which they are most certainly not at present.""}, {'id': 6622, 'article_title': 'The White Races in Africa', 'full_section_title': 'The White Races in Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1895#article-10', 'issue_date': '02_09_1895', 'content': 'Sir John Kirk, who has lived on the Zanzibar coast for twenty-five years, and has just returned from a special mission to the Niger, read the first paper. He assumed, in common with all who spoke afterwards, that the time has come for Europe to open up the Continent of Africa; and stated that though we know much about its interior we lack information about its climate; and elaborated the conditions necessary for successful European colonisation. Climate is a most important consideration, and all maritime zones and districts below 5,000 feet elevation must be dismissed as useless. In his treatment of such matters as malaria and fever, he said that canoe voyages along rivers are especially dangerous to health, but steamers and railways will give rapid access to the healthy areas. Yet the localities which fulfil the needful conditions are few; West Africa is out of the question, so far as regards its entire colonisation by Europeans. Sir John Kirk is of opinion that Matabeleland will probably be the first site of a colony in tropical Africa. There are further the high plateau west of Nyassa and Baloka land; and Masailand will be fit for colonisation when rapid access is given by the construction of a railway. The only other district possible for residence for the white races is Abyssinia. Nyassaland was mentioned as a district suitable for settlement and not colonisation. Such districts abound, and may be settled in by isolated European families, and become sanatoria or the homes of a few agricultural settlers. He condemns the advocacy of a half-caste race, but recommends the introduction of small colonies of British Indians in the districts less suited to Europeans as an example to the negro. This idea was further elaborated in the conclusion of the paper which had been written by Captain Lugard, and which Sir John Kirk read. Captain Lugard maintains that the object lesson of Indian village life will be an important factor in raising the negro; Indians will be invaluable as artisans and skilled labour men in the hot districts. Improved varieties of produce should be introduced, and the European should develop the country by the preservation of forests, protection of the elephant, zebra, and game, drainage of swamps, and reclamation of waste lands.\n\nCount Pfeil, delegate of the Thuringian Geographical Society, has taken a leading part in founding one of the German colonies, and he read a paper on the development of tropical Africa. He holds that this can best be achieved by scientific exploration and observation, and that to make tropical Africa healthy would be the greatest step towards colonising it. On the question of the Native races Count Pfeil said that he is not one of those who think that the negro can be guided by setting him a good example and reading homilies to him. The negro must have new wants created in him and must be localised in native reserves before he will lend the white man his regular and steady labour.'}]","[{'document_title': 'MR.

He knew that the impression they had acquired from various sources was that the beneficent results were enormous; but he had been enabled to see for himself the nature of those results and to draw his own conclusions, and he appeared before them to put a pin into the beautiful iridescent bubble which they had blown for themselves with the materials supplied by the ignorant, the interested, the colour-blind, and the hopelessly biassed. Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products. By-and-by, when they are taught, they will begin to cultivate the soil and raise products which are in demand in Europe. Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world.

As to the demand for\n\nour goods, that is a question that need not trouble us. The natives are fully alive to the advantage of British manufactures, and they will take any amount.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared.

The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

I said to some of them: \'You are spending millions of money on a line in which it must be wasted. Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty. The enterprises in East Africa, both of Englishmen and Germans, are only commercial movements, not colonisation, and are not only liable to but will share the fate which has befallen all great European, secular or religious, movements in equatorial Africa. You rightly consider that the agents in the work of Africa\'s regeneration are the civilised and Christianised negroes now in exile. Mahometanism, notwithstanding the sneers of some and the ignorance of others, is doing a wonderful work in Africa, really preserving the people against the unscrupulous proceedings of European traders and adventurers. The Arabs can do no harm, they as readily follow as lead in negro land. Jesus Christ as a religious reformer and as a regenerator of all the races of mankind was right. These organisations, which undertake to represent Him among foreign races, have not yet half understood Him, and He will not endorse work which not only contravenes the spirit but the letter of his teachings. After Europe shall have been purged of the wrongs which it has inflicted upon Africa, and has got rid of the gold unjustly acquired through the blood of the children of the Dark Continent, then it may be given to these would-be-masters of humanity to see the proper course both for their own and Africa\'s weal.""', 'last_edit_date': '1889-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_08_1889#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What the Royal Niger Company is Doing for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It looks as if chartered companies were the destined means of opening up and civilizing the Dark Continent. What the newly chartered East Africa Company are proposing to accomplish on the East Coast, the Royal Niger Company are doing on the West, and apparently with more success than the colonial Governments which draw their life from Downing-street. Lord Aberdare is Governor of the Royal Niger Company, and Sir George Taubman-Goldie Deputy-Governor; and in conversation with the latter a representative elicited some information as to the operations of the corporation. First of all, as to the difficulties which such companies have to encounter, they may be put down under three heads. The first great obstacle is this, that negroes have everything to learn. They have been accustomed hitherto to supply their immediate wants, and nothing more, so that beyond this minimum they have to be taught everything. It is slow work to teach them how to produce articles which are in request in Europe. A trade has been gradually growing up, but that only extends to certain regions, and, unfortunately for Western Africa, the articles of trade which have thus come into use—palm oil, for instance—have fallen very largely in price, as much as 50 per cent. That has been one of the great difficulties of the past three or four years. In the second place, there is the labour difficulty. Being unaccustomed to labour, they are averse to it. The Niger Company has had less to contend with in this respect than those in other parts of Africa, for although the natives near the coast are naturally idle, those in the interior are of more industrious habits. Some day imported labour will be necessary—either Chinese or coolie—not to extirpate the natives, but to serve as an example. The third great difficulty is the climate. Near the seaboard the country is undoubtedly pestilential. As you leave the mangrove swamps and palm forests behind and reach the interior, you come to a climate which, while totally unfit for European colonization, is fully as healthy as many parts of India. The difficulties arising from the climate are, therefore, not insuperable, if proper precautions are taken.\n\nWith respect to European jealousies and interference, there seems no ground for alarm on that score. The newspapers have reported that German merchants have complained of the administration of the Niger Company, but as a matter of fact there is not a single German trader in the whole of the Company's territory. There was one some time ago, but he was tried and deported by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., for a long period Chief Justice of the Gold Coast Colony, and now of the Niger territories. His offence was inciting the natives to rebellion and bloodshed.

There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry.

The Native population, which was estimated at about 200 millions, only required to be organised by the whites in order to raise the natural wealth of the continent. A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': 'By the mid-i930s British colonialism had been well entrenched by inte› grating the economy of tropical Africa into the world capitalist economy. The dependencies remained important sources of primary products with hardly any industrial sectors. Through participation in the cash sector, African peasants and workers experienced with the rest of the ,vorld some of the most serious economic adversities between 1929 and 1935. Neither the worker nor the peasant was a beneficiary of colonial economic relations, but the former experienced worse exploitation. The appropriation of the surplus by international capital is revealed by the backwardness and general poverty of the dependencies during the mid-i930S. Colonial administrators attempted, often feverishly, to arrest the increasing deterioration of soil fertility, especially in the native reserves where population pressure threatened land productivity, by restricting African cultivation. But Euro› pean exploitation of different resources was nowhere restricted. No one suggested, for example, that minerals should not be mined because they could never be replaced.$^{114}$ And mining, generally considered to be a modern sector, contributed only marginally to industrial life.

In 1932 Imperial Preference was introduced in British dependencies. Imports from the British Empire had customs duties fixed at between 10 and 50% lower than the general level. But since trade between the dependencies was negligible, the intended beneficiary of the arrangement was obviously Britain. In September 1931 the Colonial Office dispatched a circular to officers administering depen› dencies asking them to help Britain and reminding them that: the interests of the United Kingdom and those of the Colonies and Dependencies are inseparably bound up with one another, that the perils which face the United Kingdom are perils which menace the whole Empire ... that any general collapse of British credit and declir - in the exchange value of sterling must spell ruin for the colonies no less than for the United Kingdom. 83 Despite the higher tariff on non-British goods, their importation, to the advantage of consumers in the dependencies, increased greatly.

In 1934 the district officer of Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika, observed that 'practically every shop in the district'$^{84}$ was stocked with many Japanese goods. The development was especially important during this period of economic distress.

But the limited nature of African participation should guide our assessment. Mining was established with foreign capital, and profits accruing from the industry were repatriated to swell the pockets of shareholders abroad, or to develop economies outside Africa. For instance, when the Charter of the Niger Company was revoked in 1899, the company was compensated £150000 for its mining rights in the region where tin mining was later established. According to the same agreement, the company was to receive as much as 50% of all royalties from mining for ninety-nine years.$^{59}$ This was a very heavy price for the local population to pay, but the situation was even worse in the Rhodesias, where mining rights remained in the hands of the British South Africa Company until 1933 when they were purchased by the state for £2 000 000.$^{60}$ But even after this change the local population was rarely regarded, and even more rarely treated, as the beneficiaries of mining operations. As late as 1942, a high-ranking official in the British Colonial Office shamelessly placed on record that 'there is particularly little reason for reserving the value of the mineral product to the local inhabitants when those inhabitants have done nothing to develop it'.$^{61}$ But even where the colonial administrations nationalized minerals, as was the case in Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, little revenue, mainly from royalties and income tax, was realized. In Sierra Leone direct revenue from minerals in 1935 was £34100, which was only 5% of total revenue. 62 Wages remained the only way by which the local population could have acquired a substantial portion of the proceeds from mining, but, as was the case in settler and plantation agriculture, they were kept so low that wage earners had to be subsidized by the peasant sector.

Before the colonial era both Southern Rhodesia and the Gold Coast, where the local population had mined and worked gold for generations, were noted for their potential mineral wealth rather than their agricultural prospects. In Nigeria, too, the local population had mined and worked tin for generations before the white men penetrated the interior.

The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Certainly, until the early 1930s, the tendency was to encourage whoever was likely to contribute in this respect. Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

Where the plantations were non-British but direct supply zones for British manu› facturing interests, Great Britain tended to 'condone' slavery. One instance was the American South. A second was Cuba and Brazil, which continued through most of the nineteenth century to obtain slaves from the still permitted trade 'south of the line', where the economies of the slave trade remained different, as we indicated above. 44 The nineteenth century up to Partition was, it has been argued, the era of 'informal empire' or the 'imperialism of free trade'.

Hence the fact that the role of the chartered companies in eighteenth-century West Africa was less than in the seven› teenth century has led some historians to speak of the rise of free trade. The very process of dismantling of the monopoly powers of chartered companies was however 'a gradual one', we are told; the shift to free trade 'was therefore somewhat limited'; and the explanation of the shift resided primarily in 'practical business reasons', to wit, the lower overhead costs and greater flexibility of response to an expanding slave-trade market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.724, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': ""Plantation slavery depended for its economic viability on reducing its total costs below a certain level, which depended heavily on the fact that recruitment to slave status was principally by means other than demographic reproduction. We have already suggested that the very process of expanding the quantity of slaves 'recruited' began to transform the economic character of the slave trade in western Africa, increasing the 'opportunity costs' of slave-trading and thereby affecting the rate of world accumulation.\nThis general phenomenon combined with a more narrow British concern.\nThe comparative productivity of sugar plantations in British West Indian territories declined throughout the eighteenth century.$^{40}$ A major zone of alternative production available was in British India.$^{41}$ This zone, however, was an area of existing dense agricultural production, where true slavery would have been economically too costly (if one wished to enslave the indigenous population) or politically too difficult (if one wished to import others).

Given the fact that 'the bigger financiers clearly had a foot in both camps' (ibid., p. 86), the resulting Parliamentary decisions might be seen as a compromise: the West Indian lobby lost on abolition but won on the East Indian tariff.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

There are those lands which, by their climate and the sparseness of their population, are fitted for Colonisation and exploitation by people of our own race; and there are those in tropical or torrid regions where immigrants of the white race can scarcely hope to make a permanent settlement, on account of the unsuitability of the climate and also from the fact of those lands being already occupied by a numerous native population. In such lands as India, British Guiana, and Western Africa, the object of their absorption into the British Empire is different from that which has actuated the acquirement of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We do not aspire to make them new homes for the British race, but so to govern and control their inhabitants that they (the natives), who, it may be, belong to quite a different variety of man, may be instructed to develop the resources of their country to the greatest advantage to British trade and to themselves. No philanthropy is sound and lasting that is not based on self-interest, and it is only just that, in return for the great work we have carried out in lands like India, we should be rewarded by an increase in our trade with the East, and, consequently, in our national wealth. There is no civiliser like the railway, and to build a railway through an uncivilised country is to centuple existing trade or to create it if none exists; the railway saps race prejudices and dissolves fanaticism. Similar results are attained by the establishment of a line of steamers to the ports of a barbarous country; but what body of philanthropists would construct a railway or establish a line of steamers without some sign that their money and labour had not been thrown away? Consequently we should profit by that instinct that urges us not to rest satisfied with letting rich countries lie idle because the natives are too ignorant to appreciate the advantages with which their soil has been endowed.\n\nWestern Africa is a portion of the world similar in many respects to India.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results.

We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained. For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMANDER CAMERON ON CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Jan. 14th, Commander Cameron, in the Rooms of the Incorporated Chamber of Commerce at Liverpool, delivered an address on ""The Commerce of Central Africa."" Colonel Paris presided, and there was a large attendance of members and others interested. Commander Cameron, who, on rising, was loudly applauded, said: What he wished to speak about was the commerce of Africa, and what would come out of the Berlin Conference, and other events which were now happening; for the Conference could not fail to be of great importance to British trade. Tropical Africa, except in a few cases, on the shores of great water-ways, was scarcely known. From the interior the difficulties of transport prevented any profit except on the most valuable products. The first idea of the trader seemed ivory. India-rubber was coming into use, and before he left the West Coast over £20,000 worth had been exported from Zanzibar in one year. Many valuable gums and spices were found in Central Africa. Africa was to all appearance, until a few years ago, the happy hunting ground of Englishmen; it was only those who voyaged who could really compete with us. Now all these things were changed, and on every side they saw a scramble for Africa. It was our duty to know as much as possible about the resources of this continent, and how the future of Africa was to be controlled by the Congo Free State, which promised to be the outcome of the Berlin Conference. Very great results were to be expected, and he might mention that, north-east of Victoria Nyanza, there was a plateau which might be colonized by Europeans, and whence trade might be put into some of the great producing centres of Africa. The trade of the Arab at Zanzibar was carried out by a system of advance. On the west coast there was a trade carried on by a few Europeans. In the last century the Portuguese had an enormous trade up the Zambesi, and in Zumbo Town there were the ruins of a cathedral and a university which had at one time 370 students. There were two other towns of equal importance. The great difficulty in this trade was the climate. At a conference in Brussels in 1876, the idea of an International Association was sketched, and the King of the Belgians had set himself steadfastly to work to further this great idea of promoting the civilization of the ""Dark Continent."" Nearly all the people of Africa were traders; the cultivation of the soil was relegated to the women. At Nyanza there were enormous assemblies of people, some of whom came to market 15 or 20 miles, travelling against the current of the Congo. From this locality he had brought home nutmegs that were of the greatest use in commerce. From the same region there came wild coffee. There were enormous districts where any amount of rice could be grown; you had only to ""scratch the earth,"" and it smiled at you. At some of these interior stations whole caravans were supplied by small villages with wheat sufficient for a week\'s journey. The people of those villages were able to produce for from ten to twelve times their number with scarcely any labour. On the Niger we had utilized water traffic, and the Congo had a number of miles of water carriage which could be utilized. There was, at the same time, the great difficulty of getting from the coast to this system on the Congo. Various schemes had been proposed to connect Stanley Pool with the Congo by railway, and he believed that after the settlement of the dispute between France and the International Association, the French would construct a railway to Stanley Pool, or the Association from the left bank of the Congo, and they would then be able to have instant communication with the centre of Africa. Further south, the Portuguese were beginning to wake up to the value of their territories. They were now making contracts to construct a railway into the interior. It was their duty as Englishmen to look after that scheme. The region he was speaking of produced ivory, gum, cotton, and spices. The Powers at the Berlin Conference had recognized the International Association as practically a sovereign State. What they must strongly insist upon was free trade, and permission to reside and trade in the Free State. Another point was as to the mode in which future annexations were to be made. Annexations had been going on rather fast lately, and the Conference agreement was to the effect that when a place was annexed notice was to be sent to the other countries, and that people trading at such a place were to continue trading under the same guarantees as formerly. He fancied that would be simply that there might be equal rights to all nations, and people already trading in places which had no European sovereign might find their positions injured by annexation on the part of European Powers. In this matter, also, he thought that great care had to be exercised. Then they had to think of the great trade which used to pass down Egypt from the Upper Nile. The Suakin and Berber Railway was contracted for at one time by Ismail Pasha, but he was compelled to give up the idea. If that railway had been built, we should have had none of the difficulties in the Soudan which we had at present. He mentioned as a sign of the times that an Ambassador from Timbuctoo was at Paris treating with the President of the French Republic. We had the trade of the Lower Niger in our hands, but in the Upper Niger a great portion of the trade might be diverted from us if the proposed railway were completed. There was one thing which he must say, and that was that if we wanted outlets for our goods we must send proper and suitable goods for the people. The establishment of the Congo Free State would prove a benefit to English trade, but we must watch the constitution of that State, and, if there were any objectionable features in it, get them removed. In conclusion, Commander Cameron remarked that in a very large portion of Africa cotton of very good quality grew. He had specimens at home of cotton goods which had been made by the natives in the interior, and he believed that, as communication improved they would see cargoes of cotton coming to Liverpool from Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Operations of the British East Africa Company', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The products of the Kesmayu and Juba rivers district are detailed with the prices in the London market: These are—ivory, indiarubber, maize, millet, simsim, orchella weed, hides, rice. Besides these, cotton, tobacco, ground nuts, and opium are produced on the coast; while in the interior are vast herds of cattle and sheep, besides ghee, gums, senna, ebony, Manilla fibre, and ostrich feathers. In the Upper Juba rubies and emeralds are obtainable, and gold is reported at Bardera. But, putting all conjectural treasure aside, over all the coast regions, and up the Sabaki river, there is ample scope for plantation work. To the south of Mount Kenia are large districts, fertile and salubrious.\n\nIn the Witu and Tana district cotton cultivation is making progress, and an account is given of the working and results of a plantation at Wange, near the port of Lamu, the crop of which amounted to 80,000lb. ""lint cotton"" (Sea Island), 140,000lb. of cotton seed, and 20,000lb. of refuse. Samples have been valued at a higher assessment than that of American cotton then in the market. According to returns the profit on an expenditure of under £1,200 was £370, or over 30 per cent. In Liverpool this cotton, is pronounced ""better than any but the best Egyptian."" The natives are said to be anxious to grow cotton, and it would undoubtedly pay a planter to establish at Lamu machinery for cleaning and pressing cotton for export. On the cotton estates cocoanut trees have been planted and do not interfere with the cultivation of cotton.\n\nSatisfactory reports are given of the tobacco cultivation at Witu; and very full information is given as to the possibilities of cultivation of a variety of commercial products; and with regard to the interior, evidence is given that the American rubber trees might be introduced and flourish as well as the indigenous *Landolphia*.

It shows that Sir William Mackinnon and his friends have really got hold of a ""good thing"" commercially, which, with judicious management, may in the future yield satisfactory results.\n\nOne interesting point as regards slavery is brought out in the report. The Company have granted freedom papers to 2,634 slaves. It was the practice of Government to grant a bonus of £5 per head to the mission societies who took charge of released slaves, and, as no allowance is made to the Company, the sum of £13,140 has been saved to the Treasury.

H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trading operations of Europeans in West Africa are carried on after the following manner: The trader selects a site suitable—generally by the side of a river or creek, or along the seashore—and comes to terms with the owner of the soil or the native chief of the district for the leasing of the land, the natives retaining a dislike to alienating any part of their country.

With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa. Yearly the improvement continues; more and more the great trading companies of Liverpool and Bristol have realised that their interests are better served by men of good manners and refinement.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the Balloon Society, on July 18, a lecture was delivered by Captain V.

Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear.

The General History of Africa highlights various coercive measures such as treaties, military expeditions, and manipulation of local governance structures, but does not specifically mention the imposition of fines on leaders in Benin, Dahomey, and Bonny. Instead, it focuses on broader strategies like the use of taxes and forced labor to integrate African economies into the colonial system, with the punitive expedition against Benin in 1897 and the imposition of governing councils in the Niger Delta serving as key examples. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific instances where fines were used as a coercive tool, such as the substantial fine of 500 puncheons of palm oil imposed on the King of Dahomey for outrages against British subjects, enforced through threats of blockades or military action. The articles also describe how these fines influenced local governance, as seen in Bonny, where trade was halted until a fine was paid, and highlight the economic exploitation aspect, with fines often paid in valuable resources like palm oil shipped to England. However, the articles do not mention Benin in the context of fines, which is a notable difference from the claim. Together, these sources illustrate a broader theme of economic exploitation and control, with The African Times providing specific examples of fines as a tool, while the General History of Africa emphasizes other coercive strategies.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights into the coercive strategies employed by colonial powers, particularly the British, to exert control over African leaders and exploit economic resources. However, it does not specifically mention the imposition of fines on leaders in Benin, Dahomey, and Bonny as a tool for such purposes. Instead, the text highlights other coercive measures, such as the use of treaties, military expeditions, and manipulation of local governance structures. For instance, the British launched a punitive expedition against Benin in 1897, leading to the looting and burning of the capital. In the Niger Delta, British consuls imposed governing councils on local states after the arrest and deportation of Jaja of Opobo. The text also discusses the broader colonial strategy of using taxes and forced labor to integrate African economies into the colonial system. While fines are not explicitly mentioned, the use of taxes and other economic pressures aligns with the claim's broader theme of economic exploitation. The absence of specific references to fines in the textbook is a notable difference from the claim, suggesting that while fines may have been used, they were not highlighted as a primary tool in the historical narrative provided.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that colonial powers, particularly the British, used the imposition of fines on African leaders as a coercive tool to exert control, influence local governance, and exploit economic resources.

These fines were often substantial, such as the 500 puncheons of palm oil imposed on the King of Dahomey, and were enforced through threats of blockades or military action, indicating a coercive approach to ensure compliance. Additionally, the articles describe how the British used these fines to influence local governance, as seen in the case of Bonny, where trade was stopped until a fine was paid.

Though Benin had signed a treaty of protection with the British in 1892, she none the less guarded her sovereignty with determination. This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""The introduction of money taxes was briefly accompanied by labour taxes, the most obvious expression of European attempts to enlist labour forcibly into the economic organization of the colonial effort.

Conversely, the Germans in the Cameroon allowed the capitation tax to be remitted by a labour 'payment'. And in parts of Uganda, the British continued the luwalo, a pre-colonial public-work tax of one month's labour, until 1938, when it was replaced by a money tax.

It is true that such direct forced labour declined in the early twentieth century, because of the decreasing need for portage as well as the increasing concern with international opinion. But the uses, however modified, remained an integral part of colonial domination until the Second World War. At least this was the case with the French colonial governments which, as in West Africa still employed large numbers of Africans through prestation particularly on railway building until after the Second World War.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

The imperial German government succeeded in callously crushing African unrest in Cameroon, South West Africa (now Namibia) and German East Africa (now Tanzania) between 1904 and 1907; but there› after Social Democrats intervened to reform the colonial order through legislation in the Reichstag. When the disposition of German colonies became an issue after 1918, Britain took the lead in arguing that Germany should be permanently deprived of its colonies because German colonialism was supposedly more coercive. Arguments were marshalled imputing the continuation of slavery and the generalized resort to flogging by German authorities.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

Some time ago a dispute arose between the natives and the European traders, which eventually resulted in the factory of one of the traders being attacked and ransacked by the natives. In consequence of this outrage, and the loss sustained, a fine was imposed upon the natives by Commodore Wilmot. For a long time the natives refused to comply with the Commodore's injunction; refused all commercial intercourse with the traders, and openly intimated to the Commodore that they would not pay the fine, which, of course, was to be paid in produce—palm-oil. At last matters came to a crisis; the European residents at Benin feared that they would be personally attacked by the natives, and asked for protection. Commodore Wilmot at once proceeded in the screw corvette Rattlesnake, 21 guns, and with a large portion of the squadron, to Benin. His arrival there with so formidable a force had the desired effect upon the natives, who professed to have no evil intentions towards the British residents, but, on the contrary, were desirous of resuming trade and paying the fine imposed. This was at once done; and after being admonished by the Commodore on their past conduct, they promised to be good for the future, and to open trade at once, which was done.

Dr. Gouldsbury reached that place on January 31, having gone from Cape Coast, vid Kumasi, making the journey from Kumasi to Salagha in nine days. M. Bonnat, a French merchant, and one of the European captives released by Sir Garnet Wolseley from the hands of the King of Ashanti in 1874, and Mr. Robert Bannerman, a native merchant from Accra, reached Salagha twenty-four hours before Dr. Gouldsbury, having made the journey from Accra and Addah by the Volta route. The party were well received by the natives. At Salagha they were welcomed by a guard of 200 horsemen. A large trade in gold, ivory, Shea butter, cotton, horses, &c., is expected to flow down from Salagha and countries beyond. The Coast generally is quiet just now. It is reported that the King of Dahomey was about to attack Abeokuta at the time this mail was leaving Lagos. This monarch has been recently fined 30,000 dollars by the British authorities for having permitted his chiefs at Whydah to maltreat a Mr. Turnbull, agent at that port for Messrs. Swanzy, of London. Commodore Sir William Hewett called off there a fortnight ago to inquire into the matter, which has resulted in the fine. If not paid by the end of June, the Coast will be blockaded. Another rumour gives out that Governor Strahan will leave this colony in April next, on a visit to England for the benefit of his health; Captain C. Lees, the present Administrator at Lagos, acting in Captain Strahan's absence as Lieutenant-Governor of the Gold Coast Colony. The King of Wassaw has been fined 100 ounces of gold and sentenced to five years' imprisonment for slave-dealing. The King of Juabin is still in Cape Coast, having gone there at the command of Governor Strahan. It is not true that peace has been established between the King of Ashanti and the King of Juabin. They have ceased to fight simply because they cannot get at each other.""}, {'id': 3090, 'article_title': 'Fine on the King of Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'Fine on the King of Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_05_1876', 'content': '## FINE ON THE KING OF DAHOMEY.\n\n**CAPE COAST CASTLE, March 14.**—News from Whydah states that the fine imposed on the King of Dahomey is 500 puncheons of palm oil, value 6,000l.; time given to the 1st of June.

We do not mean that they would proceed to greater extremities in their horrible excesses and barbarous despotism than in the past; but that the time would come when the civilized countries of Europe, and Great Britain in especial, would rouse themselves from their inertia as regards Dahoman atrocities and outrages, and take some effective steps for curbing that savage will in which they have originated. The late visit of the British squadron under Commodore Sir William Hewett to the waters of Whydah, his inquiry into reported outrages committed at that place by the local authorities of the King of Dahomey upon the persons of certain British and French subjects employed in mercantile affairs there, and his imposition of a fine of 500 puncheons of oil, equivalent to the sum of £6,000, to be enforced by blockade if not paid before the end of June next, may be regarded as the first letters of “the handwriting on the wall” foretelling the destruction of a system the devilish action of which, both externally and internally, is at the present time a standing insult to humanity. It is the more significant of “the handwriting on the wall” by a supreme Divine Power, that this first step in the right direction by Great Britain as regards Dahomey should have been made, and most righteously made, by a British naval officer, after consultation with the Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, without any previous communication with, or any direct instructions from, Her Majesty’s Government, at the very time when the Government of France, acting under the malefic influence and representations of the old Marseilles slave-trade interests, should have made difficulties about the acquisition of Gambia, which it has so long and so mightily desired, because it was called upon, as one of the conditions, to relinquish any supposed claims it might have upon a worthless old fort at Whydah, formerly used by French slave-dealers as a slave depôt, and since as mercantile stores. It is, of course, only a logical sequence to what has been done at other parts of the West Coast of Africa, the so-called oil rivers and elsewhere, that the commander of a British squadron should thus inquire into outrages and injuries inflicted by native authorities on British merchants and their employés, impose and levy fines, and stop the trade of the place until those fines were paid. But the present is the first occasion on which this wholesome discipline has been brought to bear upon his Majesty of Dahomey, and we hope from it some very salutary results. Up to the time of our writing there has not been any intelligence received as to the emotions and intentions of the King that may have found expression in words or deeds when he heard of this fine of 500 puncheons of oil, and a blockade if it be not paid at a certain time. He was absent from his capital, engaged with his forces in their annual raid in the Egba countries, mention of which is made in our Abeokuta and Lagos news,—raids which ought not any longer to be permitted by Great Britain, as the interests of her settlement at Lagos are grievously injured thereby,—raids that may be effectually prevented by the cutting off from the King of Dahomey of those supplies of ammunition and other warlike stores which he receives through Whydah. But we fully expect to hear that one of his Majesty’s earliest commands has been the sacrifice of those Whydah authorities who committed the outrages complained of (and inquired into by Sir William Hewett) in their endeavours to satisfy the royal greed, which, as is well known to those acquainted with affairs on the West Coast of Africa, is insatiate, and ever looking to Whydah for renewed supplies. Next, we expect he will offer apologies, and point to his victims, the sacrificed and murdered authorities, as proof that all such deeds had been opposed to his principles, orders, and desires. But this will not do. Not one penny or one gallon of oil of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett ought to be or can be remitted. The decision of a British authority in this matter—a decision arrived at after due inquiry—must be upheld by Her Majesty’s Government as absolute and...'}, {'id': 3133, 'article_title': 'Imperial Parliament', 'full_section_title': 'Imperial Parliament', 'last_edit_date': '05-16-1876', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-24', 'issue_date': '01_06_1876', 'content': ""Lord Cottesloe asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he could communicate to the House any information received by Her Majesty's Government respecting the measures recently taken by the naval and civil authorities of the Gold Coast against the King of Dahomey, and the fine demanded of him for outrages committed on British subjects at Whydah. The noble lord said that it appeared that after an inquiry conducted upon the coast the King of Dahomey had been convicted and fined 500 barrels of palm oil, but it did not appear that in the first instance any application was made to the King. The fine imposed amounted in value to about 6,000l.—a large amount for a monarch in his condition to be called on to pay. No doubt he had dealt in an overbearing and unscrupulous way; he had said also that if the Commodore went for his fine he would be paid in bullets and powder; but still, if we resorted to extremities, it might lead to great inconvenience. The result now seemed to be that ulterior measures must be taken, and the question was, what those measures should be. The first suggestion no doubt that arose was, that there should be a blockade of the coast; but this would not be very injurious to the King himself, for the real sufferers would be the English, French, and Portuguese who had property there, and whose business would be entirely stopped by the blockade. If this should take place without effect, then they would demand that more energetic measures should be taken and that something more should be done. We should then have the alternative of going to the King's capital as we went to that of the King of Ashanti; but it was not probable that the Government would like to undertake another expedition of that kind. They might take possession of Whydah as a material guarantee. He quite concurred that naval and military officers belonging to this country should always be ready to undertake such responsibility as might be necessary for the interests of the country, and he felt satisfied that the Government at home would afford them protection against that responsibility; but still a good deal would depend upon the time that there was in which to communicate with the Government. In this case they might have done so before they undertook the expedition. He trusted that the Government would take the matter into their own hands, and also that they would give the House any information that they were able to afford.""}, {'id': 3170, 'article_title': 'WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH DAHOMEY?', 'full_section_title': 'WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH DAHOMEY?', 'last_edit_date': '08-01-1876', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1876#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_08_1876', 'content': 'The public mind is chiefly exercised in England as to what may be the final result of the complications in Eastern Europe. The little cloud of Herzegovinian insurrection which rose suddenly last year on the Eastern horizon has spread until there is now active hostility between Turkey and Servia and Montenegro; while there are strong indications that its dark folds will soon also envelope Roumania. In a word, the area of conflict is extending in those countries, and it is by no means impossible that Turkey will soon have really to fight its ""battle of life"" against its revolted dependencies, which are seemingly determined, if possible, to cast off entirely the rule and suzerainté of the great Mohammedan empire. Notwithstanding the deep interest which we naturally feel in this spreading war darkness and its possible results, our thoughts are not the less turned toward that barbarous State in West Africa which, according to the latest news, seems to be determined, in its heathen ignorance and insolence, to oppose its puny might to the strength of Great Britain. To the English mind nothing can, of course, appear more ridiculous than war between Great Britain and Dahomey. It could only be a collision between an earthen and an iron pot, with the one inevitable result; for we presume that if the monster of Dahomey should really make it necessary for Great Britain to send an expedition into his country, there will not be a repetition in his case of the grievous error that has been committed in Ashanti—error which has doubtless not been without its influence at Abomey. A few hours\' occupation of that blood-stained place, and the destruction of one or more of the extensive royal huts which are dignified with the name of ""palaces,"" would not by any means respond to the necessities of the situation. Habitually watching events in Western Africa as under the guidance of Divine Providence, we thought that we foresaw in the very act of the formation of the Gold Coast Colony (following after the Ashanti expedition) the beginning of the end of Dahomey as a State in West Africa. Our readers will perhaps remember that we expressed this belief very strongly at the time. It was from our point of view clearly impossible, the Gold Coast and Lagos being united in one Gold Coast Colony, that the little semi-Dahoman villages between Quittah and Whydah, with this latter and Godomey, could continue for any length of time under other rule and control than that of the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, acting for and in the name of Queen Victoria. We did not, of course, see in advance what event was to bring up the ""little cloud"" on the Dahoman horizon. But little clouds are constantly arising in West African horizons, and the ignorant pride and cupidity of Dahoman rulers might well be trusted to raise such a one as that which necessitated the visit of Commodore Sir William Hewett to Whydah, and the infliction by him of a fine on the King and State of Dahomey. The King\'s insolent refusal to pay this fine had made it imperative to blockade Whydah and the neighbouring sea-coast villages or towns east and west of that place; and such blockade commenced, we doubt not, as appointed by Her Majesty\'s Government, on the 1st of July. The question now naturally arises whether the payment of the fine originally inflicted ought to free the King of Dahomey, since he has imposed on Great Britain the trouble and expense of sending a fleet of ships of war to enforce it. We think not. Independently of our anxious desire to see Dahomey extinguished as an independent State, we feel that the petty barbarians along the West Coast ought to have full conviction brought home to them by a signal example that the majesty of Great Britain is not to be insulted and defied with impunity. It is for the benefit of Benin, Brass, Bonny, Opobo, Old and New Calabar, and Cameroons, that this conviction should become fully impressed on the minds of the people and rulers of those places. They ought to be made thoroughly to understand by one great example that whenever their misdeeds render it necessary to impose a fine on them, that fine must be paid without the necessity being created of the presence of a squadron to enforce and receive payment. As regards precedent for this, we need not be in any doubt. Since Germany exacted five thousand millions of francs from France for the trouble and expense of beating her armies, forcing an entrance into her capital, and stripping her of Alsace and Lorraine, we have a precedent for all time, ample to cover every demand that irresistible power may make and enforce. Dahomey has given Great Britain occasion to exercise control over her affairs. She has continuously injured the British Settlement at Lagos by her annual inroads into the Egba territory in quest of plunder, slaves, and victims, to be slaughtered in the ""Customs"" at Abomey. British remonstrance has been useless—received with little less than contempt. Those slave-hunting raids and fearful butcheries, at the behest of a sanguinary superstition, are said to be absolutely necessary to the continued existence of the Dahoman kingdom. No stronger evidence can surely be required of the absolute necessity of destroying such a kingdom. Our readers will find in another column the account given by an escaped Liberian, named ""Tubman,"" who was captured by the Dahomans under the walls of Abeokuta during one of those annual incursions. The narrative is full of food for thought at this time, and we think it will be read with deep interest. Since that was in type we have received a second edition of it from another and very able native correspondent. In this account he says: ""The 800 captives taken with Tubman were men, women, children, and infants, kidnapped and otherwise taken in the Egba farms. When they arrived at Abomey, which they reached in six days (there was much halting on the way), they were taken to the high priest of the national gods. It was for him to decide who were to be sacrificed, and who to be spared. He divined by means of water and kola nuts. In this way 150 of Tubman\'s fellow-captives were selected for a grand sacrifice which was offered in December last. Tubman was assigned to a priest of ""Shango,"" the God of Thunder, to be one of his attendants. Shango priests are held in much superstitious dread, the King greatly supporting them. It is customary to administer to all captives who are not to be sacrificed, but distributed between the King, his warriors, priests, and others, a ""Lethe,"" so that they may forget home and its associations, and have no inclination to escape. This ""Lethe"" consists of boiling spirits mixed with the blood of a slave, flowing fresh from his throat, which is cut while his head is held over the steaming spirits, which have also some vegetable powders mixed with them. The slave whose blood is to be thus drank by his companions is always thus killed in their presence. A good quantity of this preparation is administered to each. None dare refuse it. Tubman had to drink about half a pint of this vile and abominable preparation."" This is the Dahomey with which Great Britain is now brought into collision—a land drunk with the blood of victims, shed to gratify the brutal passions of the dominant section of its people, and the inordinate thirst of its so-called gods. Let it be remembered that these cruel butcheries and vile abominations are continual, from day to day and year to year. Are we not, then, justified in saying that, having now a pretext for interference with a kingdom which thus stains the earth, and which greatly injures our neighbouring possessions, it is our duty, as evidently charged with the propaganda of civilization and the vindication of the rights of humanity on the West Coast, to extend our arm in the small degree necessary to put an end at once and for ever to one of the most monstrous systems that ever encumbered and insulted this earth?

In spite of the efforts of the missionaries and the Consul to abolish the cruelties and barbarous practices of the natives there, there are still many of the old customs in vogue.

The unfortunate slave, after two or three days\' exposure to the sun, with nothing to eat or drink, expired, and was found dead by some of the natives, a pool of blood marking the place of his murder. Bokko was at once arrested by King Adam Archibong, and after several days\' confinement was fined sixty boxes of brass rods, a fine equal to 120£. of English money. It appeared that the man had misconducted himself with one of Bokko\'s wives.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

1571,The inquiry into the West Coast of Africa aimed to enhance the region's moral and economic conditions by exploring its potential wealth in minerals and vegetation.,"The inquiry into the West Coast of Africa, as examined through the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles, presents a complex interplay of motivations and outcomes. The textbook provides a nuanced view, suggesting that European colonial interest in West Africa was primarily driven by economic gain, focusing on the exploitation of the region's rich mineral and agricultural resources. It highlights significant economic changes during the colonial period, such as the development of the mining industry and the cultivation of cash crops, but underscores that these efforts often excluded Africans from benefiting and were monopolized by foreign companies, indicating a focus on profit rather than moral improvement. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim that the inquiry aimed to enhance the region's moral and economic conditions. They emphasize the potential for economic development through mining operations and the cultivation of valuable vegetation like cotton, coffee, and palm oil. The articles also highlight the moral aspirations associated with the inquiry, noting the role of missionaries and the importance of combining civilization with Christianity to uplift the local population. Despite challenges such as the unhealthiness of the climate and the need for better management and capital investment, the articles align with the claim by illustrating both the economic potential and moral aspirations. Together, these sources reveal a discrepancy between the historical account of economic exploitation and the narrative of moral and economic enhancement, reflecting differing perspectives on the colonial motivations and impacts in West Africa.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide a nuanced view of the economic and moral motivations behind European colonial interest in West Africa, particularly in terms of mineral and agricultural exploitation. The text highlights the significant economic changes during the colonial period, such as the development of the mining industry and the cultivation of cash crops, which were driven by the discovery and exploitation of Africa's rich natural resources. However, the narrative does not explicitly support the claim that the inquiry into the West Coast of Africa was aimed at enhancing the region's moral and economic conditions. Instead, it suggests that the primary motivation was economic gain for the colonizers, often at the expense of local populations. The exclusion of Africans from benefiting from their mineral resources and the monopolization by foreign companies indicate a focus on profit rather than moral improvement. Additionally, the text mentions the commercialization of land and the increase in consumer goods demand, but these developments are framed as consequences of economic exploitation rather than deliberate efforts to improve local conditions. Therefore, while the paragraphs discuss the exploration of potential wealth in minerals and vegetation, they do not align with the claim that these efforts were intended to enhance the region's moral and economic conditions. This discrepancy highlights a significant difference between the claim and the historical account provided in the textbook.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the inquiry into the West Coast of Africa aimed to enhance the region's moral and economic conditions by exploring its potential wealth in minerals and vegetation. The articles highlight the region's rich mineral resources, particularly gold, and the potential for economic development through mining operations, as seen in the discussions about the Gold Coast and Wassaw. The articles also emphasize the abundance of valuable vegetation, such as cotton, coffee, and palm oil, which could be cultivated for commercial purposes. Additionally, there is a focus on the moral improvement of the region, with mentions of the role of missionaries and the importance of combining civilization with Christianity to uplift the local population.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods. Thirdly, the growing of cash crops by Africans enabled individuals of whatever social status, especially in the rural areas, to acquire wealth."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Minerals', 'content': ""A number of the former British dependencies of tropical Africa were rich in a variety of mineral resources (see Figs. 16.2 and 16.3).

In Nigeria, too, the local population had mined and worked tin for generations before the white men penetrated the interior. Thus in a number of cases prospecting during the colonial period started with locating areas where mining had been carried out by the local population.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

In Northern Rhodesia, copper was mined from 1910, but it was not until the late 1920s when the mines came into full production that minerals made an appreciable impression on the export sector. From 1931 minerals contributed over 50% of the total value of domestic exports. The proportion increased considerably in subsequent years. In Sierra Leone mining started late, but by 1935 minerals contributed over 50% of domestic exports. In 1936 mineral exports in British dependencies of tropical Africa stood in the following order of importance: Northern Rhodesia, £5094000; Southern Rhodesia, £4422000; Gold Coast, £2124213 and Sierra Leone, £1245000.

But the limited nature of African participation should guide our assessment. Mining was established with foreign capital, and profits accruing from the industry were repatriated to swell the pockets of shareholders abroad, or to develop economies outside Africa. For instance, when the Charter of the Niger Company was revoked in 1899, the company was compensated £150000 for its mining rights in the region where tin mining was later established. According to the same agreement, the company was to receive as much as 50% of all royalties from mining for ninety-nine years.$^{59}$ This was a very heavy price for the local population to pay, but the situation was even worse in the Rhodesias, where mining rights remained in the hands of the British South Africa Company until 1933 when they were purchased by the state for £2 000 000.$^{60}$ But even after this change the local population was rarely regarded, and even more rarely treated, as the beneficiaries of mining operations.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: North Africa', 'section_title': 'Part I: the economy of Tunisia, Algeria and MorOCCO, I919-35 A.

The French occupation of Algeria shattered the economic unity of North Africa by deflecting trans-Saharan trade to routes east and west of Algeria and by disrupting east-west caravan traffic along the northern fringe of the desert. The advance of the French army was a direct and immediate manifestation of the impact of Europe, a presence more remote if no less real elsewhere because of the shifting volume and composition of trans-Saharan trade. By the end of the century trans-Saharan trade, with the revenue and ready supply of labour it brought, had all but collapsed. The importance of this trade in the lives of nomads suggests the need for further research on the effects of shifts in commerce and its decline: what was the effect of the formation of the state ruled by 'Abd al-Kädir astride a major east-west route? How precisely did desert people react to shifts in commerce? How did declining trade affect resistance? The French occupation of the desert also introduced a new military factor in the relationship between desert oeople and the outside world. The mobility of nomads allowed a number >f options in resistance that might coalesce around Muslim leaders and .eligious orders, but the arid environment often limited the freedom of groups or individuals with shared resources by presenting them with a choice between resistance and survival. Another subject for further research is the uneven and dissimilar effect of European economic penetration on the regional economies at the fringe of the desert in pre-Saharan Morocco which was dominated by Ait Atta expansion; in coastal Morocco where trans-Atlas and trans-Saharan economic links were shaken to their foun› dations; in Algeria where the activities of the French were predominant; north of the Senegal basin where gum exports increased the stakes in competition among Moorish groups; north of the Niger bend; in the Sokoto caliphate where economic strength must be seen in light of the end of the Atlantic slave trade as well as Islamization and centralization within the region; in the Chad basin; and to the east where the expansion of Wadai transformed both the desert to its north and the forest to its south. The history of each of these regions raises a series of questions on issues such as change in social stratification, similarities and differences in response to the French army, and the direction of reorientation in regional economies.

Churchill said the right hon. gentleman had amply shown the necessity for inquiry into the state of affairs on the West Coast of Africa, and he felt, as he was sure the House must feel, great satisfaction that the right hon. gentleman had redeemed so early in the session the pledge he gave last year. (Hear, hear.) The unfortunate Ashantee war, which last year was the cause of so much pain in the House, was of itself sufficient ground for a committee, but there were other reasons why an inquiry should be now undertaken. The state of affairs on the West Coast of Africa was now, and had been for a considerable period, most unsatisfactory. Without any intention to prejudice the present occupiers of the Colonial-office, he must say that Africa had been the bête noir of the department. The unhealthiness of the climate and various other causes of that nature had militated in a great measure against the full development of the resources of the country immediately bordering upon the British settlements. Cape Coast Castle was one of the oldest, if not the oldest British settlement. It was instituted about 150 years ago, when England was a slaveholding power, for the purpose of enabling us to procure slaves to send to our settlements in America. It had been computed that before the slave-trade was done away with, we exported 590,000 slaves from the African coast to America, and we had thus incurred an enormous responsibility, which, as a Christian country, we were bound to make good in some way to that unfortunate people. Therefore the idea of giving up any of the settlements on the Coast would not, he thought, find favour in England, and he did not understand the mover of the committee to make any such suggestion. All he understood the right hon. gentleman to say was, that the present method of Government required inquiry, and that we must either increase our responsibilities by occupying and forming a colony of the protected territory, or we must reduce our responsibilities by limiting the area over which we now professed to exercise protection. The climate, the right hon. gentleman had stated, was notoriously unfit for the Anglo-Saxon race, and that was the reason why more had not been done there. It had been difficult to get men of a superior class to undertake the charge of government on that Coast, but he believed it would be quite possible to locate the Government officers on higher grounds. The same objection was made to Jamaica and our West Indian colonies till it was found out by going to the top of the hills the amount of sickness was very much reduced, and on the West Coast of Africa there were very high hills indeed, where a climate might be found in which the health of Englishmen would not suffer at all. We had been at a charge of 1,000,000l. to support the slave squadron; but he concurred with the right hon. gentleman that where there was a demand there would always eventually be found a supply. He thought it quite possible that England might be induced to make the protected territory into a colony which would be self-supporting, whereas at present we exercised little or no control over the native chiefs, and had done nothing by education beyond the voluntary efforts of missionaries, or by making roads for their cultivation. He did not mean to say that he was prepared to adopt that view at once, but inquiry might be made in that direction. There were others who thought it much better that we should give up the whole of the protected territories, and simply retain the forts as places where there might be stationed small executive governments and a few soldiers; but he did not think if we simply did that we should be exercising the same control over the slave-trade that we did now; whereas, if we made a colony of the protected territory, he believed the development of cotton, the growth of coffee and other things, would be brought into competition with the slave-grown produce of other countries, and would tend to reduce the value of slave labour. (Hear, hear.) So fully alive were the natives of Cape Coast Castle to the inquiry about to be instituted, that they had subscribed large sums for the purpose of sending over here witnesses of their own to place their case clearly before the committee. They would also have evidence from the Basle Missionary Society, whose exertions in behalf of the Africans he was glad to bear testimony to, especially in instruction in useful occupations, by means of which they were leading the natives much more willingly than societies which confined their operations to religious instruction would be able to do. It was unfortunate that in Gambia trade had been falling off. While the number of English vessels had considerably diminished, there had been a corresponding increase among the French. He thought it was a fit subject of inquiry as to whether our system of government had or had not in any way suppressed the energy of our merchants in trading to that country. There was no doubt we had on the Coast of Africa enormous resources, capable of supplying this country with raw material for our manufactures. He believed that last year we imported to England from Cape Coast Castle fifty tons of cotton of a superior kind. Therefore, by giving fair and proper encouragement to the trade, we should no doubt enable them to produce this superior article to enter into competition with slave-grown cotton. He could only further express a hope that the inquiry would lead to great results for the moral improvement of that part of Africa.

Upon the character of this region science has spent its speculations, and the exploration of it has been the hard work of ages. Africa, in fact, has been the world's huge problem. From Cæsar to Speke, the origin of the Nile has been mankind's greatest puzzle. Unsolved though it be, the attempts to trace it out have been of the greatest service. No longer esteemed a howling wilderness, or a death-stricken morass, the interior of Africa, from the southern border of Sahara down to our own limits, we know to be singularly fertile, and by no means insalubrious. The western shore, north of Walwisch Bay, gives ample evidence that a wealthy country lies beyond—a country rich in minerals and vegetation—blessed in all save the savage races that seal it up from the view of civilization. Going north, we find, near the equator, a tract of splendid hill-land, where the Cameroon Mountains reach to a height of 14,000 or 15,000 feet, and where the climate is so genial, that Captain Burton recommended its fitness for a penal settlement. Here we have come to the most remarkable part of the continent. Beyond the Cameroons extends that vast depression which intersects Africa, at a high altitude, from the equator to the Cape. Then, on the other side of the still unknown territory, we come to the wonderful lake-land, whose inland seas, fringed by the palm-growth of the tropics, are overshadowed by the snowy peaks, and embraced by the crescent arms of the mystic Mountains of the Moon. Here, in what may naturally be regarded as the hottest part of Africa, lying exactly across the equator, is a land which, according to Speke and Grant, is one of the finest in the world. Owing to its height above the sea-level, the climate is singularly pleasant, and is so far from being excessively hot, that Captain Grant walked through the whole of it in woollen clothing, and slept every night between blankets. 750 different specimens brought away by these travellers attest the abundance and variety of the vegetation there. All the necessaries and many luxuries of savage life grow without much effort, and the natives lead an easy and somewhat gluttonous existence, in the rank enjoyment of the many gifts of nature. From all we know, and that recent travellers have told us, the whole of East Africa, between Natal and the equator, bears the same character. Dr. Livingstone has found the cotton plant growing abundantly throughout the valleys and river plains north of the Zambezi. On this side of that river exists a country that is utterly unexplored as yet. On the map this region presents a blank, and a dotted line only marks the supposed course of the Limpopo as it goes to the sea. What is known of this tract, however, and by slow degrees it is being trenched upon, is altogether favourable. The large organised hunting stations which are now established in the Trans-Vaal, sending out yearly many detachments of trained hunters into the adjacent territories, are gradually opening up this darkly hid land, and we hear that recent hunters describe what they have seen of it in most glowing terms. They say that for beauty of aspect and natural fertility it exceeds any of the southern divisions, and the people of Moselekatsc, who rules as the emperor of it, are known to be in advance of the tribes on this side of them. Here, it must be remembered, is the ancient Sofala, presumed to be the Ophir referred to in the Bible, and to this day gold ornaments sometimes reach us through natives who have received them from that mysterious locality.

Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Even now our knowledge of them is very imperfect, their thorough exploration being impeded by climatic and physiographic influences. In a country, of which the greater part of the surface consists of swamps overgrown with mangrove forests, and which is rendered impenetrable by the luxuriance of the vegetation, geological and geographical studies are rendered all but impossible, whilst the absence of mountains prevents the traveller from obtaining a clear idea of the general configuration. The surface of the country presents a series of flat swampy plains, copiously watered by rivers and streams, and intersected by chains of hills gradually increasing in elevation as we recede from the sea-coast towards the interior, the said chains of hills being, very roughly, parallel to the average trend of the coast. Having regard to the large annual rainfall (about 60 in.), to the exceeding softness of the rocks, and the great sinuosities of the river, as well as to the general surface contour, no geologist can doubt that we have here a well marked example of a low plateau, from which hills have been produced simply by subaerial denudation, the harder portions having resisted the influence of the aqueous action which has worn the softer parts into hollows and valleys. In many cases, the hills owe their existence to a quartz reef which they enclose, and which has formed the backbone of the hill; a confirmation of this theory may be found in the fact that the northern slope of the hills is usually far steeper than the southern, the enclosed reef dipping to the south. The country rock is in most cases a non-stratified and but slightly indurated clay rock, resting upon soft blue slates, at times schistose; but in the present imperfect state of our geological knowledge of this region this statement must be regarded as conjectural rather than conclusive. The writer has never himself seen a single fossil that might aid in fixing the geological epoch of this formation, nor has he ever heard of such having been found, and is disposed to regard it as modern, geologically speaking. Round the bases of these low hillocks, and covering some of the more elevated plains, are deposits of non-consolidated gravels which are occasionally auriferous. These have been and are worked by the natives, especially on the banks of the smaller streams, tributaries of the river Ancobra, which intersects and forms the main highway of communication between the various gold mining concessions and the coast. Hitherto, none of these auriferous deposits have been found sufficiently rich to repay the attention which various European explorers have directed towards them, though there is no reason why such should not be discovered, especially towards the interior. The main wealth of the region lies in its deposits of gold quartz, which have been and are now worked by various mining companies. For the purpose of the present article these deposits may be classified under three distinct heads:—', 'last_edit_date': '1885-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.743, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD FIELDS OF WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Comparatively little is known of this great gold belt, although from time immemorial the Natives have won gold from alluvial deposits. It is believed that the Greeks received gold from these parts 2,900 years ago. Of recent times our first African traveller, Mungo Park, proved the existence of gold north of the Kong Mountain, and described the methods by which gold was won by the Natives; a plan similar to that adopted by the Natives south of the same range. The present gold supply comes from Ashanti, and possibly the bulk of it from Wassau. A little over 40 years ago our principal supply came from the Gold Coast; but when California and Australia came to the front as gold producers, the Gold Coast was to a great extent lost sight of. Since the first supply of gold in 1471, the total amount received from West Africa has been estimated by Captain Burton at £600,000,000, an amount not in the least exaggerated, I should say, when we take into account the regular yearly returns made for a period exceeding 200 years. Other authorities estimate that in the space of 40 years no less an amount than £200,000,000 could have been received. The surface soil in some parts of the country seems to be full of gold; it has been found on the sea beach, in rivers, and even washed from the gutters of the streets of the small towns after rain. Rich mines are found in Gaman and Wassau, the principal gold fields being on the Wassau range. Expeditions have been made from time to time, and quite recently discoveries are reported from the north-west part of the Colony. Such work is slow; the country is covered with dense forest, which makes progress in travelling and surface examinations difficult. As there is traditionally great wealth in the Kong mountains, it would seem wise to construct a line of rails through the country with the object of tapping this region. We are met with the suggestion that it would be a worthless undertaking from the point of trade. This, however, is problematic. There is the conviction that gold obtains abundantly in the interior, which could be confirmed; that there is produce or a country capable of producing it is certain.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-09-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_09_1893#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.746, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some of the Difficulties in the Way of Extending Trade in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The gold-mining industry, which it was hoped a few years ago would have done much for the colony, has not succeeded as it deserved, and that from many causes.

In the present famine of gold, it is very necessary that all sources of supply of the precious metal should be utilized; but until the conditions under which mining is pursued on the coast of Africa are fundamentally altered, the person who would invest money in the exploitation of gold mines would be very sanguine and would prove also very unfortunate.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen. The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.75, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West African Gold Mines', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The latest advices that we have seen from the Gold Coast Mining Company\'s works at Aboutyakoon state the health both of European and African labourers to be really good.

We had hoped ere this to have had to announce large returns in gold to the African Gold Coast Company, commonly called the French Company, because, as we stated in our last, this company had a large quantity of rich ore at bank, had erected its stampers, and commenced stamping. Some necessary precautions, however, seem to have been omitted, and a great portion of the gold stamped was, it appears, borne away upon or in the water. It seems to us inexplicable that gold should thus have been allowed to run away to waste, and the realization of the just expectations of the shareholders been thus postponed. It was always known that the gold, which is exceedingly pure, was in very fine particles, and that special means would be required to bring it all into the...\n\ncoffers of the company. Why these should not have been taken at and from the first, we are at a loss to conceive. That they will now be taken (indeed, we are informed that they may now be considered as already in use at the company's mines) is, of course, beyond doubt; and we may hope, therefore, to be able in our next to state that full success has attended their employment, and that the gold is arriving in Europe. Meanwhile, if our information be correct, the shareholders of the French Company are so fully convinced, by preliminary results obtained, of the exceeding value of the Wassaw mines that they have subscribed, at a premium, all the shares of a new company, affiliated to the original one, for working a special mine, on which operations have not yet commenced. As we observed in our last that it would not be for lack of rich gold quartz if profitable results were not speedily obtained, so we would say it will not be from any scarcity of gold in the new mine if the justifiable hopes and expectations of the shareholders are not realized. This new company—which, it is understood, will commence working immediately, having, as in the case of the Gold Coast Mining Company's property of Abboutyakoon, a shaft open to the depth of about seventy feet, and similarly a rich ore-bed there attained—will make the fifth European enterprise in operation in and near Tacquah. Our preliminary desires as regards that country are thus being gradually accomplished. There are a certain number of people becoming convinced that gold is there in abundance, and there are a certain number determined that, as the gold is there, it shall be got—that commerce and industry shall not pine in Europe because the gold fields of California and Australia have diminished in their yield nearly one-half—viz., from 35,000,000l. a-year to 19,000,000l.—while there is a gold field in West Africa that, if properly worked, can supply all the deficiency."", 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WEST AFRICAN GOLD MINES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""M.

Bonnat, who had been three years resident in Tacquah at the mines, and we cannot help being much impressed by the result. We may truly say he shows no trace of deterioration by climate. He says it is a vile climate, and requires great prudence, caution, self-restraint, and watchfulness on the part of Europeans residing there; but he agrees with our view that as the country becomes disforested by mining operations, the climate will improve. That, although dangerous, it is not necessarily fatal, is proved by the fact that although there are thirteen Europeans on the staff of the French Company, there has not been a case of death, save of one man who literally and deliberately killed himself. This is gratifying, as it points, we think and hope, to a not distant time when climate will scarcely have to be at all taken into account in our calculations. We would not have our readers form the erroneous idea that all the gold formations in the West African gold fields are precisely of the same character as those of Tacquah and Abosso. We do not yet know how much further north that peculiar formation may extend, but in the line from and including the French Company's Abosso mine, mentioned in our last, and one or two concessions N.N.W. of that, the formation seems clearly to have been in the course of some old river-bed, and the gold-bearing veins or lodes are of disintegrated quartz, in scarcely any of which does gold appear to the naked eye, even when the assay has been as high as thirty-three to thirty-four ounces of gold to the ton of ore. This formation extends, as we have said, from the N.N.W. points above indicated through the Tacquah district, including Aboutuyakoon, the Gold Coast Mining Company's mines, those of the African Gold Coast Company, those of the Effuenta Company, and the Tamsoo and Merivoo Mines to the River Bonza, and in a direct line S.S.W. toward the sea-coast. This line does not include, we believe, the mines being worked or about to be worked by Messrs. F. and A. Swanzy, which are on a hill outside it. Glorious specimens have, we believe, as stated in an earlier number, been taken from this mine, but, according to description (we have not personally seen them), they are of gold-bearing, hard, natural quartz, not disintegrated quartz, approaching in character to that of the East India mines now in such great favour, on which beautiful deposits of gold from time to time appear, very striking to the eye when compared with the disintegrated quartz lodes, with their invisible though rich continuous gold. We think it right to mention this essential difference, not that we have any reason to believe the high expectations formed of the gold yield of that natural quartz will in any way disappoint the high expectations formed of it, because we have the firm conviction that this quartz in West Africa is ten times richer than that to be found in any of the so-much-boasted-of East Indian mines.

Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast. By 1914 all countries had experienced a decade of appreciable growth.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Minerals', 'content': ""The substantial contribution of minerals to the export sector could mislead us into exaggerating their contribution to the general wealth. But the limited nature of African participation should guide our assessment. Mining was established with foreign capital, and profits accruing from the industry were repatriated to swell the pockets of shareholders abroad, or to develop economies outside Africa. For instance, when the Charter of the Niger Company was revoked in 1899, the company was compensated £150000 for its mining rights in the region where tin mining was later established. According to the same agreement, the company was to receive as much as 50% of all royalties from mining for ninety-nine years.$^{59}$ This was a very heavy price for the local population to pay, but the situation was even worse in the Rhodesias, where mining rights remained in the hands of the British South Africa Company until 1933 when they were purchased by the state for £2 000 000.$^{60}$ But even after this change the local population was rarely regarded, and even more rarely treated, as the beneficiaries of mining operations. As late as 1942, a high-ranking official in the British Colonial Office shamelessly placed on record that 'there is particularly little reason for reserving the value of the mineral product to the local inhabitants when those inhabitants have done nothing to develop it'.$^{61}$ But even where the colonial administrations nationalized minerals, as was the case in Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, little revenue, mainly from royalties and income tax, was realized. In Sierra Leone direct revenue from minerals in 1935 was £34100, which was only 5% of total revenue. 62 Wages remained the only way by which the local population could have acquired a substantial portion of the proceeds from mining, but, as was the case in settler and plantation agriculture, they were kept so low that wage earners had to be subsidized by the peasant sector. Racial discrimina› tion was an important guiding line in this issue.$^{63}$ European employees were paid many times the amount paid to African employees, even for similar tasks. Africans were rarely taught important skills which would increase their productivity and, subsequently, their incomes.

Neither the worker nor the peasant was a beneficiary of colonial economic relations, but the former experienced worse exploitation. The appropriation of the surplus by international capital is revealed by the backwardness and general poverty of the dependencies during the mid-i930S. Colonial administrators attempted, often feverishly, to arrest the increasing deterioration of soil fertility, especially in the native reserves where population pressure threatened land productivity, by restricting African cultivation.

No one suggested, for example, that minerals should not be mined because they could never be replaced.$^{114}$ And mining, generally considered to be a modern sector, contributed only marginally to industrial life. As a matter of fact, mining thrived on the peasant sector by paying workers starvation wages. The economic features which were established during the period under discussion have, in most cases, persisted to the post-independence era.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'By the second decade of the present century the British had firmly estab› lished themselves in many parts of tropical Africa including Nigeria, Gold Coast (now Ghana), The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Nyasaland (now Malawi), Uganda, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa (see Fig. 2.1) and the colonial economies were clearly taking shape. This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'As an eminent economist has pointed out, \'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically. Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

Production for subsistence had been well-developed long before colonial rule, and it received only negligible attention from the colonial authorities. Plantains, yams, cassava, rice and maize were produced by West African peasants with the very simple technology which the British met at the end of the nineteenth century. Things were not different in the production of bananas, maize, cassava, millet, and a variety of other crops in East and Central Africa. In an average year most families produced enough for home consumption and put a small amount into the exchange sector. But to both the official and unofficial agents of imperialism, the subsistence sector was of little interest as it did not directly promote the interests of international capital. Unlike the export sector, it did not earn the badly needed foreign currency with which to pay for imports, nor did it provide raw materials to feed the factories of the metropolis.

This was the failure of the assimilationist or direct administration policy which was the vogue in the nineteenth century. Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

Arrests were made and fines imposed by chiefs to maintain the hold-up. The effectiveness of the movement threatened the very foundation of colonial economic relations, as the colonial govern› ment, like the expatriate firms, depended on the cocoa trade for its revenue. Evidently the movement was against the interests of both sides. Accord› ingly, the colonial administration broke the movement by force, fining and imprisoning chiefs who supported the hold-up.$^{80}$ During the 1937/8 cocoa season another big hold-up was staged against the most important cocoa exporting firms which had formed an agreement to buy cocoa at a fixed maximum price. This time, the hold-up was extended to Western Nigeria, and it ended only with the intervention of the British government. A commission of enquiry headed by Nowell$^{81}$ revealed that the marketing system, which involved thousands of intermediaries, was both inefficient and wasteful, and was disadvantageous to both the producers in West Africa and the consumers in Western Europe.\nThe United Africa Company (UAC), an amalgamation of many former British firms, was the most prominent and most powerful firm in West African trade after 1920. It alone handled nearly half of West Africa's overseas trade during the 1930s, and dominated British West Africa, 82 especially Nigeria.

There was an overall revival of coercion in economic relations, indicating that the colonial economy had to be buttressed by non-economic means when in crisis. African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported. However, in East Africa the 'Asian' merchants were essential for keeping the money economy intact and avoiding reversion to barter, just as their capital had been the original basis for the extension of specie and small-scale money exchanges throughout the region.$^{16}$ In the final analysis, therefore, the British administration co-operated to protect the interests of these retailers and produce buyers.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

The National Congress of British West Africa also declared: That the policy of the Congress shall be to maintain strictly and in› violate the connection of the British West African Dependencies with the British Empire, and to maintain unreservedly all and every right of free citizenship of the Empire and the fundamental principle that taxation goes with effective representation ... to aid in the develop› ment of the political institutions of British West Africa under the Union Jack ... and, in time, to ensure within her borders the Govern› ment of the people by the people for the people; to ensure equal opportunity for all, to preserve the lands of the people for the people.

It may be a matter of very little consequence to England whether the natives of these protected territories shall continue in the same hopeless state in which they have been up to this time; but it is important to us that they should not. It seems to us that the Constitution, which was made here by the Fanti Confederation ten months ago, does not in any way encroach upon the legitimate action of the British Government, as sovereign protector of these countries. What the Confederation purposes to do under that Constitution, then, is just what the British authorities have never attempted to do, and could not do by themselves if they were ever so much disposed to do it, and really tried to do it, which is not at all likely ever to take place, unless we have a class of officials very different to that we have been cursed with for a long while past. We know that we are a very insignificant people in British eyes; the officials set over us on the Coast by the British Government never cease in their efforts to make us understand that we are, in their point of view, the ""very off-scouring of all things,"" only fit to drink the quantity of rum and gin sufficient that the duties they make us pay upon it shall be enough to provide for their salaries and plunder. It is true that the great mass of our people are in this unhappy state; and surely, Mr. Editor, it is natural that this should fret us who have passed out of this stage, and understand something of what the African mind is capable of, if pains be taken to pull it out of the deep and slimy mire of superstitious barbarism. It was because this did fret us, and does fret us, that some of us who know a little about the blessings that come through education and progress, have given up so much of our time and exerted ourselves so much to bring the kings and chiefs and head men to see these things as we see them. It was not a small effort, Mr. Editor; nobody could so thoroughly understand the difficulties in our way as we did; and those of us who have happily learned to know God could not help believing that His blessing was with our work, or we could not have had so much success in it as we have had. And we thought, whatever might be the opposition of British officials out here, who, for their own selfish ends, would like to keep things as they are, that the British Government would hold out the hand to us, and encourage us when we showed them in the Constitution—which, as you have justly said, was to Administrator Salmon like a red flag to a furious bull—what were the objects we had in view, and had brought the kings and chiefs to agree with, and desire just as we did. Instead of this, here we are just as we were months ago. We have not had any real answer from London, and have to bear a great deal because of it. It strikes us as the more strange because we are still told that the British Government intends to take away all the West Indian soldiers next year, and leave their officials to do the best they can without them. Now there can be no doubt they might do very well without them if they would accept the co-operation that the Fanti Confederation has offered and asked for by its Constitution, and by the mouths of its persecuted officials, when they saw and were so well received by the Governor-in-Chief, Mr. Pope Hennessy; but we do not see how they can prudently take away all their troops, and at the same time pour contempt upon this native organization, and persecute it and reject it. We hope you will try and do all you can for us to bring the Government to a proper frame of mind about it.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The Department not only refused to move on its own account, but threw every obstacle in the way of private enterprise. In 1874 negotiations were opened up between the French and English Governments, the object of which was to exchange our commercially flourishing settlements on the Gambia for some worthless concessions by the French to the westward of the Gold Coast. So strong, however, was the pressure brought to bear upon the Government of the day, in 1875, by an influential committee formed in London, the Royal Colonial Institute, and various religious and philanthropic societies, that the project was abandoned, and, it was hoped, finally. The hope proved illusory. The authorities at the Colonial Office withdrew the protection hitherto enjoyed by British traders on the Upper Gambia, until in despair they abandoned the struggle with the Government at home and prepared themselves to accept any authority that would guarantee them security to trade. It was to this condition things had come when the Gambia was thrown open to all comers.\n\nNot only is the whole basin of the Upper Niger now French territory, but their agents are pushing up the river from Bamakou to its sources, and making exclusive treaties with the chiefs. On all these streams there are French trading posts, which in a very brief period will join hands with those of the interior; and so, without the firing of a shot, French influence and trade will have supplanted and superseded that of England on ground held by her adventurers and traders since 1620. With the Portuguese settlements on the Casamance and Rio Grande there will be little difficulty in dealing; in reality, they are already practically French possessions. Having pointed out the shrinkage of territory imminent on the West Coast, it would not be difficult to show how ""manifest destiny"" will in time bring French influence from the north down to our settlements on the Gold Coast. There is no need, however, to follow the subject further for the present.

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated.

This may be the reason that, with very rare exceptions, the Government officials on that coast are inimical to any efforts of enterprising private persons to develop the resources of that province; yea, even often go so far as to do their utmost to prevent and impede private enterprise, and with a puerile fear unworthy the English nation, hasten to inform, officially, the kings and chiefs that such and such attempt was undertaken by a private individual, and that the Government had not the least interest in it.

He reminded his hearers that England once had a free hand, and did not profit by her opportunities. The Gambia is among the oldest English colonies. It commands the mouth of a navigable waterway, along which England's authority might have spread over the whole interior. From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding. Not much better things can be said of the settlement of Sierra Leone. Its confines might have been expanded to take in the Upper Niger, which has its sources not far from the Sierra Leone boundary. At one time it was practicable to conciliate the friendship of the Mahommedan chief, Samadu, who has been building up an empire inland. The chance was postponed, and now Samadu has placed his kingdom under the protection of France. The colony of Lagos is the sole plantation at which Mr. Johnston can glance without vexation. There, though the Government delays to move the front of the harbour, and though official supineness is answerable for the interposition of wedges of foreign territory between Lagos and the Gold Coast, the spirit of English enterprise is seen.

For the development of their material resources, and consequently for their general progress, they have need of an element which does not exist per se, but must be created or imported. This element is wealth; and wealth is the realized surplus product of industry after the supply of the wants of those employed in it. In some British colonies a portion of the realized surplus in the mother country is brought in for stimulating development, either in the shape of resources belonging to immigrants, who may come in to occupy the lands, or Imperial expenditure, or moneys lent from England directly to colonists, upon security of their lands and houses, or through their Governments, on security of their general or particular resources, as revenues, colonial lands, &c. And the rapid development of some of those colonies has been greatly assisted by capital thus introduced. But the British possessions on the West Coast of Africa, not being available for British emigrants, have very little chance of the aid of British capital in any of the above ways, except, perhaps, as loans on the security of their revenues. For this, however, there must be a surplus revenue for payment of interest and redemption; and in advocating a wise economy in the Local Government expenditure, we have always had in view the creation of such a surplus of public revenue. We, then, look upon every act of official jobbery and extravagance by which the revenue is plundered and unnecessarily consumed, as being an attack upon the vital interests of the native population of those settlements. It is necessary to look the African financial question directly in the face. In the present and, so far as we can perceive, the prospective temperament of British politicians as regards West Africa, there is no chance of any Imperial expenditure there on those public works which are absolutely indispensable to a rapid development of material resources; no immigrants are likely to come in bringing realized capital with them; and it will be only after a large expenditure of capital that lands, even in British West African possessions, will be considered to offer such a security as to induce the loan of British capital upon them. From this it follows that if West Africa is to progress, it must be chiefly, if not entirely, by means of her own resources. In other words, there must be a creation of native capitalists. And the time has arrived at which this creation ought to take place. But it never can take place while the realized surplus product of industry goes out of the country. That realized surplus, which, in the infancy of trade and resources, went almost inevitably into the hands of the British merchant and trader, and has thus been lost to the country, must now be kept at home; for it is on the keeping it at home in the hands of natives that a rapid progress in Africa absolutely depends. That surplus, we say, which hitherto has, by some means or other, found its way into the hands of the British merchants, traders, and European agents, must in future be kept as much as possible in the hands of the native traders and producers. The question is, how is this to be accomplished. It must be done partly by them and partly for them. They must exercise prudence, self-restraint and self-denial, as well as industry and intelligence; and they must be aided in England by zeal and faithfulness, and the most strict and scrupulous honesty in every dealing with them.

And the time is now specially favourable for this. The temporary paralysis which afflicts many branches of British industry, and thus affects the well-being of many millions of the community, has led to attention being more than heretofore directed to the dormant resources of many lands, with a view to an increase in the demand for British manufactures. One result of this has been that Africa—uncivilized, undeveloped Africa—has grown into estimation in quarters where the possibility of any good thing coming out of it was formerly regarded as the mere day-dreams of peculiar enthusiasts. The breath of life seems to have been breathed upon the dry bones of African enterprise; we hear on every hand of embryo projects—many of them, it is true, very vague and wild, but others that only require, for successful realization, a renewed application of those means and energies which in other time led to the foundation of our Indian Empire, and which, in the very teeth of Government indifference, and quasi, when not active and open, opposition, dotted the face of the earth with colonies, now our pride and glory; and even the Secretary of State for the Colonies has pointed to Central Africa as holding in reserve a wondrous wealth for British merchants and manufacturers. He did not say, however, that Government would actively assist in putting ""the salt upon the tail"" of this rich and beautiful bird. He only thought, as we think, that it is within the power of British enterprise to effect it, if it so choose. It is a result greatly to be desired. One of our many anxieties, however, is that this attractive interior should not shut out our West Africa from view; and for this we desire to keep constantly before the Government and the public what she is, what she wants, and the rewards she offers; to show especially what it is the absolute duty of the British authorities to do; having, as we have, the absolute certainty that at every step they take in the path of progress, private enterprise will go with them and give them speedy results, such as will justify and encourage them to proceed, and open new fields to commerce, civilization, and Christianity.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1879#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'West Africa is one of the richest mineral regions on the planet, and England has been given an entrance to it for the purpose of spreading a civilisation and Christianity that will not do harm to the cause of the Gospel or bring disgrace on morality.

Why have we not been in Bambara years ago? A light railway should have been run up to the north-east. The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers.

This illusion is being rapidly dispelled by disinterested travellers. The Englishman, through unhealthy habits, may dig his own grave even in England, as so many thousands do annually. Besides, were London as innocent of sanitary arrangements as Freetown, it would soon become the white man\'s grave in grim reality. A man unaddicted to drink and gluttony may live, and does live, an enjoyable life in West Africa; he enjoys it so much that, like Emin Pasha, he refuses to be rescued.

Some of these vegetable products grow wild. Horses, camels, and sheep, can be bred in the north-east. The list of articles to be found on the coast reads like the inventory of a Liverpool warehouse.

That there is a great future in store for the Negro peoples no one can deny, who sees how they alone of all the aboriginal races are able to hold their own face to face with the Caucasian, and to increase in ever-growing ratio—like the Israelites of old—in spite of all efforts to cripple them and bind them down, as we see at present in the vaunted Republic of the Western World.

In the present famine of gold, it is very necessary that all sources of supply of the precious metal should be utilized; but until the conditions under which mining is pursued on the coast of Africa are fundamentally altered, the person who would invest money in the exploitation of gold mines would be very sanguine and would prove also very unfortunate.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE EFFECT', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'THE EFFECT of the lately popular laissez-faire policy of the Government with regard to the British colonies and settlements in West Africa is beginning to make itself most unpleasantly realised. For months past it has been pointed out that the French and other European nations were gradually bearing in upon the irregularly defined boundaries of our authority towards the interior; and now the constriction of the annexation band which the recent settlements of the French have completed around the eastern and northern limits of the British sphere in West Africa is beginning to be most painfully felt upon our trade and intercourse with the interior. From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia. The Governor has investigated the circumstances attending the hauling-down of the Union Jack at two stations in the interior. In one case it was found that the district was distinctly under British protection; the other was about ""forty yards outside the British limit."" Doubtless, this is a near thing; but the rule the French, with the rest of our rivals, are in the habit of applying is, that ground which cannot be proved to belong to us must belong to them.

In the absence of rivals, the course has been comparatively clear; and it seems difficult for Governments to realise that all this has been changed during the last two decades. If we would maintain the Empire which has been handed down to us by the enterprise and enthusiasm of the last nine generations, it can only be done by a ready recognition of the fact that other nations around us are only too eager to circumvent our plans, and to take advantage of every slip and inaction on our part.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1893#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West African Hinterlands', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In this country it has been found that many things which the Government could not undertake become practicable in the hands of a chartered company under Government ægis. The French have at last caught on to this idea. Some time ago the Paris *Figaro* printed a special supplement solely devoted to West African affairs, and mainly of the character of a prospectus of the ""Black India Company"" of France. The work cut out for that company is to make one whole of Algeria, of Senegal, and of the Congo, by the Touareg Sahara, and by the Central and Western Soudan, and by penetration towards the regions of Lake Tchad. There can be no doubt that this is a very ambitious scheme. The capital required is estimated at 400,000,000 francs, but while it is admitted that this is a vast sum for a country that has been much tried and has not much enterprise, it is also pointed out that relatively to the results which would be forthcoming, it is a small investment. Perhaps those who cry ""African Panama"" will control the situation, but that remains to be seen. The intense energy and restless activity of France in colonial matters is a fact which can no longer be doubted, and there are many other recent events besides the occurrences in the hinterland of Sierra Leone which should kindle afresh the old spirit in Great Britain. There are being laid before the newspaper readers on the other side of the English Channel day by day the most minute details of the character and extent of the products which it is proposed that France should make her own.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary.

Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.
