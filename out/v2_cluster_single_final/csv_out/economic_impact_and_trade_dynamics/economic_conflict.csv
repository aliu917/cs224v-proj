75,"The perilous nature of early European maritime trade and exploration in Africa is underscored by the numerous deaths and hardships faced by traders, sailors, and local merchants due to inadequate safety measures and harsh conditions.","The perilous nature of early European maritime trade and exploration in Africa is underscored by numerous accounts of deaths and hardships faced by traders, sailors, and local merchants due to inadequate safety measures and harsh conditions. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the high mortality rates among laborers and traders, attributing these to exposure to new diseases, inadequate sanitary conditions, and harsh working environments. For instance, it notes the death rate of 100 per thousand among indentured laborers in Sao Tomé and Principe in 1915 and describes the dangerous conditions faced by European explorers, such as Mungo Park's death in a canoe accident on the Niger River. However, the text focuses more on the broader impact of European contact on African societies, including the spread of diseases and disruption of local economies, rather than specifically on the inadequacy of safety measures for European traders and sailors. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide vivid examples of the dangers faced by European traders and sailors, such as the death of Captain Tracey and his crew, the fever outbreak on Her Majesty's ship Isis, and the capsizing of the boat from the barque Guiding Star, which resulted in shark attacks and deaths. The articles also highlight the unhealthy conditions in places like Sierra Leone, where trade was nearly suspended due to sickness, and the challenges faced by explorers like Emil Holub. Despite these hardships, the articles note some improvements over time, such as better health conditions in certain trading stations and evolving trade practices, suggesting a gradual mitigation of some risks. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view that supports the claim, illustrating the significant risks and hardships encountered during early European trade and exploration in Africa, while also acknowledging some progress in addressing these challenges.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding the perilous nature of early European maritime trade and exploration in Africa.

In revenge for this the traders, five years prior to our arrival, had resolved to 'tengeneze' the native (make them behave). For this purpose a combined caravan of some 1,500 men stationed at Kwa-Sundu [later Mumia] was marched upon them. Dividing into sections, they entered the district at different points, and crossed it, devastating every village on the way, killing thousands of men and women, committing the most horrible atrocities, such as ripping up women with child, making great bonfires and throwing children into them, while the small boys and girls were captured as slaves. 20 Most of the other people of the north-central interior of East Africa were less affected by this international trade. They had less direct or even indirect dealings with the foreigners from the coast; in fact in many cases they were unwilling to welcome these foreigners into their societies, although they were willing to sell foodstuffs to caravans on the stopping stations.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Europe still went in fear of the corsairs of the Maghrib. If Neapolitan sailing ships were making for the coast and caught sight of a Tunisian or Tripolitanian flag, their crews were quick to make their escape.

In 1800, Tunisian ships arrived in Malta and in 1809 in Leghorn. The dey's government in Algeria did very profitable business selling wheat. The trade and shipping conditions laid down by the Maghribian states aroused intense annoyance in Europe. Algeria, Tunisia and Tripolitania levied tribute and obliged friendly countries to pay for the free passage of their ships on the basis of peace and maritime navigation treaties.

Lugard laid much stress on this, claiming that Nigeria's more deserted areas were evidence of periodic devastation.$^{48}$ Certainly there was some insecurity in pre-colonial Africa, as is evidenced by the defensive location of many villages from which 'downhill movements' of farmers to better agricultural locations occurred after their safety could be guaranteed. 49 The claim of greater security was true in the long run but highly questionable during the first decades.

What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle. Examples include the thousands killed in Senegal in 1886 when opposing the building of a railway$^{51}$ and in the Ndebele war in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1893, the long-drawn-out suppression of the BÆtetela rebellion in the Congo Free State from 1895 to 1907, and a series of episodes in German South West Africa (now Namibia) between 1901 and 1906.

[had been] engaged in a process of relatively autonomous development, tied to the European world in a limited but important manner through the intermediary of merchants or state trading agents on each side ... Yet in 1879 this whole structure began to crumble, and by 1900 it had ceased to exist.' With the imposition of colonial rule, 'the characteristic link between Africans and Europeans was no longer that between trading partners ... The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance. Hopkins warns us not to imagine that Niger delta traders like Nana Olomu were forerunners of nationalism or spokesmen for popular griev› ances, pointing out that their 'vision of social justice did not include the emancipation of their own slaves'. Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'African reactions', 'content': ""Between 1787 and 1807, i.e. in the period immediately preceding abolition by the West, more than a million Africans were transported to the Americas.

Indecisiveness by the abolitionists left Portugal and Brazil to carry on the illicit trade south of the Equator at their leisure, and exportation was sometimes as high as in the eighteenth century. Though seriously combated after 1842, the trade did not die out on the Loango Coast until the end of the century.$^{24}$ North of the Equator, extension of the abolition order to the European settlements brought about the closure of traditional trading centres in Senegambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Gold Coast.

On the whole, coastal areas had had a longer contact with Europeans and Arabs than the interior areas. Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': ""On the eve of the 'Scramble'"", 'content': ""lend itself to a unified struggle against the Europeans.

In the first instance they were particularly vulnerable to external pressures, as suggested by the willingness of the Afro-Portuguese and Chikunda to serve as Lisbon's imperial agents.

Thus, under the colonial system, Africans were in most cases made to produce what they did not consume and to consume what they did not produce, clear evidence of the lopsided and exploitive nature of the colonial economy. In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants. African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions"", 'content': 'The situation of the Africans, always precarious, became in 1930 as tragic as it had been at the beginning of the period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 22, 'article_title': 'West Coast of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'West Coast of Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-1', 'issue_date': '22_11_1862', 'content': 'The Royal Mail steamship Armenian arrived at Liverpool, with the above mails, on the 11th inst., and also brought 1,928 ounces of gold-dust, 525 dollars, and 3,131 francs.\n\nAlarm had been caused at Cape Coast Castle by a mutiny amongst the soldiers of the Gold Coast Artillery.

I have thought a concise description of the premises, and the multifarious purposes to which they are appropriated, would not be uninteresting to many of your readers. The description may amuse some—only a select few, I trust; displease others—those who should hide their heads for very shame, and not stir up their choler; shock the nerves of many—yourself amongst others, the intelligent public, and readers of the African Times in general. I shall not indulge in any criticism, or make any comments. I leave that to you, Mr. Editor. I shall give you a description ""veluti in speculum"" as in a looking-glass—\n\n""Nothing extenuate or aught set down in malice.""\n\nGothic House was built during the years 1843-4-5 by the late Mr. Thomas Hutton, a native of Cape Coast, and an intelligent, enterprising, and energetic merchant. He lost his valuable life at Lagos in the month of October, 1856, by the upsetting of a boat on his passage from the shore to one of the mail steamers of that day, with a view to return to Cape Coast.\n\nGothic House has a very imposing appearance on the exterior; but the inside, so far as regards the needful for a comfortable or convenient residence, is very deficient in arrangement. There are four large halls. One is used as an office for the Custom-house clerks, with one end with a bow window partitioned off as a post-office; another hall is the office of the colonial secretary and collector of customs; the third is the entrance-hall, and has one end of it partitioned off as an office for the first clerk of the Customs; the fourth large hall contains the Colonial-office and Custom-house records. In addition to these, there are on the first floor two other small rooms, one used as a stationery depot for the Colonial and Customs Departments, the other as a dispensary and surgery for the colonial surgeon; and at the extreme back there are three other small rooms, occupied by the gaoler and the first turnkey. So much for the first-floor arrangements. On the second floor are three smaller rooms, which are occupied by the colonial secretary and collector of customs. These two appointments for some three or four years past have been merged into one, and, consequently, only represented by one person.

On the 12th the wind began to blow from the south, but no notice was taken of it, as no one thought it would increase in force. About 2.30 p.m. a gale set in so violent that it drove the schooner Osprey into the break of the waves rolling on to the beach, and it became clear that she must run ashore. At a few minutes to five she struck. The rocket apparatus belonging to the English residents was in readiness, and in a few minutes the crew of five persons were on shore. After the Osprey struck the weather seemed to moderate. At midnight the steamer Benguela, from Liverpool with mails, anchored. The steamer Iceland, for the Cape of Good Hope, came into the bay, but in consequence of the threatening appearance of the weather the captain prudently kept to sea. At 2.30 a.m. on the 13th the wind and the rain increased in violence. The night was pitch-dark, and the wind was blowing fearfully. The Custom-house officers were on the beach with lighted torches. Shortly after three o\'clock the brigantine Maurice struck. The crew were all saved. Just as the last man was brought on shore the Portuguese cutter Moura ran aground close to the Maurice. All the crew of this vessel were also saved except one man, the cook, who was washed away. While these two vessels were occupying the attention of everybody—for the firing of the distress guns had induced a large number of people to come to the shore—the American brigantine, Nellie Clifford, was observed to be drifting in with the breakers. The masts were cut away, but this did not save the vessel, for soon after she was struck by a huge sea, and carried gradually to close where the two other vessels that had been wrecked lay. As soon as she came near enough a line was passed to her, and the crew saved. A Portuguese Customs officer would not leave the cabin, which was on deck, and which the sea ultimately carried away. The man must have been drowned. Whilst the crew of the vessel were being saved, the Barbosa ran ashore close to the three other vessels, and those on board were rescued in less than five minutes. Day was now breaking, and a schooner, the Swiftsure, with a general cargo from Liverpool, was seen to drag, but, to the surprise of everybody, she succeeded in holding on till about nine a.m., when all danger was over. A Mr. Platt came in with a party of friends on board his steam yacht Norseman, and everybody thought she would run on shore, but they managed to anchor securely at about five a.m. Our correspondent says: ""It is a great shame that the Government here have nothing to save life with; there are no ropes to be got; no anything. All depends on the English residents."" As to the condition of the wrecked vessels, our correspondent reports that the Osprey and the Barbosa are whole, but that the others are damaged. On the morning of his writing the Swiftsure was towed out to a place of safety. Her cargo is much injured, but otherwise she is all right. The captain of the Benguela asked 500l. to tow her to sea.

The men scrambled on to the bottom, and rapidly drifted out to sea, which was swarming with sharks. Two of the men in sheer despair tried to swim to the ship, but were seized by sharks and disappeared, whilst the others remained on the boat, under a tropical sun, for three days, during which they suffered great agony. One man, who succumbed, was eaten by sharks, and the survivors abandoned the boat and endeavoured to reach the shore by swimming.

Herr Holub and his wife, who had accompanied him, with great difficulty succeeded in making their escape, and he has recently sent to the _Neue Freie Presse_ an interesting account of the catastrophe. He says that he had, after great difficulty, succeeded in reaching the territory of the Maschukulumbe. In this part of Africa it is impossible to obtain porters who are willing to give their services for the whole of the journey. The negroes are unwilling to leave the territory of their own tribe, and, as the villages are independent and often in a state of open hostility with their neighbours, it is necessary to change porters three or four times a day. Some men whom Herr Holub had engaged from the Matokas left him as soon as the expedition had reached the territory of the Maschukulumbe. They feared an attack from this tribe, which Herr Holub regards as the very scum of the negro race. When he reached the country to the north of Suenge he had lost half of his 70 bales of goods. He determined to rest a little in this region. Some of the Maschukulumbe informed him that a Portuguese trader was within a few hours' march, and that he would do well to go and meet him and make arrangements for reaching the Mankvu territory. Herr Holub, leaving his encampment in charge of two blacks who had remained faithful to him, and of two white men, Messrs. Fehete and Sollner, started to meet this Portuguese trader, but when he had gone some distance and could hear no tidings of him he began to suspect he had been betrayed, and hurried back to his encampment. On the way back he met Herr Fehete and the two blacks, who had fled from the encampment, which had been attacked during his absence and Herr Sollner killed. The small band, finding it impossible to return to the encampment, had to travel 400 miles in order to reach the Zambesi, without any baggage or ammunition, and Herr Holub had lost all his equipments and the natural history collections which he had got together at so much cost and labour. After enduring terrible privations he and his scanty band of followers succeeded in reaching the territory of the Matokas, not being able at last to march more than seven miles a day. Herr Holub was suffering from fever, and, to make matters worse, the King of the Matokas at first received him very badly at Mapanze, and refused to give him any assistance. But he changed his mind, and so Herr Holub was able to continue his route, and soon after, at the mouth of the River Tchobe, he got news of the presence of three English travellers, from whom he obtained further relief and whom he asked to forward to Europe this narrative of his sufferings."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1887#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WHAT CAN BE DONE IN AFRICA?', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Of all the trading stations or British settlements on the West Coast of Africa, Lagos, the latest born of the latter, seemed to be the most fatal to European life.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber.

In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die.

The article in question says:—\n\nOne of the ways in which the development of trade must be carried out is by pushing factories up beyond the tribes who now serve as middlemen between the European trader and the native producer. Some difficulty will no doubt be encountered in passing through the unhealthy and malarious districts in which these middlemen live, but the improved knowledge we are obtaining of how to combat climatic diseases will render such an enterprise more easy than it would have been twenty years ago. Indeed, if we contrast the early reports of the Niger with its present exploitation, we may believe that the climate of no tropical country will permanently prevent its being opened up to commerce. This is a ray of hope for our African traders, and it is to be hoped that our Government will enable them to avail themselves of it speedily, and not allow them to be forestalled by the merchants of other nations. As if the inaction of our Government had not been sufficiently disastrous to the trade of the African merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, the home legislation of the last few years has also done much to hamper their enterprise. One industry alone, which, though it may be considered a small one, came in the aggregate to a considerable amount, has been completely driven out of the country. The trade in matches to the West Coast used to be supplied by Manchester. Now, the children who used to be employed in their manufacture are sent to school hungry, while German matches are sent in German ships to those who used to buy the English ones, and the only profit to English people is that of the middleman, and even that is being rapidly taken from them.\n\nThe German and French textile manufactures are also running us close, and we have to watch carefully the change of fashions and ideas among the natives. Many cheap articles made in France, with a ready sale on the coast, could easily be made in England.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Such termini were centres of active transactions.\nA system of this type was characterized by increasingly marked contrasts between areas that monopolized profitable operations - centralization of large quantities of products, handling and marketing operations - and those where there were fewer opportunities to accumulate wealth. The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century. On the whole, the Atlantic slave trade, even the clandestine operations, died out in the course of the 1850s, although in the lower Zaire river area it survived outside Portuguese control until the disappearance of the last of the slave markets in Latin America towards the end of the i86os.\nDuring the remainder of the century, exports from Angola were limited to a few agricultural products (such as coffee and sugar) and especially, products obtained by gathering - mostly wax and ivory - though during the last three decades of the century a greater variety of exported products were gathered, such as wild coffee, copal, palm oil and, later, more import¬ antly, natural rubber."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': ""The roots of the social problems in the delta states may be traced to the difficulties the ruling groups faced in changing from an economy based on the slave trade to one based on palm produce.

A switch meant changing old trade habits and methods, and dealing with a new set of white traders. Internally too, it was more difficult to process palm oil, and to crack the palm nuts to obtain the kernels than to organize slave supply. For the delta merchants, it meant having to penetrate deeper into the hinterland to the centres of production, and the use of a larger labour force and canoes. It was a situation with the potential for making the old established leaders bankrupt, and encouraging the rise of new enterprising ones.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Production and trade', 'content': ""The abolition of the slave trade by Britain in 1807 introduced an element of structural imbalance into this situation, especially in the south, where surveillance was instituted earliest and maintained most strictly, although domestic slavery was tolerated.$^{48}$ During the second half of the nineteenth century slavery expanded very substantially, especially in the Niger bend. This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange. It is not surprising, then, to find entire groups, such as the Zamberma, spe› cializing in the extraction of this 'black ore'. The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered.

The Leboos this year have ""lost"" (?) 25 to 30 per cent. Jolloff traders, natives of Bathurst, seem, many of them, as bad; so that people now say, ""Where are we to get good reliable men?""\n\nYou may say, ""Put the criminal law in force."" Yes, if this were England, you could; but not in Gambia. The law is powerless. In the first place, you cannot bring the man up under the Imperial statute for embezzlement, as you cannot give proof of ""conversion."" No native will come into court and give evidence of such ""conversion."" Well, to meet this, some years ago, a local ordinance was passed, by which any factor, trader, or agent trading up the river, who, being entrusted with goods, on his return to Bathurst, was deficient in his accounts, and could not satisfactorily answer for the same, was liable to two years\' imprisonment. Well, when the conduct of traders became unbearable, three years ago, two test cases were brought before the Judge at the Sessions; and though the cases were clearly proved, and even one of the men confessed to have embezzled goods, the jury in each case refused to convict; and in one case, after much argument, the Foreman clinched the arguments by saying, ""We must not convict this man; if we do, none of us are safe."" This juror did not understand that the Act only applies to trade in the river, not in Bathurst, and he was a shopkeeper here, and a great church-goer. Thus, you see that the law is made inoperative, and we have no protection whatever against fraud. You can, of course, sue a man in the Civil Court; but, then, as he seldom has in Bathurst more than the clothes he stands in, as soon as the writ is issued he leaves Bathurst; or else, if he defends the case, as soon as judgment is marked; and if he does return again, you can do nothing, as there is nothing to ""seize."" Natives of Sierra Leone go away to the place; Mandingoes go up the river; Jolloffs do the same; Leboos go to Senegal.

They made such a plausible tale that I was quite taken with them, and forwarded a box of gold dust, together with samples of goods I wanted in return. This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me. But I hope my experience will be of some use to others who, trading on the West Coast of Africa, are under the necessity of trusting so much to persons or firms in London or the other European capitals.—Yours faithfully,', 'last_edit_date': '1891-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1891#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL DEPRESSION ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The most unpleasant side of the question to me is that, after these inexperienced European merchants have so imprudently supplied goods to adventurous traders without securities, or worthless securities (and many a time without any reference to the Coast respecting the pecuniary status or reputation of the consignee), they are only too ready to brand all Africans as a race of dishonest robbers. A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . . It has sometimes been to us a question whether these persons did ever really intend to repay the loans they so freely squander away when they sought for them.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Present Depression in all Branches of African Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Yet the Government is not alone to blame. Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed. A large portion of the trade was doubtless in slaves, but still that alone could never have accounted for the prosperity and wealth of the merchants who traded with Western Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

A Royal Commission has been appointed to inquire into the causes of depression in trade. The causes of the depression in African trade are not far to seek, and the remedies must be applied by the Government, and not by the merchants.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

The article in question says:—\n\nOne of the ways in which the development of trade must be carried out is by pushing factories up beyond the tribes who now serve as middlemen between the European trader and the native producer. Some difficulty will no doubt be encountered in passing through the unhealthy and malarious districts in which these middlemen live, but the improved knowledge we are obtaining of how to combat climatic diseases will render such an enterprise more easy than it would have been twenty years ago. Indeed, if we contrast the early reports of the Niger with its present exploitation, we may believe that the climate of no tropical country will permanently prevent its being opened up to commerce. This is a ray of hope for our African traders, and it is to be hoped that our Government will enable them to avail themselves of it speedily, and not allow them to be forestalled by the merchants of other nations. As if the inaction of our Government had not been sufficiently disastrous to the trade of the African merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, the home legislation of the last few years has also done much to hamper their enterprise. One industry alone, which, though it may be considered a small one, came in the aggregate to a considerable amount, has been completely driven out of the country. The trade in matches to the West Coast used to be supplied by Manchester. Now, the children who used to be employed in their manufacture are sent to school hungry, while German matches are sent in German ships to those who used to buy the English ones, and the only profit to English people is that of the middleman, and even that is being rapidly taken from them.\n\nThe German and French textile manufactures are also running us close, and we have to watch carefully the change of fashions and ideas among the natives. Many cheap articles made in France, with a ready sale on the coast, could easily be made in England. Some of the native manufactures could easily be imitated, such as the Niger cloths and the silk and cotton cloths made by the Santees and Ashantees of unravelled European stuffs. Beyond the Oil rivers to the south we have the French colony of the Gaboon, which has now become one of the largest tracts of Africa controlled by an European nation.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Yet in 1879 this whole structure began to crumble, and by 1900 it had ceased to exist.' With the imposition of colonial rule, 'the characteristic link between Africans and Europeans was no longer that between trading partners ... The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance. Hopkins warns us not to imagine that Niger delta traders like Nana Olomu were forerunners of nationalism or spokesmen for popular griev› ances, pointing out that their 'vision of social justice did not include the emancipation of their own slaves'. Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""This effort at self-development was perhaps most prominent in the realm of political structures and state power. The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy.

At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification.

At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African challenge to European authority', 'content': ""of Nyasas and their large death toll in the first weeks of the war in battle with the Germans.

As J. L. Vellut has emphasized, the nineteenth century was not just 'the history of the ebb and flow of the world economy as experienced by ... Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'. He fed, clothed and met social obligations of members; he determined the size of land and the type of crops to be cultivated each year; how much time to spend on the collective household farm (gandu; plur., gandaye), and how much on"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In Sierra Leone, the frustration of the educated classes and the African traders, and the unemployed in the big towns was given open expression in the riots of 1919 in which protests against the price of rice took the form of attacks on Syrian and Lebanese traders, and in the workers' strike that same year. Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy. The looting and the riots spread from Free› town to Moyamba, Kangahun (25-26 July 1919), Mano, Boia, Makump, Bo, Bonthe, Mange and Port Lokko. The situation was so serious that troops had to be brought in from the Gold Coast. In addition to the riots, the technical staff and labourers on the railway and in the public works department went on strike, demanding the same war bonus paid to the government clerical staff, and complaining of low wages and rising food prices.$^{2}$ In The Gambia, too, rising prices had their social and political effects, leading to sporadic outbursts of looting and petty theft, as well as a seamen's strike for better wages, and to the formation of unions, notably the Gambia Native Defensive Union.\nThe 1921 slump also led to more agitation from West African merchants, a few of whom were financially ruined. The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The area with which we are concerned is broadly bounded by the Atlantic coast on the west, Lake Tanganyika and the Nile-Zaire ridge on the east, the Ubangui savannas on the north, and the plateau separating the Zaire and Zambezi basins to the south. The period we shall deal with cannot be limited to a single theme. Contrary to the common belief, the history of the years 1800-80 is not a matter only or mainly of long-distance trade and links with the outside world (the economy of Central African communities at this period was still based more on production than on trade). Nor can the precolonial nineteenth century be regarded as an era of widespread violence, because of the slave trade, civil strife, etc.: the commonplace belief that Africa was racked by incessant 'tribal warfare' overlooks the basic fact that the bulk of the peoples in the area led peaceful lives as producers, steadily improving their farming methods, bettering their environment and exporting the produce of food-gathering. Finally, the history of the nineteenth century is not to be reduced to purely political history concerned with despotic kingdoms and states: if there is a political feature common to the Central African communities of the period around 1800, it is more likely to be the much disputed quest for equilibrium and accommodation between powers derived from different sources.\nAn historical account of nineteenth-century Central Africa must in fact satisfy several requirements. It must describe the ordinary life and aspirations of the societies in this enormous area at the time. This would bring out the continuity between the 1800s and the more distant past: the changes, although noticeable, were slow.\nAt the same time, the history of Central Africa in the nineteenth century is characterized by breaks with the past. After all, in the years 1800-80 the area was more a part of the world trading network than ever before. The impact of the world economic situation, or of some specific sectors of it, was making itself felt: in some areas it influenced social and political history, giving a noticeable impetus to trade and offering new opportunities for stockpiling, while in others it restricted the process.

They included the Railway Workers Union of Sierra Leone, the Nigerian Mechanics Union formed in 1919 and the Gambia Native Defence Union. The typical weapons of these unions were strikes, boycotts and hold-ups. The first series of strikes occurred among the railway and mine workers.

The Ibadans, as we are informed, are now in arms ready for this place, or may go to the Ijebu territory if the Dahomans fail to come forward. Of course we are not behind in our preparations. Our numerous farmers around are all in, ready to man our walls. Two of our villages, Ishals and Abo, not being aware that the Dahomans would pass by their roads, were suddenly carried off to hopeless slavery; guns and powder not being supplied to them from Abeokuta this year, which still renders these poor creatures a hopeless defence. Rumours say they will be in all about 500 souls—men, women, and children! To say nothing of the dead! Thus you see the evil ordinance, prohibiting and supplying guns, &c., in certain cases.\n\nYou would not be surprised to hear of our roads of produce, going down to Lagos, being blockaded on the 18th ult. Apart from the grievance before mentioned, guns and powder have been distributed to our territories below Otta by the Lagos Government; this additional evil has been the cause of the roads being finally closed up, until better understanding for peace can be arrived at between the two Governments.\n\nAll your letters for January to the Secretary of State were read to the Egbas; his lordship\'s reply to your letters not being favourable, and because of the implicit confidence and good faith which we have already planted in the minds of the Egbas towards Her Majesty the Queen and good people in England, the Board of Management has refrained reading that reply to His Supreme Majesty Oyekon, as it will cause grief and loss of confidence in the minds of the Egbas, who are strongly allied with the sister country, Ijebus, for peace or war against their common enemies. The people of Abeokuta have no more faith in Glover\'s Administration, and so long as England would not believe your letters, although truthfully and justly written for the good of Africa, I am afraid ""the roads here, as well as in other places around, will remain perfectly closed, until the death of Glover or his final removal from Lagos.""

So there is not much chance of the roads being re-opened for some years to come. If the roads are to be re-opened at all, it must be by shot, shell, and rockets, or by blockading them. The natives, instead of sending produce, destroy it; whilst vessels here have to leave in ballast. It is a great pity that Governor Glover ever left, as I am sure that, had he been here, he would have opened the roads before this. There is a strong feeling in Lagos in favour of Governor Glover, and even his opponents are beginning to see that they have been de- luded. There is no resource left but force; and the Home Government will be culpable if they neglect to make use of it. Ever since Governor Glover was recalled, both the Lagos Government and its messengers have been treated with contempt, especially by the King of the Je- bus. The British flag has been dishonoured and treated con- temptuously by a few tribes of semi-barbarians, who still hold the power of England at defiance. At first there were only two tribes, the Abeokutans and the Jebus, opposed to the opening of the road, but now the Yorubas have joined; so that, with the exception of Porto Novo, Lagos is completely blockaded for business purposes.\' Our correspondent adds that his own con- viction is that a general appeal will be made, both by the Europeans and natives, for the return of ex-Governor Glover, and that the result of Governor Glover\'s re-appointment will be the opening of the roads into the interior, and the consequent full resumption of trade.""'}, {'id': 2756, 'article_title': 'SLAVERY ON THE GOLD COAST', 'full_section_title': 'SLAVERY ON THE GOLD COAST', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1874#article-12', 'issue_date': '29_08_1874', 'content': '### A LITTLE WAR IN PORTO NOVO.\n\nWe are sorry to learn, by latest intelligence from Lagos, not only that there is a domestic war at Porto Novo between two sets of Princes there, but that the Egbas have been so ill advised as to side with one of the parties against the other, and send an armed expedition to Porto Novo in aid of one of the contending parties. This, our Lagos correspondent adds, has necessarily interfered a little with the trade of Lagos westward; while the reopening of the Jebu portion of the Eastward trade has not yet been productive of much benefit, in consequence of the palm fruit having been allowed to rot on the trees during the long-continued suspension of trade with Lagos. This little incident shows anew how difficult it is to coerce these native kings to trade with us, through any desire on the part of their people to obtain those European goods which they willingly work for and willingly purchase while trade with Lagos is pursuing its ordinary course; and how indispensable it is to the trading prosperity of Lagos that there should be a man of prudence, conciliatory as well as firm, at the head of Lagos affairs.

Furthermore, Lagos had a reserved fund of £20,000, in the hands of Crown Agents, before the amalgamation scheme was set on foot. A sum of £10,000 should have been reserved at the end of 1883, and a further sum of £10,000 before the close of 1884, making £40,000, which is expected to be in the hands of Crown Agents in favour of Lagos. If this is absorbed into the revenue of the Gold Coast according to the present arrangement, we hesitate not to say that Lagos would derive no benefit from the revenue it raises, and to the full advantage of which it is entitled.\n\n8. We may mention as one proof of the impracticability of the amalgamation scheme, the fact that the laws governing the tariff of both places are not identical, it being found, no doubt, by our rulers extremely difficult to make them so; for whilst the duty on spirits in Lagos is 6d. per gallon, that on the Gold Coast is 2s. 6d. per gallon; and whilst the cost of license to retail spirits in Lagos is £25 annually, that on the Gold Coast is £2; and whilst an auctioneer's license in Lagos costs from £25 to £26 10s., on the Gold Coast it is only £10.\n\n9. We are not unmindful, however, of the unsteady and unreliable condition of the trade and revenue of Lagos through frequent misunderstanding with and among the surrounding tribes, some of them sometimes very serious; but such unsteadiness and unreliableness are common with other places on the Coast. We, however, believe that the warfare in the interior, which has been a serious injury and drawback to Lagos, and lost the interior countries on which Lagos absolutely depends for its commerce, since itself produces nothing, very many of their inhabitants might have been composed long ago if our Government had been more or less independent and the policy of non-intervention less rigid.\n\n10. We beg leave, in connexion with the question of separation, to point out, to and urge upon your Lordship the desirability of a Council Board at Lagos, on which the people would be properly represented, for dealing with matters affect-\n**TABULAR STATEMENT.—A.**\n\n**STATEMENT** showing offices requiring alterations in their original annual estimated expenditure as per Lagos Estimates for 1883.

The Governor, not feeling satisfied with their reply, and believing that the war was being carried on by a retrograde minority of the people, threatened to bring the Egbas to reason by closing the road to Abbeokuta and preventing all trade between that place and Lagos. Further robberies on traders, and the prospect of an attack by the Dahomians on Abbeokuta, led the Governor to issue a proclamation recommending the Europeans residing there to leave the place, and eventually to carry out his threat of proclaiming a blockade of Abbeokuta; these proceedings were very displeasing to some of the inhabitants of Lagos, and were made the subject of complaint by the Church Missionary Society in England, who addressed a memorial on the subject to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which they urged that immediate measures should be taken for checking the policy of the Governor.\n\nNow, without denying that exception might perhaps be taken to the language and style of the Governor's proclamations and communications to the native chiefs, and admitting that his policy may have been injurious to the Abbeokutan cause, it does not, therefore, follow that it was either improper or injudicious. In an interview with the acting Governor in 1863, the head chief of the Abbeokutans not only admitted that robbery and destruction of property were the natural results of war, but stated that it was their custom, under such circumstances, to destroy trade and property in order to recruit the army, and to drive the people to war, and that if they allowed trading there would be no soldiers. The statement goes far to support the opinion expressed by the Governor that the war was carried on for the satisfaction of a minority, and to justify him in believing that the best way to bring the chiefs to reason would be to stop their supplies from Lagos."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

During the past fifteen years its northern frontier had been constantly harassed by the inroads of the Mohammedans, who had made Ilorin their centre of operations towards the south, and by that renewed pressure from the north the inhabitants of Yoruba had not only been cut off from their former sources of supplies in that direction, but had also been forced to submit to the exactions and commercial blockade of their weaker kinsmen who inhabit the neighbourhood of the Gulf lagoons. These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands.

The continual wars led to slave catching, and the result was that the trade routes to the interior were, with few exceptions, closed to traffic, and it was more difficult for a trader to penetrate beyond the coast line than for a Mohammedan to traverse the desert of Sahara.

The average prices in Europe of the more important native products have stood even lower than during the previous twelve months, while the prolonged continuance of low prices in Africa has apparently disheartened the native producer, and tended to diminish the quantity as well as the value of his out-turn. In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed. A large portion of the trade was doubtless in slaves, but still that alone could never have accounted for the prosperity and wealth of the merchants who traded with Western Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL INTERESTS IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""commerce if carried by steamers. The demand for kola nuts was reported to be at all times considerable in Brazil, but in view of the slowness of the passage and the difficulty of keeping them in marketable condition, the value has at no time during the past six years exceeded £3,563, while in 1877 it sank as low as £304. Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Royal Mail steamer Axim, which arrived in the Mersey on Sept. 11, having left Accra on August 28, reported trade as in a very bad state, practically little or no produce coming down from the interior.

The society was formed among the Imperi in the Isle of Sherbro, part of the colony of Sierra Leone. It originated in a desire for vengeance for the death of a troop of warriors, who while on an expedition were slaughtered by the Imperi. A sorcerer who was consulted devised a fetish called boffima, the owner of which would have all his wishes gratified. It is a tuber, the size of an ostrich\'s egg, which is hollowed out, filled with some secret mixture, and enveloped in leopard\'s hide. To retain its virtue it had to be occasionally greased with human fat. Every candidate for admission to the society undertook to inveigle some relative, slave, or neighbour, to a gathering, at which this stranger was murdered by a member wearing a leopard\'s hide, and the body was eaten. A few years ago the chiefs of the district formed a rival society for exterminating those cannibals, but innocent persons having been murdered through false denunciations, the English authorities put it down. As, however, the outrages then revived, a spy was induced to give information which led to the arrest of six ""human leopards."" One died in prison and the other five have been tried and hanged.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'African participation in the colonial economy, 1920-30', 'content': ""African peasants were up against the commercial system. The tendency of West African merchant firms to monopolize through 'pools' is well known, and trading companies throughout the continent guarded their interests by refusing to compete in such a way as to raise prices. Indeed, intermediaries such as the 'Asians' in East Africa and the Lebanese in West Africa also set prices and conditions among themselves so that the African peasant had little choice when he went to make his sales. The cash-crop farmer faced the prospect of being gypped at the weighing scales, in the processing stage (as with the cotton ginnery), in transportation, in the calculation of returns and in the repayment of loans or advances where applicable. African producers were also making retail purchases from the middlemen traders and the commercial firms. A fundamental inequality marked the exchange between the colonial economy and the metropolises. This unequal exchange was reflected in the disparity between the low remuneration Africans received and the relatively high cost of manu› factured imports; and it also manifested itself in the low wage rate in the colonies as compared with the metropolises. Of course, unequal exchange was not a purely economic phenomenon. It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration.

At first many African slave-owners, chiefs and traders might respond to the Europeans with fear and hatred, but many of them found that in the longer run the interest of black and white holders of power often coincided. In this way a profound transformation of the pattern of resistance took place."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'As an eminent economist has pointed out, \'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically. Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa. African technological development was thereby halted and was never resumed until after independence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': ""On the eve of the 'Scramble'"", 'content': ""lend itself to a unified struggle against the Europeans.

In the first instance they were particularly vulnerable to external pressures, as suggested by the willingness of the Afro-Portuguese and Chikunda to serve as Lisbon's imperial agents. Ultimately, changing conditions within the world capitalist economy provoked opposition to their participation in the slave trade and, together with growing European imperial ambitions, set the stage for an intensive conflict."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C. Coquery-Vidrovitch has pointed out above (Chapter"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time. On the whole, coastal areas had had a longer contact with Europeans and Arabs than the interior areas. Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya. This was especially the case against the Nandi.$^{9}$ The Maasai example serves to illustrate the kind of dislocation that had taken place among the economies of various societies in this general area.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'These were the major forces determining population change but there were undoubtedly others. Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages. In 1894 half the total government revenue and 95 per cent of the customs duties of the Niger Coast Protectorate were derived from spirits; by 1894 the governmental income from this source totalled nearly £2 million.$^{46}$ Although the Brussels Act of 1892 tried unsuccessfully to limit the trade in the Congo (now Zaire), it was not successfully regulated in tropical Africa until the eve of the First World War.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The neglect of technical and industrial education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and the consequent love for white-collar jobs also created among the educated folk disdain for manual labour and agricul› tural work which is still with us.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 54, 'article_title': 'LAGOS', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-8', 'issue_date': '23_12_1862', 'content': 'We are sorry to be obliged to state that the trade communications between this place and Abeokuta have been interrupted during an entire month—viz., from October 7 to November 6.

There is not a shadow of reasoning in the entire document that would convince the most shallow mind of its necessity. Bathurst merchants in general are not remarkable for liberal and philanthropic ideas, but one would suppose that when they formed an iniquitous compact to compromise the social interests of the native traders they had a fair show of convincing argument based upon sound principles to offer in proof of their point, instead of a conglomeration of ill-digested statements, such as are contained in the memorial before us.\n\nThe memorial opens with a prayer for protection from fraudulent debtors, and the very humane wish that Earl Kimberley would sanction the opening of the gaol gates once more, in order that ""debtors of an unfortunate class"" might find a home.

The next part of his letter is a groan over the sinner, as Sam Weller\'s ""Shepherd"" would say; but this only proves that he adds hypocrisy to the best of his perfections, for if he felt any kindly feelings at all for Owens why judge him before his trial? He goes on to say ""the particular acts of theft charged against him were undoubtedly proved."" I want to know how this can be when the judge clearly said in his charge to us jurymen, that one of the two charges—namely, the second—could not legally be maintained, and that we must try him only on the first charge, which was for the theft or embezzlement of 8 tons 8 cwt. of nuts. Mr. Owens was not ably defended. Mr. Morris his lawyer has, I believe, only lately been admitted as an attorney on the Coast, and is therefore no match for Mr. Walcott, barrister-at-law of Grays Inn; and a clever lawyer who was present at the whole trial, told me that he would have had no difficulty in clearing Mr. Owens if he had been retained, and probably this will be shown when the case comes on again for trial before an English judge and clever lawyers. ""Lynx"" does not understand why I took it upon myself to ask questions in reply. It was my duty to ask the judge to put questions which my fellow jurors wanted to have put, and most of the questions I did ask I was directed to do by them. The questions I asked on my own account were asked to make clear in my brains the chief points from which I drew my conclusions and which Mr. Walcott tried in a masterly way to muddle and slur over, Mr. Morris\'s great deficiency, as cross-examining counsel, making this doubly necessary. This was my right, and if I had not done it I should have gone out of the box with no clear conception of the case. As regards the fiction he indulges in about my fellow jurymen remonstrating with me, I reply it is a gratuitous invention; and as for the extraordinary speech he alleges I made, I give you my word of honour not one syllable of it came out of my lips. The judge summed up dead against Mr. Owens, but only on the first charge; and in summing up the facts that led to his conclusion on that charge he quite forgot a material fact which, I have heard asserted, would have made the whole case no longer legally tenable. My procedure as foreman of the jury next gives ""Lynx"" trouble, but it was quite different to his idea of it. After we were seated I called on the jurors, as is the rule, by name, beginning with the youngest, to give his verdict, which I recorded as given; and then, when I saw we disagreed, I proceeded calmly to open the debate by stating my reasons for believing Mr. Owens to be innocent.

The second charge was dealt with by the judge who told us it was legally untenable, because agreed value at M\'Carthy rates was given for the nuts, and delivery of the nuts was made to Mamadoo in the river; besides, the nuts were never Verminck\'s property. Mamadoo proving the nuts to be bought from property put in the hands of Verminck\'s trader to sell, in order to give him the appearance of doing business while he collected Verminck\'s debts, and that the nuts received did not fully pay this property by $120, and S. F. Owens did not directly or indirectly benefit by Mamadoo\'s business. In this view I fully coincide. But on the first charge we disagreed, the judge being of opinion that Mr. Owens was guilty. The issue was—Did Owens really borrow the 8 tons 8 cwt. of nuts for account of his brother, or was it a plea put in after to cover his crime, and had he the right to lend people Verminck\'s nuts? It came out in evidence, if he were agent he would have the right by custom to borrow and lend nuts to respectable persons to keep up cordial relations when it was convenient and safe. It came out also that the agent at Bathurst made Mr. Owens believe he was agent in order to do his work well, and wrote him to that effect. So for my part, judging for the truth only, with no man\'s fear or favour in view, I felt convinced Owens really thought and was led to believe that he was agent, and believed he had power to lend nuts and borrow nuts if needs be, provided he ran no risks; and from the evidence I gathered that he did bona fide lend the nuts to accommodate his half-brother\'s business, which at that particular time he was managing in the absence of his half-brother; that the intention was evidently to accommodate the half-brother\'s business, but as he made no gain or benefit to himself in helping his half-brother, no loss to Verminck, and returned them within fourteen days in a better quality of nuts and before anyone knew or asked him about them. I must say I do not believe he ever had the intention of stealing them, which is the whole sum of the charge. The only point against Mr. Owens was, why he did not charge the loan in the books. The answer to this is, he charged his stock with the nuts, and thus charged himself with them in the books, for he was responsible for the stock. Why he did not pass the transaction through the books he explains by saying, ""I did do so in my private memo. book and diary, but did not extend it into the house-books, because I only intended the loan to be for a short time, and did not want a lot of queries about it from my chief at Bathurst, who was quarrelsome."" Now, I believe this explanation, and it would require some good grounds for me to think that a man who has lived half his life in this colony in good credit and repute, who has married and got children, and is the centre of a large circle of relatives and friends, and who is worth property, would suddenly change his nature and steal for another 8 tons 8 cwt. of nuts, a value of about 33l. In my mind the whole charge comes to a cashier lending cash to a customer to whom he is permitted to lend it, and only making a private entry, because it will be only for a few hours. Such an act in my mind is not criminal. Others may think differently from me, as, for instance, ""Lynx;"" but if all that think differently from me are of the ""Lynx"" turn of mind, I will be contented to think differently from them all my life.—I am, Sir, your obedient servant, THOMAS F.

The charter was obtained on the statement that all other European interests in that district had been bought up, which is not the case, and the members of the section are therefore of opinion that the charter should be revoked."" It was further resolved that the Council of the Chamber should be asked to adopt the resolution and forward copies of it to certain members of the Government, members of Parliament, and Chambers of Commerce.\n\nA letter from the Colonial Office relating to the administration of the Gold Coast was read. In it Sir H. Holland stated that the Government had consented that the Sefwhi country should on certain conditions be included in the British Protectorate, and he trusted that this action, together with the appointment of Captain Lonsdale as a Commissioner to visit the native tribes, will conduce to a reopening of the roads and an improvement and development of trade.\n\nThe *Liverpool Courier* has published the correspondence between Mr. W.

What are the facts? A company not long in existence has been granted sovereign rights and taxing powers over the imports and exports of from five to eight millions of people, and no company trading for its own benefit can exercise such powers in an impartial manner. Powers such as these can only be properly used by an independently-organized body, altogether unconnected with trade. Probably the Government having negotiated treaties with countries up the Niger, were glad to transfer their responsibility to the first who asked for it. Nominally there was to be no monopoly, but practically the greater number of traders are entirely debarred from doing business, and instead of there being free trade, open to all comers, the trade is absolutely shut up.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position. The trade of the district was gradually passing into the hands of the French, from the want of activity and determination on the part of the British authorities.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed. A large portion of the trade was doubtless in slaves, but still that alone could never have accounted for the prosperity and wealth of the merchants who traded with Western Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some Minor Trading Stations on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We may now take up the consideration of another portion of Africa, one which till lately was considered as being peculiarly under British influence, and as places where British trade need fear no competition—the Oil Rivers. Unfortunately, the traders and merchants considered that the independence of the chiefs was more for their benefit than the establishment of British rule; that the influence of the British Consul, backed up by an occasional gunboat, was sufficient to prevent any serious difficulties; and that the treaties with the chiefs secured trade on profitable and equitable terms.\n\nUnder the old régime large fortunes were made, but competition has now much reduced the profits, while German and French annexations have closed some districts to Englishmen and seriously injured their interests in others. In the days that were gone, the courts of equity, formed of the principal merchants, used, with the assistance of the British Consul or the captain of a man-of-war, to smooth all local disputes, settle prices, and generally make regulations for the conduct of trade. Whilst all the merchants were English this system acted very well, although no doubt at times considerable difficulties arose.\n\nForeign competition has sprung up now to a very considerable extent, most of it being in the hands of Germans, and the way that the trade has passed into their hands is not creditable to the foresight or patriotism of English merchants. Even when trade was conducted at more remunerative rates than at present, the scale of pay to clerks and subordinates was not sufficiently high to induce men of education and standing to face the risks of the African climate, and separate themselves from their families and the comforts of civilization for lengthened periods; and in consequence, among those who went to the coast, there were some men whose ideas of commercial morality were at a very low ebb.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: The Arrest of King Ja Ja', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'SIR,—I note in some of the daily newspapers an announcement of the arrest of King Ja Ja, of Opobo, West Africa, by the British Consul, on account of his disregard of certain trade obligations. As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN ""MIDDLEMAN"" AND OTHER HINDRANCES TO TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the course of some excellent articles which have appeared lately in the *Manchester Guardian*, dealing with the present and future trade prospects of Africa, we have one chapter devoted to the consideration of the drawbacks upon genuine commerce by the enforcement of such quasi-regal rights as those exercised by Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, and the rest of that host of petty kinglings, in the districts of the West Coast. The article in question says:—\n\nOne of the ways in which the development of trade must be carried out is by pushing factories up beyond the tribes who now serve as middlemen between the European trader and the native producer. Some difficulty will no doubt be encountered in passing through the unhealthy and malarious districts in which these middlemen live, but the improved knowledge we are obtaining of how to combat climatic diseases will render such an enterprise more easy than it would have been twenty years ago. Indeed, if we contrast the early reports of the Niger with its present exploitation, we may believe that the climate of no tropical country will permanently prevent its being opened up to commerce. This is a ray of hope for our African traders, and it is to be hoped that our Government will enable them to avail themselves of it speedily, and not allow them to be forestalled by the merchants of other nations. As if the inaction of our Government had not been sufficiently disastrous to the trade of the African merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, the home legislation of the last few years has also done much to hamper their enterprise. One industry alone, which, though it may be considered a small one, came in the aggregate to a considerable amount, has been completely driven out of the country. The trade in matches to the West Coast used to be supplied by Manchester. Now, the children who used to be employed in their manufacture are sent to school hungry, while German matches are sent in German ships to those who used to buy the English ones, and the only profit to English people is that of the middleman, and even that is being rapidly taken from them.\n\nThe German and French textile manufactures are also running us close, and we have to watch carefully the change of fashions and ideas among the natives. Many cheap articles made in France, with a ready sale on the coast, could easily be made in England. Some of the native manufactures could easily be imitated, such as the Niger cloths and the silk and cotton cloths made by the Santees and Ashantees of unravelled European stuffs. Beyond the Oil rivers to the south we have the French colony of the Gaboon, which has now become one of the largest tracts of Africa controlled by an European nation.

With the exception of the Senegal, the river is the finest on this part of the coast, but it is almost useless for trade purposes, because the country is in so disturbed a condition. Wax, hides, and ground nuts are the principal exports. The ground nuts are sent to Marseilles, where a substitute for olive oil is pressed from them. Rice, cotton, maize, and a kind of millet are also produced, but not in sufficient quantities for export. The charge on ordinary merchandise is 2 per cent. _ad valorem_.\n\nSierra Leone, with a coast line 200 miles long, has a trade of a different character, the produce of the palm, nuts and oil, hides, gum copal, ground nuts, ginger, and kola nuts being exported. The gum copal and the palm oil are for the most part shipped to Great Britain, and the hides to the United States.\n\nThe most promising place of all in this part of the world is Lagos, where the natives are eager to trade. The exports are palm oil and various oil seeds; but although the chances of business are excellent, British rule has failed to develop trade to anything like the extent that was anticipated. The reason is the isolation of the settlements, which were originally slave settlements. Fifty years ago slavery was abolished, and then, instead of making a radical change in the methods of government which the altered conditions required, no action was taken, and the machinery of government was merely adapted to the circumstances. The British Administration has made practically no effort to conciliate the tribes in the interior, or to remove the suspicions which the early history of the colonies had implanted in the minds of the natives. Custom-houses were set up, and, as the natives derive no benefit from the expenditure of the taxes in the colonies, they naturally did not like the new institutions. Then, again, the natives on the coast hate those in the interior, and British administrators invariably sided with the former. The three Ashantee wars were due to this cause. If efforts were made to conciliate the Mandingoes, the Foulahs, and other large tribes in the interior, the trade of these settlements would certainly not consist, as it does at the present time, almost exclusively of the produce of the fringe of land adjoining the sea. The Americans and Germans, particularly the latter, are looking after this trade.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

The establishment of our trading connexion direct with Great Britain is due entirely to the maintenance of the monthly mail communication by the steamers running between Liverpool and the settlement, and but for which it might have been impossible.\n\nWe, therefore, regard with serious apprehension the ruin which threatens an enterprise which many of us have embarked in in the earliest days of our lives, and which will cut off from us the fruits which it has been our desire to enjoy in old days. Not only will such a measure cut off our source of supplies, but oblige us to be at the mercy of the French merchants, who already command the trade; and we shall be deprived of the facilities which hitherto have enabled us to maintain competition with our French neighbours in the trade, and will cause tastes and preferences by the natives in the interior of the district, and the wish of the natives for British manufactures will be checked.\n\nThe discontinuance of the mail service will also affect the export trade in ground nuts, which has been only recently created, and the results of which have led us to hope that a fair field of competition would be opened against the French market, where the great bulk of this produce has hitherto been consigned. By the service of the mail steamers, cheap food and provisions are within the reach of all classes in the community, and, in the event of this service being discontinued, a state of things altogether unpleasant will be brought about by those in whose hands the advantage lies.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Present Depression in all Branches of African Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This subject is (says the *Manchester Guardian*, in a series of excellent articles upon the present state of the West Coast of Africa, now under publication) a very wide one, the trade of Africa being carried on under such different conditions, by such different races, and the goods dealt in being so various, that it would seem difficult to bring all under one discussion; but, unfortunately, all the trade of Africa has one great point of similarity, and that is that all is depressed, and much is passing into the hands of foreign competitors.

These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands.

The continual wars led to slave catching, and the result was that the trade routes to the interior were, with few exceptions, closed to traffic, and it was more difficult for a trader to penetrate beyond the coast line than for a Mohammedan to traverse the desert of Sahara.

The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers.

In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

In 1932 Imperial Preference was introduced in British dependencies. Imports from the British Empire had customs duties fixed at between 10 and 50% lower than the general level. But since trade between the dependencies was negligible, the intended beneficiary of the arrangement was obviously Britain. In September 1931 the Colonial Office dispatched a circular to officers administering depen› dencies asking them to help Britain and reminding them that: the interests of the United Kingdom and those of the Colonies and Dependencies are inseparably bound up with one another, that the perils which face the United Kingdom are perils which menace the whole Empire ... that any general collapse of British credit and declir - in the exchange value of sterling must spell ruin for the colonies no less than for the United Kingdom. 83 Despite the higher tariff on non-British goods, their importation, to the advantage of consumers in the dependencies, increased greatly.

In 1934 a further attack was made on non-British goods by raising the tariff to 100%, as a general rule. In addition, a quota system was imposed on the importation of Japanese textiles. There were isolated protests against these measures but the colon› ized people had to pay high prices, thereby promoting imperialist interests at their own expense."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Beyond the official rhetoric, the mundane purposes of colonization turned out to be quite limited. In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'By the second decade of the present century the British had firmly estab› lished themselves in many parts of tropical Africa including Nigeria, Gold Coast (now Ghana), The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Nyasaland (now Malawi), Uganda, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa (see Fig. 2.1) and the colonial economies were clearly taking shape. This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities', 'content': 'But diplomacy and warfare aside, the commonest instrument of policy in inter-state relations was economic. Military destruction of crops or grain stores was only one aspect. Particular groups, such as the Tuareg, might be refused access to markets, to certain commodities (like grain) or to wells. Given the local annual variations in rainfall, such bans could be very effective. Less effective were embargoes on the export or import of items such as horses, weapons, salt or types of cloth, while an indiscriminate blockade of towns or areas was difficult to sustain, not least because smuggling offered high profits. But the disruption in the normal flow of caliphal trade caused for example by Ningi and Mbutawa raids was serious enough to require a remedy. Indeed their own experience of severe food shortages and the interruption of the grain trade during the djifiàd had made men like Muhammad Bello acutely aware of the importance of encouraging traders by keeping roads open, establishing markets and enforcing the laws regulating fair trading. In consequence, as the caliphal economy became relatively more efficient and neighbouring peoples depended more heavily on caliphal trade and traders, economic policy was increasingly a more effective instrument of power than warfare.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': 'The basic and almost only means of production in the British dependencies in the period up to 1935 was land. British attitudes and policies towards land varied from region to region, and even, in each region, from colony to colony. It can be stated in general terms, however, that whereas Africans remained in practice in control of their lands in British West Africa, many of them were deprived of theirs in British East and Central Africa. There were, however, some important variations from colony to colony in each region.\nIn Uganda and to a lesser extent Tanganyika, most of the fertile land was owned by the indigenous population, the Africans. With a few ex› ceptions, for example Buganda in Uganda, the Bukoba and Kilimanjaro areas in Tanganyika and Gikuyuland in Kenya, land did not acquire market value on a large scale, and it was held communally. Every member of the community had the right to land. In most cases it was labour, and not land, which was the scarcer means of production.\nForeigners, mostly British, secured and held concessions on land with mineral and timber resources, but such arrangements had little adverse effect on the local agricultural communities. In some cases, however, serious hardships were faced where mineral resources were located on rich arable land.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Tax evasion continued with great frequency in the years immediately following the First World War. Thousands of Congolese peasants fled across the open borders to the adjacent regions of Angola and the French Congo, while others disappeared into the bush just prior to the arrival of state tax officials. The Angolan border was particularly attractive because the Portuguese colonial presence was so minimal and because of historic ties that united the Bakongo living on both sides of the frontier. Many members of the rural population used a similar strategy to avoid working on state projects, mines and European plantations. As one elder who was ordered to work on the Katanga railway line recalled, 'We just escaped from our village ... Nobody knew where we had gone, not even the white people at the boma. We left our village at night time and headed for the Luapula. At the river some good fishermen helped us to cross.'$^{38}$ Still other peasants refused to cultivate the obligatory cotton or rice or planted less than the required amounts. 39 As the state apparatus extended into the more remote areas and a network of loyalist chiefs was created, however, possibilities of remaining outside the colonial-capitalist system diminished substantially/Increased state hegemony is reflected by the 400% increase in taxes extracted between 1917 and 1924 and by the dramatic rise in the number of peasants compelled to cultivate cotton.$^{40}$ As of 1935 it was estimated that more than 900000 peasants were enmeshed in the cotton regime."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': 'The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock. First, it did not involve any fundamental technological innovation.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': 'The economic balance sheet', 'content': 'Because they were held under strict control by the administrative authori› ties, and because of their very limited participation in social and economic changes, the populations, at the end of the period, were in a perilous situation, while the system itself was in the throes of change.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 71, 'article_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'full_section_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'last_edit_date': '12-10-1862', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-1', 'issue_date': '23_01_1863', 'content': ""Sir,—The native war, which has for several months past been carried on with more or less intensity on the northern bank of the river, from its mouth to a distance of about seventy or eighty miles eastward, is, you will be sorry to find, still going on.

Both sides appear, however, to be now getting tired of the struggle, and the Colonial Government has been applied to by the belligerents to mediate between them. It is, of course, the Governor's wish that this war, which is doing so much damage to the trade of the river, should be immediately brought to an end; and with this view it is believed that it is his Excellency's intention at once to despatch an envoy with sufficient powers for the purpose.\n\nThe garrison of Fort Bullen, a little fort within half a mile of the scene of native strife, has been considerably strengthened by the addition of an officer and some gunners of the Gambia Militia Artillery, and no fear is now entertained for the safety of British property in its neighbourhood.\n\nThe General Sessions of the Peace for these settlements were held on the 18th inst.

Mr. Carter will proceed to England immediately after the return of Sir Samuel Rowe to his post as Governor-in-Chief of the West African Settlements.\n\nThe Hon. Gilbert Carter had an interview with Saide Mattie lately, this being the first instance on record of an important chief coming into British territory to meet the Governor. Saide Mattie had been requested to come for a strictly private interview, and to bring as few followers as possible with him. He promised that only twenty or thirty of his immediate attendants should accompany him, and the Administrator, therefore, went to Albreda with only two orderlies and an interpreter. After keeping Mr. Carter waiting for five days Saide Mattie arrived with a force of about 2,000 foot and 200 cavalry. He got off his horse to receive Mr. Carter, who immediately stated the object of his journey to meet the Chief. This was to mediate in a friendly spirit between Saide Mattie and his enemies, and to bring peace to his country. He therefore begged the Chief to let him know the precise terms he would accept from his principal rival, Beram Ceasey, who has hitherto successfully resisted him. Saide Mattie replied that he should insist on being recognised as Chief of the whole of Badiboo; that Beram Ceasey should surrender the whole of his towns to him; that certain towns in the ceded territory should be given up to him; and that the Bathurst Government should allow him a stipend. On these conditions he would protect traders and be a friend to Queen Victoria. Mr. Carter replied that it was impossible to agree to such terms, and pointed out that Beram Ceasey had acquired his territory in precisely the same manner as Mabah (his own father) had got Badiboo—namely, by conquest from the Mandingoes, and as after long fighting Saide Mattie had been unable to get\n\nback, he could not suppose that Beram Ceasey would surrender the territory. Mr. Carter would only consent, therefore, to mediate on the condition that Beram Ceasey was allowed to retain the territory he then occupied. The Chief did not relish Mr. Carter's plain speaking, but listened to his representations, and finally expressed his conviction that the British could make a settlement which would be satisfactory to all parties.

The total revenue of British Central Africa for the half year ending September 30, 1894, shows an increase over the corresponding period of 1893 of more than 33 per cent. The total imports of 1892 amounted to £38,480; in 1893 they increased to £49,142. In 1894 the Tshiroro imports on the Shiré River alone were £75,720. A pressing demand is made on behalf of the coffee planters for a railway from Tshiroro to Blantyre, as it is almost impossible to send large quantities of perishable goods down the river to the former place in the months of September and October, the river being then at its lowest, when no barges of any size or steamers can safely ply. During the current year there will probably be some 200 tons to transport down to Tshiroro, a quantity which each year will largely increase, and thus the question of improved transport becomes very important.\n\nAn effectual check has been given to a chief called Kawinga, whose stronghold is situated on the top of a mountain ten or twelve miles N.N.E. of Domasi, and who for a long time has been a troublesome element in the northern portion of the Shiré Highlands. This town, with its outlying villages, is a rendezvous for slave caravans, and when these want supplies of slaves Kawinga's men commence raiding the adjacent districts. Several of these raids have recently taken place, and the country around the Domasi station of the Church of Scotland's Mission being threatened, and the Mission itself being in danger, a force was despatched from Zomba, which anticipated the raiders, and drove them back to their mountain. An intrenched post has been formed at the point of danger and garrisoned by Sikhs and other troops, which will ensure the safety of Domasi. The force of Kawinga also suffered a reverse on the Upper Shiré, where they had been raiding in another direction, but it is evident there will be no permanent settled peace in the northern portion of the Shiré Province until this chief is removed.

It may be proper where British settlements are surrounded by powerful and fierce nations, like those of Ashantee and Dahomey, for our Government to forbid interference in their affairs lest we should be drawn into conflict with them.

But they are also due in no small measure to the non-observance of the mischievous instructions from the Colonial Office, which left former Governors without any discretion to act in the only manner which men of local experience knew to be necessary.\n\n""It may suit the political theories of people at home, who have no practical acquaintance with the West African Coast, to forbid our representative there to step a yard outside British territory. But it should be remembered that the colony of Sierra Leone was established and for many years maintained at great expense for the express purpose that it might become an emporium of commerce and a means of civilizing the whole of that part of Africa through the extension of its communications with the interior. Unhappily, however, the colony is surrounded by a number of small tribes, who are continually at war with each other, and who thereby prevent traffic across their belt of country to the more peaceable inhabitants and the rich markets of the interior. The trade of Sierra Leone and its dependencies, it must never be forgotten, is essentially a carrying trade. The amount of goods produced or consumed in the colony itself is quite insignificant. Nearly everything that enters or leaves it is intended to reach the interior, many miles distant from British jurisdiction.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British Policy on the Sierra Leone Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As most of our readers are aware, there has been formed in Sierra Leone an association to promote the development of the country, which includes natives of all ranks, with resident Europeans.

This association has also suggested the appointment of native agents in all the treaty districts, whose business it should be to keep the Governor informed of all native movements tending towards war. This would enable him to take effectual action for their suppression, and he should be authorised to use the powers lodged in him for that purpose. Were a plan like this carried out, and not left to the variable notions of successive Governors, many a smouldering fire would be extinguished before it burst into the flames of war.

It may be proper, where settlements are surrounded by powerful and fierce nations, for the Home Government to forbid interference in their affairs, lest we should be drawn into conflict with them. But the case is different in the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone. There the people are divided into a number of very small tribes, and though their wars are sufficient to fill their country with bloodshed and frequently to stop trade, they have never shown inclination or capacity to form anything like a nation. Their wars are all between themselves, and friends and foes are inclined to welcome our interference as arbitrators in their disputes.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position. The trade of the district was gradually passing into the hands of the French, from the want of activity and determination on the part of the British authorities.

But they plead that in the present neglected state of the colony it would not be judicious to make the requisite preparatory arrangements—thus not only inflicting injury on the colony, but also, reflectively, of course, upon the industries of the mother country.\n\nIt has been authoritatively asserted that Her Majesty's Government cannot employ force for the establishment of peace or putting down outrages in countries beyond the jurisdiction of the Crown.\n\nBut inasmuch as the British Government not only claims, but exercises jurisdiction over the waters of the Gambia, by levying taxes on goods ascending and descending that river, it would seem only a matter of right that Her Majesty's subjects, recollecting that in England taxation and protection go together, should either receive, in this instance, protection from the colonial authorities, or that they should celebrate the demise of their authority and power by the removal of all duties and all official impediments and restrictions on the river.\n\nAppealed to by its members on this question, the Chamber can only in its turn make representations to the Colonial Office.

H. K. Karskoth-Hugessen, M.P., Under-Secretary for the Colonies, delivered a lecture on 23rd October, to the members of the Deal and Walmer Institute, on ""The Colonies, and their Government by the Mother Country."" First, he desired to say how entirely he agreed with the opinion implied in the question, ""What would Great Britain be without her colonies?"" There had been from time to time statesmen who had let fall words from which it had been inferred that they regarded colonial possessions at a low value. They had talked of the evils contingent upon such possessions, the vulnerable point for assault which they afford to an enemy in time of war, of the difficulty and delicacy of the relations between a mother country and a dependency; daily increasing in wealth and population; and they maintained that our trade and commerce would be equal in magnitude and extent if each great colony were an independent country. For his part, he differed entirely from such views as these. He thought—nay, he maintained, as an undoubted and incontrovertible fact—that our colonies had been, and still are, of immense service to us; that by their means, the name, the credit, and the prestige of England had been heralded throughout the world; that trade had followed the flag; that by means of them commerce, free of labour for our surplus population, for whatever small force our active spirits had, been, had been opened to us through our colonies; and that it was the duty of every patriotic Englishman to cherish the colonial connection, and to do his utmost to strengthen the tie which bound and united together the mother country and the colonies, to their great and mutual advantage. (Cheers.) He might go even further. There could only be one colonial policy by which any government in this country could stand or fall. Any government which rightly interpreted, and desired duly to represent, the feelings and wishes of the people, must be anxious to cherish and encourage the party at home, and it was little less than a crime for speakers or writers to insinuate that any government desired to alienate the colonies. Such insinuations were only made to serve the object of political partisans, and they might depend upon it that whatever occasional difference there might be in the management of details, any and every British government, from whatever political party it might be chosen, had only one and the same general colonial policy to pursue. (Hear, hear.) Having spoken of the number and position of the British colonies, the manner in which they came into the possession of Great Britain, and the different forms of government which they enjoyed, the honourable gentleman, when dealing with the West Coast of Africa, referred to the somewhat curious fact that while those settlements were originally founded principally for the purposes of the slave trade, they were now, under a wiser and more human policy, made use of for precisely a contrary object—viz., a station from which our efforts might be directed towards the suppression of that cruel and nefarious traffic. These efforts had been attended with very great success. Moreover, these were African settlements which had been centres from which good and brave men had gone forth into the interior of the continent of Africa, and they by their energy and zeal had been created, often at the cost of no means a secondary order of importance, the blessings of Christianity and civilization, and reached those nations who, but for the British settlements, would have still remained in dark and heathen ignorance. (Cheer.) The good work, however, was not yet half done, and there were many obstacles in the way. The missionaries and the civilizing traders had much to contend against, besides the natural difficulty of overcoming native ignorance and prejudice. A committee of the House of Commons sat in 1865 ""to consider the state of the British establishments on the Western Coast of Africa."" After a long and careful inquiry, the committee reported that ""it is impossible to withdraw the British Government wholly or immediately from any settlements or engagements on the West African Coast."" But it went on to say that if further extension of territory or assumption of government, or new treaties offering any protection to native tribes, would be inexpedient, and that the object of our policy should be to encourage in the natives the exercise of those qualities which may render it possible for us more and more to transfer to them the administration of all the governments, with a view to our ultimate withdrawal from all, except, probably, Sierra Leone."" The main object of that committee, which was doubtless actuated by the best possible motives, was to save this country the expense of these settlements, and the complications with native tribes which had occasionally taken place. For his part, however, he could not look forward to any such contingency. He hoped that, in spite of this report of the House of Commons Committee, settlements which had already effected so much good, and through whose agency so much more might still be done, would never be abandoned by Great Britain; and he believed, moreover, that eventually an increasing and developing trade would make their continued occupation more and more desirable on commercial grounds, while there was good reason to hope that before long they might become entirely self-supporting. (Cheers.) . . . Having given a description of the institution of the Colonial-office in London, and remarking that on all the departments able and experienced men were employed, Mr. Hugessen went on to deal with the duties of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, and, replying to questions, he mentioned that during three weeks last session, when members of the Government had to stay up in the House of Commons until one, two, or three in the morning four days out of the seven, the average number of despatches that passed through his hands was 84 a week, or 14 a working day. . . . The Colonial-office, however, was not the only channel through which communications were interchanged between the mother country and the colonies. There were two very important gentlemen called the Crown agents, whose office was in Spring-gardens. They were appointed by the Secretary of State at fixed salaries, and the numerical strength and cost of their clerical staff was fixed by the Treasury. Their office was, in fact, a branch of the Colonial-office, and was most valuable to the colonies. They made no personal profit whatever from their agency, as other agents did, but received either a small fixed annual sum, calculated on the average percentage on business transacted. The duties performed by this branch of the office were of a most important and varied character. . . . In his concluding remarks, Mr. Hugessen said that he had heard how colonial matters were treated in Downing-street, and he was glad to say that he believed such matters were regarded by the public with greater interest than was formerly the case. (Hear, hear.) He earnestly desired to encourage the interests of the colonies, and thus to foster and stimulate political union.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_12_1872#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations. From the past and present history they might reasonably hope for the dawning of still better, brighter, and happier days upon the future of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE EFFECT', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'THE EFFECT of the lately popular laissez-faire policy of the Government with regard to the British colonies and settlements in West Africa is beginning to make itself most unpleasantly realised. For months past it has been pointed out that the French and other European nations were gradually bearing in upon the irregularly defined boundaries of our authority towards the interior; and now the constriction of the annexation band which the recent settlements of the French have completed around the eastern and northern limits of the British sphere in West Africa is beginning to be most painfully felt upon our trade and intercourse with the interior. From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia. The Governor has investigated the circumstances attending the hauling-down of the Union Jack at two stations in the interior. In one case it was found that the district was distinctly under British protection; the other was about ""forty yards outside the British limit."" Doubtless, this is a near thing; but the rule the French, with the rest of our rivals, are in the habit of applying is, that ground which cannot be proved to belong to us must belong to them. Since the downfall of the Spanish Colonial Empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Great Britain has been...\n\ntill lately, the only European Power of the first rank which has devoted its energies to the construction of an Empire outside the geographical limits of its own home. In the absence of rivals, the course has been comparatively clear; and it seems difficult for Governments to realise that all this has been changed during the last two decades. If we would maintain the Empire which has been handed down to us by the enterprise and enthusiasm of the last nine generations, it can only be done by a ready recognition of the fact that other nations around us are only too eager to circumvent our plans, and to take advantage of every slip and inaction on our part.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1893#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
244,"Political instability and conflict in West Africa led to economic disruptions, shifting trade patterns, and declining commodity values in ports like Lagos, Abeokuta, and Old Calabar.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that political instability and conflict in West Africa led to economic disruptions, shifting trade patterns, and declining commodity values in ports like Lagos, Abeokuta, and Old Calabar. The General History of Africa describes the nineteenth-century wars in Yorubaland, which resulted in the destruction of settlements and the movement of populations, leading to the creation of new towns like Ibadan and Abeokuta, thereby disrupting traditional trade routes and economic activities. It also highlights the challenge to the Benin kingdom's trading privileges by European traders and African middlemen, indicating a shift in trade dynamics, although it does not specifically mention declining commodity values in the specified ports. Instead, it notes a transition from the slave trade to legitimate trade, such as palm oil, suggesting a shift rather than a decline in economic activities. In contrast, The African Times articles provide more direct evidence of economic challenges, mentioning the blockade of trade routes in Lagos due to conflicts involving the Jebu and Egba tribes, leading to trade stagnation.

First was the massive enslavement and shipment of Yoruba and related Aja populations to the Americas and, when intercepted by anti-slavery squadrons, Sierra Leone. Within the affected West African localities themselves, socio-political changes of revolutionary character also took place, occasioned by the massive movements of population.$^{26}$ In Yorubaland, the wars led to large-scale destruction of pre-nineteenth century settlements, the foundation of a whole series of new towns and considerable enlargement of existing ones. In the area of Old Qyo, which exemplified the huge loss of population involved, established towns includ› ing the ancient Oyo city itself, Igboho, Ikoyi, Igbon, Iresa and Oje were destroyed. Beyond that, other Yoruba towns destroyed included Sabe, Ketu, Owu and a whole series of Egba and related Remo communities. This created the phenomenon of 'ruined cities' noted by travellers in nineteenth-century Yorubaland. There was a general movement of popu› lation from the troubled interior in the north towards the south. New settlements included Ibadan, Abeokuta, Sagamu, Oke-Odan and Aiyede. The coast and its immediate hinterland, which in c. 1800 was generally sparsely populated, became an area of teeming population at the close of the period.\nIn the Aja-speaking area, the general direction of population movement was south-eastward. In the nineteenth century, Aja refugees from the Werne river valley and the Porto Novo region swelled the ranks of related communities that had earlier settled in the adjacent parts of the presentday Lagos State and Ogun State of Nigeria following the Dahomeyan conquest of the coastal Aja states of Aliada and Whydah in 1724 and 1727 respectively.$^{27}$ This extension of the Aja culture area eastwards was a significant contribution of the nineteenth-century wars to ethnic interpenetration in the area under study."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The decline of the Benin kingdom', 'content': 'Finally, there was the menace posed by European penetration, both through Lagos, the most important centre in the area of Benin influence along the coast, and up the Niger river in the south-east. The Benin kingdom began to feel the embarrassment of this development when its trading privileges in the coastal trade, especially its control over the com¬ merce on the Benin river in the western Niger delta, came to be challenged by European traders, mostly British, and the African middlemen, especially the Itsekiri and the Ijo. The eclipse of the Benin port of Ughoton dem¬ onstrated quite painfully to Benin that the days of its near monopoly of coastal trade had ended.\nThe coastal trade encouraged the spirit of political autonomy among the Itsekiri. This eventually led to a situation of war between the Olu of Warri and the qba of Benin, and the new wealth also nourished political conflicts within the Warri kingdom itself. There was, for example, so much rivalry and acrimony, so many succession disputes, protest migrations and the setting up of autonomous and rival power centres that for the rest of the century no generally acceptable successor could be found for the stool of the Olu of Warri when Akengbua, the incumbent from 1809, died in 1848. As with the Itsekiri kingdom, Agbor, whose monarchy had also been organized on the Benin model and operated as a Benin dependency, grew steadily into an autonomous state again largely under the influence of the new coastal trade. Ovonramwen, the last Oba of independent Benin, was determined to reinvigorate the kingdom and this policy included an expedition against Agbor with a view to re-asserting Benin authority there. The effort was, however, belated; the Benin expeditionary force against Agbor was just taking position at Obadan when the British expeditionary force against Benin itself was reported to be nearing the gate of the capital in 1897.32', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In Sierra Leone, the frustration of the educated classes and the African traders, and the unemployed in the big towns was given open expression in the riots of 1919 in which protests against the price of rice took the form of attacks on Syrian and Lebanese traders, and in the workers' strike that same year. Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy. The looting and the riots spread from Free› town to Moyamba, Kangahun (25-26 July 1919), Mano, Boia, Makump, Bo, Bonthe, Mange and Port Lokko. The situation was so serious that troops had to be brought in from the Gold Coast. In addition to the riots, the technical staff and labourers on the railway and in the public works department went on strike, demanding the same war bonus paid to the government clerical staff, and complaining of low wages and rising food prices.$^{2}$ In The Gambia, too, rising prices had their social and political effects, leading to sporadic outbursts of looting and petty theft, as well as a seamen's strike for better wages, and to the formation of unions, notably the Gambia Native Defensive Union.\nThe 1921 slump also led to more agitation from West African merchants, a few of whom were financially ruined. The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities', 'content': 'But diplomacy and warfare aside, the commonest instrument of policy in inter-state relations was economic.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

Indeed, the first thing to note in connection with nationalist politics in English-speaking West Africa during the inter-war period is the way in which the commercial crises and changes in the colonial economy affected the initiatives and reactions of the colonial elite of lawyers and merchants, the sub-elite of teachers and civil servants, and the workers. For the 'economic revolution' in West Africa not only introduced a mone› tary economy and expanded commerce, it also introduced certain social and economic values among African enterpreneurs and social classes, notably the lawyer-merchant class. Although the position of these classes, particularly the small traders, had begun to change with the development of the colonial economy in the 1890s, it was in reality the First World War and its attendant economic crises which had a more immediate and significant impact on their status. It had been already apparent during the stagnation of the 1880s and the 1890s that the growing sophistication of commerce, expansion of markets, and competition from extra-territorial firms meant that the African businessmen would either have to be more efficient, or play a secondary role in the colonial economy. The First World War, with its economic controls, discriminatory export duties, currency shortages and loss of shipping, created a growing awareness among educated Africans in business and in the professions, that the cosmopolitan days of harmony were over and that the era of the combine and of monopoly capitalism had arrived."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like.

In particular it seems that direct European involvement was counterproductive, as in the failed efforts at agricultural colonization in Waalo between 1819 and 1831,$^{21}$ and in the various efforts in Senegal, the southern Gold Coast, and Nigeria later on.$^{22}$ It was not that European personnel began to loom larger on the African scene; rather, the important change was that Europeans were largely displacing African merchants from The shift from the slave trade to palm oil strengthened the hand of private as against royal merchants (R. Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

The Woolli people, however, attacked him, killed or took prisoners a number of his followers, and drove him into the neighbouring Nyani country, where he is now settled at a place called Toobacouta, and endeavouring to obtain allies from the surrounding tribes. Mamadoo Lanin is said to be a fanatical Mohammedan, and as such would find little difficulty in obtaining recruits among his co-religionists to join in a holy war.

I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST NEWS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Trade dull in the oil rivers, and no prospects of improvement, complications having taken place among native tribes arising out of a dispute between King Amachree, at New Calabar, and one of his chiefs named Will Braid, which progressed to such a point that on the 12th July the latter, after assembling all his people and collecting his goods, withdrew from the town altogether, and proceeded up the country. Here he took possession of the oil markets, and blockaded the creeks, and by these means put a stop to all traffic. Negotiations were in progress for the settlement of the dispute, but it was feared the outbreak would prove a serious matter; and in the event of hostilities taking place, it was anticipated that they would become general, for in Opobo and Bonny both sides would find sympathisers who would render active assistance. In this case the feud would assume much greater dimensions than the long and tedious warfare which followed Ja-Ja\'s secession from Bonny under somewhat similar circumstances several years ago.\n\nThe surf on the Gold Coast was very heavy, and communication was impossible in many places.\n\n(By Benguela, August 29.)\n\nActing-Governor Maloney left Lagos on the 24th July in the colonial steamer Gertrude, and proceeded up the river for the purpose of investigating a charge which had been brought against one of the chiefs of capturing and selling the natives for slaves.

The society was formed among the Imperi in the Isle of Sherbro, part of the colony of Sierra Leone. It originated in a desire for vengeance for the death of a troop of warriors, who while on an expedition were slaughtered by the Imperi. A sorcerer who was consulted devised a fetish called boffima, the owner of which would have all his wishes gratified. It is a tuber, the size of an ostrich\'s egg, which is hollowed out, filled with some secret mixture, and enveloped in leopard\'s hide. To retain its virtue it had to be occasionally greased with human fat. Every candidate for admission to the society undertook to inveigle some relative, slave, or neighbour, to a gathering, at which this stranger was murdered by a member wearing a leopard\'s hide, and the body was eaten.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The General History of Africa emphasizes the transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, such as palm oil, driven by European demand for raw materials. This shift necessitated adaptations in African economic structures, leading to internal social and political changes, and was further complicated by the presence of European traders and missionaries who sought to bypass traditional African middlemen. The strategic importance of trade routes, including those along the Niger River, is underscored by conflicts among African states, such as the Asante's efforts to control coastal trading posts. The text also notes the increased economic value of West Africa due to the demand for commodities like palm oil and rubber, while maintaining that agriculture remained the primary economic activity for most Africans. The African Times articles complement this by highlighting the disproportionate freight charges and costs of maintaining steamers, as well as strategic conflicts with local rulers like the King of Dahomey and competition between European powers, particularly the British and Germans, for control over the Niger trade routes. The articles emphasize the rapid growth in trade volume and the establishment of trading stations, boosting the region's economic importance. However, they lack a deeper exploration of the socio-political effects of trade, which the General History of Africa addresses. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the economic dynamics, strategic interests, and socio-political implications of trade along the Niger River, supporting the claim of its significant impact on African-European economic relations.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding trade along the Niger River and its impact on African-European economic relations in the late 19th century. The text highlights the complexities and imbalances in these relations, particularly through the transition from the slave trade to 'legitimate' trade, such as palm oil, which was driven by European demand for raw materials. This shift required African societies to adapt their economic structures, often leading to internal social and political changes. The presence of European traders and missionaries further complicated these dynamics, as they sought to penetrate interior markets, bypassing traditional African middlemen. The strategic importance of trade routes, including those along the Niger River, is evident in the conflicts and power struggles among African states, such as the Asante's efforts to control coastal trading posts. Additionally, the text notes the increased economic value of West Africa due to the demand for new commodities like palm oil and rubber, which were exported in large quantities to meet European needs. However, the text also emphasizes the continued significance of agriculture as the primary economic activity for most African populations, suggesting that while trade was important, it remained secondary to agriculture in terms of overall economic activity. This nuanced view supports the claim by illustrating both the opportunities and challenges presented by trade along the Niger River in the context of African-European economic relations.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding trade along the Niger River.

Both the Niger, the Cross river and other major rivers of the region were arteries of trade linking peoples along their courses, and receiving goods brought down to them from inland routes such as those passing from the Cross river valley to the Cameroon hinterland and south to the coast.\nEuropean traders along the coast, and gradually up the rivers, made use of the long-established centres of trade on the coast, and received goods brought down from the hinterland. Accordingly, the European presence on the coast became another unifying factor in the history of the region, presenting common problems and stimuli to change. Thus, each of the communities in the region underwent changes or adaptations in their social, political or cultural structures in the face of the external influences and challenge of European intrusion. The factors of European activity included: (i) the slave trade and the effects of its abolition in the nineteenth century; (2) the change to trade in local produce in place of slaves, sometimes referred to as legitimate trade; (3) the entry of Christian missionaries into the region, and (4) the onset of European imperialism and colonial conquest. These factors then, must be analysed in the study of each of the subregions in order to obtain a general idea of the history of the whole region in the nineteenth century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels', 'content': ""The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours.

While statistics are lacking, we may safely estimate that 99 per cent of the population of the region in question was engaged in agriculture, especially the sedentary indigenous peoples. The small minority engaged in trade, apart from artisans, consisted mainly of groups sprung from peoples for whom commerce was a way of life, or peoples interested in conquest; some peoples, like the Joola, com› bined the two activities. In general terms, we may say that the coastal regions essentially imported gold and slaves and supplied European prod› ucts, while the Sahel imported kola nuts and obtained weapons from the coast and exported, for the most part, salt, livestock and slaves.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'These were the major forces determining population change but there were undoubtedly others.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

Trade with Europe had existed before, but the nineteenth century witnessed a massive increase in the scale of this trade with varying effects depending on the structure of Saharan regional economies.

The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sahara in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""The nineteenth century was a time of dramatic change in the desert.

By the end of the century trans-Saharan trade, with the revenue and ready supply of labour it brought, had all but collapsed. The importance of this trade in the lives of nomads suggests the need for further research on the effects of shifts in commerce and its decline: what was the effect of the formation of the state ruled by 'Abd al-Kädir astride a major east-west route? How precisely did desert people react to shifts in commerce? How did declining trade affect resistance? The French occupation of the desert also introduced a new military factor in the relationship between desert oeople and the outside world. The mobility of nomads allowed a number >f options in resistance that might coalesce around Muslim leaders and .eligious orders, but the arid environment often limited the freedom of groups or individuals with shared resources by presenting them with a choice between resistance and survival.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877.

In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another.

Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state.

Up to within a very few years the Western African trade was confined to the seaboard alone, and not until the trade of the Rivers Niger and Congo was seriously entered upon has it made rapid strides; in the last five years it is said to have quadrupled in value. When I visited Africa, there was but one screw steamer a month, and none to the South Coast; the imports and exports by them in 1868 totalled about 28,000 tons; a new steamship company starting at that period in addition to the old company, now possesses 20 steamers, of an aggregate tonnage of 30,000 tons; whilst in 1882, the imports and exports by steam had grown to 200,000 tons, and in addition there are several private mercantile steamers, of a tonnage of 800 to 1,200 tons, constantly running between England and the Niger and the Congo, which rivers are destined to play a much more important part in the development of African commerce, and as long as they are free legitimate commerce will thrive apace. . . . It is certain that Africa, though now reduced to a low state, once had several kingdoms and states famous for arts, for wealth, for power, and for commerce. . . . Amongst the higher and more intelligent people, I met with the signs and symbols of ancient freemasonry; many of the rulers are naturally-born gentlemen; the continent is scored with native roads from sea to sea, over which the internal commerce is very great—a fractional part only being produced and exchanged with the civilized world. The climate in the interior is not insalubrious, and if proper cultivation and the arts of civilized life were introduced again—which can only be done by commerce—it will prove of vast advantage to the Africans and ourselves. (Speaking of the Niger, Mr. Capper said) I estimated the value of the produce brought down, when I went up in 1870, at about £30,000. I believe it now exceeds £2,000,000. It took me twenty-six days to go up the Niger first, now the same distance is easily accomplished in two days. There were then only two factories, now there are fifty-seven. There were only two trading steamers in the river, now there are some twenty steamers, exclusive of several iron lighters, carrying from 30 to 40 tons. One company alone has £57,000 invested in small river craft, and over a million of capital in the Niger. Produce is gathered now that was never gathered before. I passed 105 towns, some with a population of 10,000; but, apart from that, the banks everywhere teemed with life. The end of my expedition was Bidda, 450 feet above the sea, where salt is better than fine gold—yielding greater happiness and luxury. . . . In turning from the Niger to the Congo, it may be right to state that Lagos, a settlement belonging to our British Crown, not twenty-five years old, has a population of 60,000; whilst Loanda, the capital of the Portuguese province of Angola, between 300 and 400 years old, has only 12,000, or is one-fifth the size. The commerce of the Congo is of recent growth. In my time, twelve years ago, there were four English houses, one French and one Dutch, trading up the river as far as Nursuka and Noki; there are now forty-nine European factories on the banks, and the exports and imports are valued at £2,000,000. . . . On the subject of the Congo Treaty, which, it is stated, will not affect the trade of the upper waters, but that the interior trade will be allowed to pass to and fro free, I do not believe anything of the kind; there are more ways of killing a dog than hanging him. There are eighty-seven rules of the most stringent nature scheduled to the treaty; everything is to be written out in a foreign tongue (Portuguese) in a limited time, and everything English literally wiped out. The Portuguese Custom-house officials will, in all probability, insist upon everything being turned out of the ship on to the quay or wharf, weighed, measured, and compared with the manifest; here is a chance for fines and forfeitures, for what Portuguese official would let slip such a splendid opportunity of enriching himself by one big haul? The result will be that the forty-nine factories established on the banks of the Congo will return to the old system of African trade from the ship’s deck. Again, it is said that the same privileges that the subjects of Portugal enjoy are to be extended to the English; but who are the subjects of Portugal there? Convicts, men thankful for small mercies, though they are the most prosperous of Portuguese traders. Men condemned to transportation for murder, and abominations ten times worse, are the largest householders and landowners in the capital—Loanda; and English traders, though they are mere pioneers of commerce, are to be put upon the same platform with such men. . . . To hand over the Congo to the Portuguese Government, that has done nothing, the results of the present mercantile prosperity being due entirely to the large investments of capital and long years of labour, would be a cruel and disastrous act. There are no visible signs of Portuguese authority. . . . Stanley has stated that any Power obtaining the mouth of the Congo would absorb to itself the whole commerce of Central Africa, and supply the wants of a dense population covering one million square miles. The development will be enormous, and the heavy income and property tax and dues, varying from 25 to 125 per cent., on the value of the imports and exports, at the expense of the English merchants, would be a gift to Portugal which it is difficult to understand. What do the Portuguese traders of the Congo themselves say? “What, hand us over to the wretched Portuguese Government!” . . . The *Times* newspaper said, a few weeks ago, that it could not be denied that the best hopes of commerce were involved in the extension of the influence of the International Association, which asks for nothing more than to be allowed to remain the peaceful instrument in bringing various articles of foreign manufacture into the numerous markets that are to be reached by means of the Congo. But before the ink is fairly dry, all good is to be counteracted by the influence of the Portuguese. Without exaggerating the importance of the interior, Commander Cameron states that Africa contains everything that can be desired to make men rich, and that it is replete with vegetable and mineral wealth; the natives make good servants, the climate is delightful, and, but for the Portuguese, everything would be according to the emigrant’s wish. The first time the King of the Belgians came forward in the matter, as far as my memory serves me, was in January, 1876, when his Majesty offered to pay the expenses of Commander Cameron, who was reported to be then in difficulties in Central Africa. Some nine months afterwards a Conference was called of the different Geographical Societies of Europe and from that grew the International African Association. . . . But the great value of the free navigation of the Niger and the Congo is the facilities they will soon afford to the utilization of the inland waters by steamboats, connected with railways which are not difficult to construct, the interior being described as one vast table-land. . . . No doubt the unhealthy seaboard should be avoided, and the establishment of railways projected from the interior. This is an enterprise worthy of British pluck. Extensions would soon follow, north and south, and the interior slave-trade be annihilated. A route for a railway across the desert of Sahara is marked the whole way with the whitened skeletons of those who have perished *en route*. To traverse that desert in twenty-four hours, a journey now requiring four months, and placing the very centre of African civilization within ten days of London, is a feat worthy of the present age. . . . The forests of the interior would supply the necessary wood for sleepers, and such a line could be easily laid at an average rate of one mile per day. Taking the desert as 600 miles broad, it would be two years in building. Labour in the interior is cheap, and the transport of plant by the Congo and Niger not expensive. . . . The length of a railway from the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope, direct, would not be more than one-third of the length of the whole of the railways in Great Britain today, and could be constructed for two millions of money, one-hundredth part only of the cost of our present English railway system, without taking advantage of the great lakes in the interior. A railway so constructed would give two sides to work from, and would form a regular spine through the land. . . . and it would be always valuable, apart from the moral effect and the political force which it would exert, through the heart and centre of the African continent, as affording new outlets for our manufactures. The Niger and the Congo are the present entrances to Africa, and if England is true to its trust, it will not let them be recklessly thrown away.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Present Outlook on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The trade of the Niger is flourishing on account of the enterprise and judgment exercised in its development, but it was only by good luck that the advantages gained by English merchants were not rendered nugatory at the Berlin Conference. It will be remembered that a strong effort was made to bring this river, on which both Government and private money had been lavished, where order has been maintained for years by British men-of-war, where also British rule was paramount, an effort was made to place all this British capital and enterprise under international control similar to that instituted for the Congo. Herr Flegel and his companions have endeavoured to take advantage of the colonizing fever from which Germany has been suffering to raise up a company in Germany to take advantage of the Niger being free to all to use it for the approach to its principal affluent, the Benue, and make that a preserve for German traders. He alleged that he had made treaties with many chiefs, and that their country had been ceded to him and placed under the protection of the German Empire. English enterprise, backed by mercantile prudence and foresight, has established trading stations in terms of amity with the natives, and negotiated binding treaties with the chiefs, so that now, when Herr Flegel and his compatriots again put in their appearance on the Benue, they will find their hopes of founding a German colony there somewhat difficult of accomplishment.\n\nIt is to be hoped in the interests of trade and good order that as Great Britain has now declared herself responsible for good order on the Niger, she will maintain an efficient staff for that purpose, and prevent trouble between the native chiefs and the traders, and not only despatch a punitive expedition after outrages have taken place. The Niger penetrating into Mohammedan and partially civilized countries, has a great advantage in the demand for manufactures over rivers, the inhabitants of whose banks are savages, ignorant of wants, and only wear clothing to satisfy the whim and fancy of the moment. The future of the Niger trade now looks bright and prosperous, but it is mainly so because the whole of the trade is practically centred in the hands of a corporation so rich and powerful as to be able to defy all competition.\n\nAfter the Gold Coast, Lagos, and the Niger, the next most important place to England, though not possessing the largest trade, is Sierra Leone and its dependencies of Bathurst and Sherbro'. Sierra Leone has been called the White Man's Grave, but though, no doubt, the climate is enervating and unhealthy, it is no worse than many a place where white populations live and thrive, and if there were more energy and life in the people, the evil effects of the climate would be much less felt than they are at present."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1885#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NIGER TRADE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The banks of the Upper River are in the hands of a people of the Mahomedan religion, which is an advantage to trade, as their religion cherishes some distinction between meum and tuum.

The Europeans and the Western Soudanese are getting into better and better relations with each other. The former have greatly changed the character of the trade in this region, which used to be carried across country in large caravans. According to Herr Flegel, traders used to realize 500 and 600 per cent. on their transactions, and even now, in over-crowded markets, 100 per cent. is easily obtained. The transport of ivory by way of Kuka and Kano is almost entirely done away with. The monopoly of the United African Company, which lasted but a short time, ruined many single traders in ivory. Down to 1879 the caravan people, in returning with ivory, had presents pressed upon them by buyers to induce them to trade; after 1879 the caravaners had to solicit sale from the company and accept one-fifth the price they used to receive a few months before. But, fortunately, besides ivory, there are other native products capable of great development, and not at all likely to be exhausted—the various palm products, Shea butter, sesame, oil, cotton, skins, wax, potash, Kola nuts, potters\' ore, &c.\n\nHerr Flegel gives the following list of the principal Niger trading companies of the present time: 1. The United African Company (Limited), with about thirty factories, extending from the river mouth to Rabba (recently destroyed), on the Upper River, and including one on the Binué.

It has, as far as known to Herr Flegel, eight factories—one at Brass, at the mouth of the Rio Bento, and the furthest up at Eggan. It has two steamers, two lighters, and a steam launch. 3. Crowther Brothers, sons of the Bishop, with one small steamer. 4. Mr. Scott, with one steam launch. 5. Mr. Lees, a native trader of Lagos, with an old steamer chartered. 6. Mr. Lander, in Brass, apparently connected with Mr. Lees. There are other firms in Brass, but their trade is restricted to the locality and to the palm oil brought to them by the Brass people for sale. 7. Mr. Phillips, navigating the Niger in a canoe till a steamer arrives. 8. M. Viard, formerly in the service of Count de Semellé. M. Viard has gone to France with a cargo of ivory, but factories are being built for him, and agents are busy in his interests.

Yet the development of the trade on the Niger during the past fifty years might teach us a salutary lesson with regard to the opening-up of the Congo. Unprotected by any European Powers, we believe, the trade on the Niger has been permitted to develop under the healthy stimulus of open competition, and now its banks are studded with trading stations of various nationalities, chiefly English, and its waters ploughed by numerous steamers and fleets of canoes. In a paper read at the Society of Arts [see African Times, May, p. 63] in April, by Mr. Robert Capper, who spent several years both on the Niger and the Congo, an interesting sketch of the growth of the Niger trade during the past fifty years, was given, from the first fatal attempt of M'Gregor Laird down to the present day. For the past five years an enterprising German explorer, Herr Robert Flegel, has been at work on the Niger on behalf of the German African Society. He has been able greatly to extend our knowledge of the river and its tributaries. He has discovered the sources of the great affluent, the Binué, which, with the main stream itself, forms the highway into the heart of the Soudan. Herr Flegel has an eye to the commercial interests of his country, and has sent home a report of great value, giving details as to the trade on this great river (which is as long as the Rhine from its mouth to Switzerland), and of the trading firms having stations on its banks. We have on several occasions drawn attention to the doings of the French on the Upper Niger; they have at last succeeded in extending their Senegambian domains to the banks of the river at Segu, a long way above Timbuctoo, and large sums have been voted for the construction of railways to the interior. Their object is to tap the Niger trade at its source; and the traders in the central and lower reaches of the river will doubtless make them welcome to all they may obtain in this way, even with all the advantages of their monopolizing treaties with the neighbouring chiefs. The Binué seems scarcely less important than the Niger itself, and, as Mr. Capper told the Society of Arts, there is a piece of British land at the confluence of the two rivers which carries with it the right of navigation."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE IN THE NIGER REGION', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Whatever may be the result of the Conference at Berlin, one important advantage will have been gained—viz., the opening of the eyes of Great Britain to the unassisted part that she has played during the past fifty years in the development of Central Africa north of the equator, and to her rights and duty to continue to act as the protector of the Lower Niger and Binue rivers, which, with their important tributaries, form one system which I will designate as the Niger-Binue. This term is in contradistinction to the Upper Niger, from Timbuctoo to the sources, which runs for a distance of 1,000 miles at the back of the French colony of Senegal, and which has been visited by several French exploring parties, though as yet no European trade has been opened there. Nor, indeed, can such trade be carried on profitably until the completion of the railway connecting the waterways of the Senegal and the Upper Niger. Between the latter and the Niger-Binue lies the long stretch of the Middle Niger, from Timbuctoo to Boussa; nature thus interposing a barrier of 800 miles between the Upper Niger basin, which will probably fall to France, and the Niger-Binue basin, which is already occupied by Great Britain. The Niger-Binue was unknown to Europe fifty-five years ago. The wildest theories were held as to the ultimate destination of the Niger—some geographers holding that it was absorbed by an inland sea, others that it fell into the Nile, others that it joined the Congo. The English traveller, John Lander, in 1831 solved the problem by starting from Badagry, and travelling northwards till he reached the Niger, near Boussa, where are the lowest rapids, and where commences the Niger-Binue system. He followed the river down 600 miles to the sea. Immediately on his return home, in 1832, his great discovery was turned to account by some Liverpool merchants, who despatched two steamers to nearly the highest navigable point on the Niger, and to Dagbo on the Binue. Numerous private expeditions from this country followed in the years 1834 to 1864, the most notable event being the formation in 1852 of the African Steamship Company, which established a line to Lokoga at the confluence of the Niger and Binue, 300 miles from the sea. Meanwhile the British Government had made efforts to open up both branches, and to lay down charts. Under an impulse given by Prince Consort, Parliament voted over £50,000 for the expedition of Her Majesty’s ships Albert, Wilberforce, and Soudan, during which the Government obtained the cession of a large tract of country about the confluence at Lokoga, where the British flag flies to this day. Another important expedition was that of 1854-5, during which were laid down most careful charts of the Binue for some hundreds of miles. In 1857 Parliament voted a five years' subsidy, averaging £7,000 a year, to Mr. Macgregor Laird, to assist him in developing trade in these rivers, and it was expressly stated on that occasion that immediate results could not be expected, but that posterity would reap the benefit. In a letter dated the 29th April, 1864, Earl Russell stated that he was willing to recommend a further subsidy of £6,000 for the same object. The proposal fell through—indeed, was rendered unnecessary by the springing up of British trade, which has lasted to the present day."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger Territory and its Commerce', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This is one of the greatest of African streams, called by the Arabs the Nile of the Blacks, and by the dwellers on its bank identified with the river of Egypt.

Its course is through regions where civilization and prosperity increase in proportion to remoteness from the sea, for its upper waters drain those native kingdoms of the Western Soudan where alone the negro has proved capable of developing a stable social organization.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The interior, on the other hand, is healthy, and the trade can be carried on directly, without the intervention of native agency.

This region is thickly populated; the rivers are navigable all the year round, and only for a few months do the waters shallow at certain places,—a disadvantage easily overcome by suitably-built craft.\n\nAfter the wreck of Laird's plantation schemes the trade on the Niger grew up very slowly, and was often brought to a standstill in the dry season, when communication with the coast was cut off. Still, during this season, the profits were enormous, and quite sufficient to compensate for the risks run by the traders, who mostly lived in hulks moored on the river. The great profits derived from trade during the dry season caused over-crowding and over-competition for a time, and brought the Niger trade to the verge of ruin. It was, however, revived by two Englishmen, who formed an amalgamated company, developed new branches of trade, and established a large number of new factories. The Binué was opened up to commerce, and vessels were built capable of plying on both rivers all the year round. The survivor of these partners is at present the chief agent of the United African Company. Now in the dry or winter months the traveller encounters everywhere the zinc-roofed factories, or clear spaces occupied by large oblong houses. At least two vessels are constantly navigating these waters, besides the steam launch of the chief agent, which can run in two-and-a-half days from the sea to the remotest factories."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Navigation of the River Niger', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, I need not enlarge on the moral results which we hope will follow upon our efforts, if we are able to carry out our views.

Expeditions are rapidly following one another and giving us full information about the interior of Equatorial Africa. Railways and canals are proposed for the opening up of that part of Africa, and they will, years hence, no doubt, prove an incalculable benefit; but why should we wait for these costly works? Why not utilize the arteries already provided by nature for traffic with the interior? Northwest Africa is a market to a great extent as yet unworked. The markets of Sego and Timbuctoo, Hamdallahi, and other large towns on the Upper Niger are most inadequately supplied with British goods by caravans from Tunis, Tripoli, Mogador, and Senegal, and the carriage is so expensive that none but the lightest and most valuable can be imported across the desert. Now the French river, Senegal, though it drains the country for over 700 miles, is practically useless as a channel of commerce. It has a bad and dangerous bar. Ships have often to lie outside weeks, and even months, waiting to enter the port of St. Louis. Its channel into the interior is full of sand bars and rocks, obstructing navigation by even small craft for most of the year; and the tribes to the north-east of its head-waters, of Arab origin, are ferocious and predatory, living by plunder; therefore, commerce meets with danger and difficulty in their neighbourhood. About 180 miles to the south is the Gambia, which seems intended by nature to be the main road for commerce, civilization, and religion into North-west Africa. At all states of the tide, at all seasons of the year, you have a deep and safe channel over the bar; vessels of 2,000 to 3,000 tons can come in and anchor off Bathurst, and discharge and load. The traffic up the river is carried on by large cutters and schooners. Even oceangoing vessels of large tonnage go up to M\'Carthy Island, 185 miles from the mouth, and load. Lately, an ocean steamer, of about 900 tons, went there direct from Marseilles, and loaded there; and at the present moment, a French firm trading in Gambia is building a 1,200-ton steamer to run between Marseilles and that island every season, and discharge and load there, instead of breaking bulk at Bathurst. At M\'Carthy Island there are five fathoms of water in mid-channel. Then, vessels drawing ten feet of water can go up to Yarbutenda, 160 miles further; so that had we steamers suited for the trade, like the French vessels I have mentioned, they could load at Liverpool or London, reach Bathurst in twelve days, M\'Carthy Island in twenty-four hours, Yarbutenda in twenty-four hours more, making fourteen days in all.""', 'last_edit_date': '1879-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1879#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following communication has been sent to us.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

The Court of Mixed Commissions was also set up at Freetown, Sierra Leone, to try the captains of captured slave ships, and to set free the slaves of condemned slavers. For the delta states, these developments meant the demonstration of British power in their waters, bringing the era of gunboat diplomacy in which the British consuls used naval power to negotiate favourable conditions for British traders, missionaries, and explorers. In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

These covered a large part of Tanzania and, on a smaller scale, western Kenya. Traditional rulers who were able to control the trade were also able to accumulate the imported goods with which to build up a large army and to expand administrative machinery. Weaker states were either raided for slaves or annexed to form larger entities. In these areas the effect was either constructive in that it enabled certain rulers to build up bigger kingdoms in areas previously supporting smaller states, or destructive in the sense that it encouraged rebellion, which in turn destroyed the unity of the states that existed. Despite this generalization, the effect of the long-distance trade was generally destructive. There is no need to detail here the evils of the trade in human beings. But even the value of the material base built on imported goods was deceptive. Most of these goods were luxury items: beads, bracelets and other ornaments. What was useful was cloth, but even this competed with local sources of production which were eventually destroyed. Worse still, the trade in luxury goods and the general violence caused by the need to raid other societies in order to maintain the trade, meant neglect of subsistence agriculture. It is unlikely that the new structure could have been maintained even if colonialism had not intervened. In fact few of the large states built up during this period survived intact to the 1890s.\nIn order to illustrate this general picture it will be necessary to look briefly at the three caravan-route regions. In discussing the Kamba, we noticed how even their control of trade declined when raiding for slaves became prominent. The Kamba were a non-centralized society. The long› distance trade probably encouraged an enlargement of scale of various traditional institutions, beginning with kinship, village age-group and defence organizations. But none of these became the basis for a centralized state structure.

The sooner this is looked to by the Acting Governor at Lagos, or by the new Governor, should Mr. Stanhope Freeman not return there, the better. If those duties cannot be levied without diverting the trade to Porto Novo, they had better be at once repealed, or reduced to such an amount as can be levied without thus injuring the trade of the port.

The object in view as regards revenue at Lagos should be, not to impede, but to foster commerce; and especially that commerce which attends and stimulates progressive civilization. It should be, not to raise an excessive revenue that may be profligately squandered, but to obtain what will suffice to render the colony permanently independent of the mother country as regards everything but mere protection, and give at the same time an adequate fund for those improvements which ought to take place under our rule.

Since that time there has been a restlessness on the part of the Executive, which has been unmitigatedly evil in its tendency. He is stated to have allowed a petition to be got up by certain dependents of the Government, calling upon him to annex Porto Novo and its territories. By sundry unnecessary and threatening voyages in the colonial steamer, attended by a force of Houssas, &c., he has given colour to the belief that he has such plans in contemplation; and considering what took place in the years 1864-1867, it is not surprising that merchants and traders, the whole of whose property would be imperilled and destroyed by a renewal of the overt and secret acts of policy then committed, should even give credit to the report of their Administrator having allowed his feelings of hostility against the Egba nations so far to prevail with him over all just, honourable, humane, and politic considerations, as to induce him privately to instigate the Kings of Dahomey and Ibadan conjointly to attack, and if possible destroy Abeokuta during the present dry season.\n\nThe proper policy of Lagos, as a great emporium of trade for extensive inland countries, must manifestly be to cultivate amicable relations with all of them, and scrupulously to abstain from everything that could give rise to suspicions of hostile feelings or intentions as regards any of them.

We believe that it never will be convenient; that the correspondence could not bear the strong light of unofficial truth that we could bring to bear upon it. There was not, there never could have been any just grounds for putting in force such an ordinance during the past few months. But this denial of placing official correspondence on such local matters before the House of Commons, which has now become a constant Colonial-office practice, is one that cannot be in any way justified; one that we protest against; and one that we shall make all possible effort to put an end to. It is so absurd that it will not bear examination, that in matters connected with small crown colonies and settlements such as those of West Africa, the Colonial-office should place itself on a par with the Foreign-office; and in matters which affect only the appreciation of conduct of a local administrator in his relations with the people over whom he rules, or the uncivilised countries adjoining, and which are alleged by the persons interested in the trade of the place to be most dangerous and disastrous to their legitimate pursuits, should be allowed to avail themselves of the same reasons for the non-production of papers, that the Foreign-office are allowed to plead regarding incomplete negotiations with powerful civilised states, which may possibly involve the peace of the world. It is, we repeat, ridiculous and unworthy a member of a British Administration, to place such a plea on record, in such a matter as whether there were sufficient grounds to justify Her Majesty\'s Government in permitting their servant at Lagos to endanger the prosperity of trade, in a place so entirely commercial, by such a course as he has of late pursued with regard to neighbouring native countries, on good accord with which the commercial prosperity of Lagos wholly depends. This denial of papers in such cases, possibly until after the erring local official shall have done irreparable injury, ruined the fortunes of many honest traders, and caused serious losses to those connected with them, is so great a grievance that we do not despair of getting it brought under the consideration of the Legislature, in a way that will lead to the adoption of some reasonable bounds for the practice, if not to its being got rid of altogether.

Pope Hennessy, Esq., Administrator-in-Chief of the West African Settlement.**\n\nThe merchants and traders of the Settlement of Lagos beg to be allowed to bring to your notice the following facts, which materially affect their interests as a commercial community.\n\nLagos is the natural port for a very large portion of Central and Western Africa, comprising the whole of the thickly-populated and industrious kingdoms of the Jebus, Yorubas, and Egbas, including the many tribes on and beyond the banks of the Niger to the northward of Porto Novo, and Wetu to the westward, and the important commercial districts of Palma and Leckie to the eastward. It is necessary, for the purpose of developing the resources of these countries, that all the roads leading to them should be kept perfectly free and open, and it is their opinion that an end so desirable can only be attained by a policy, on the part of this Government, of non-interference in the politics of the surrounding countries, in which Lagos can have no possible concern. For some time past the policy of non-intervention has been disregarded, and one of an opposite character substituted, which has led to a stoppage of the Abeokuta roads, and threats of immediate closing of others. The policy of intervention above-mentioned is exemplified by following facts.\n\nIn the latter part of 1869 a blockade of Iheri was established by Tywo, who left Lagos openly with an armed expedition for the purpose of recovering his own debts; on his arrival, he seized several persons (about twenty) as hostages, took them to Ikorudu, and kept them until part of his debts were paid.\n\nThe blockade lasted six months, and was detrimental to trade in Lagos, and only beneficial to Tywo himself, all business with Iheri being stopped, and his monopoly complete. One incident occurred as follows: About thirty Lagos traders went to Iheri, but on the way, beyond the jurisdiction of this Government, a Lagos constable challenged the party, which disavowed his authority and proceeded to the market; on their return, they were arrested and taken to Government House, and subsequently imprisoned for one month by the police magistrate.\n\nTywo, who is a native trader of great influence, has been further supported by this Government on many occasions, to the detriment of independent trade here. For instance, about two months ago, he stopped all Egba trade except through Iheri, forcing Egba traders to sell at that market instead of coming themselves to Lagos, and only allowing those canoes to pass down that were directed to his factory here. A new measure of produce was introduced here, which met with great opposition on the part of the natives, but it was enforced by the constable sent from Lagos; some leading merchants here complained to the Government of this interference, and offered direct proof of the facts, but could obtain no satisfaction.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_06_1872#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Little War in Porto Novo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are sorry to learn, by latest intelligence from Lagos, not only that there is a domestic war at Porto Novo between two sets of Princes there, but that the Egbas have been so ill advised as to side with one of the parties against the other, and send an armed expedition to Porto Novo in aid of one of the contending parties.

In 1862 the imports amounted to £77,932, and the exports to £61,933; last year (1891) the imports were £607,718, and the exports £716,642. Lagos trade is subject to fluctuations, among other reasons, owing to the eccentric conduct of the middlemen from the interior, whose arbitrary demands and exactions have from time to time blocked the routes upon which the trade of the Colony depends.**\n\n""It is evident that in a trade which has its foundation on the barter system the value and quantity of the imports must vary directly with the exports. There is of late years a growing tendency on the part of the native, even in the remote interior, to employ silver currency for his transactions in place of direct barter or the cumbrous method of transporting vast quantities of cowrie shells from market to market. Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods. The attention of the natives has been directed lately to the importance of developing minor industries. Among these may be mentioned the cultivation of cocoa and coffee, which has been taken up both by the natives and, in one\n\nFor instance, on a large scale, by European enterprise. Even more importance is now attached to cotton, which is cultivated in large quantities in the interior of Yoruba for home manufacture. During the current year one of the obstructing tribes who prevented direct communication with the ""hinterland"" has been forced to open its roads, and it is to be hoped that the shipments of cotton, which amounted to 379,300lb., of a value at the port of shipment of £4,825 6s. 10d., during the past year, will in 1893 be very largely increased.

562,"Persistent native conflicts and colonial non-intervention policies severely hindered Sierra Leone's economic development and trade by causing widespread destruction, depopulation, and disruption of commerce.","The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that persistent native conflicts and colonial non-intervention policies severely hindered Sierra Leone's economic development and trade. The textbook highlights the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898, where the Temne and Mende people rose against British colonial rule, disrupting commerce and economic activities. It emphasizes the colonial administration's active role in imposing taxes and monopolizing mineral resources, excluding Africans from economic benefits, and notes internal conflicts like the 1919 riots and strikes, which further affected economic stability. However, it does not explicitly mention colonial non-intervention policies as a hindrance. In contrast, The African Times articles detail the devastation caused by continual wars among chiefs since 1858, leading to the destruction and depopulation of towns, which disrupted commerce and trade. The articles criticize the colonial authorities' reluctance to intervene in native affairs, citing a governor's refusal to stop tribal wars due to instructions from home, which is seen as destructive to trade and prosperity. Despite mentions of some intervention efforts by governors like Sir Samuel Rowe, the articles largely support the claim by emphasizing the detrimental effects of native conflicts and limited colonial intervention on Sierra Leone's economic development. Together, these sources illustrate the complex interplay of native conflicts, colonial policies, and economic challenges in Sierra Leone's history.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide several insights related to the claim about Sierra Leone's economic development and trade. The Hut Tax rebellion of 1898 is highlighted as a significant native conflict, where the Temne and Mende people rose against British colonial rule, leading to attacks on trading stations and British officials. This rebellion suggests a disruption of commerce and economic activities, aligning with the claim of native conflicts affecting trade. However, the text does not explicitly mention colonial non-intervention policies as a factor in hindering economic development. Instead, it emphasizes the colonial administration's active role in imposing taxes and monopolizing mineral resources, which excluded Africans from economic benefits. Additionally, the text discusses the frustration of educated classes and traders in Sierra Leone, leading to riots and strikes in 1919, further indicating internal conflicts affecting economic stability. While the text does not directly address depopulation or widespread destruction as hindrances to economic development, it does highlight the exclusionary practices of colonial rule and the resulting economic hardships. Therefore, the text partially supports the claim by illustrating native conflicts and disruptions in commerce but does not fully align with the notion of colonial non-intervention policies being a primary cause.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that persistent native conflicts and colonial non-intervention policies severely hindered Sierra Leone's economic development and trade. The articles describe the devastation caused by continual wars among chiefs since 1858, leading to the destruction and depopulation of towns, which in turn disrupted commerce and trade. The reports highlight the negative impact of native feuds and wars on Sierra Leone's trade, noting that these conflicts have led to a depression in commerce and hindered the colony's prosperity. Additionally, the articles mention the reluctance of colonial authorities to intervene in native affairs, as seen in the refusal of a governor to join efforts to stop a war between tribes, citing instructions from home. This non-intervention policy is criticized for being destructive to trade and prosperity. Furthermore, the articles discuss the impact of these conflicts on the colony's revenue and the challenges faced in reviving trade and ensuring peace. However, there are also mentions of efforts by certain governors, like Sir Samuel Rowe, to stop native wars and revive trade, suggesting some level of intervention that contrasts with the claim of complete non-intervention.

As one district commissioner reported in April 1898, 'The object appears to be the massacre of all Sierra Leoneans (i.e. the Creoles of Freetown) and Europeans and thoroughly it is being done. The country is destroyed as regards Trade - several traders being killed and places burnt'.$^{62}$ By May 1898, the rebel armies were within about 40 km of Freetown and two companies of troops had to be hastily brought in from Lagos to defend the town.\nWhat was the true nature of this revolt? The British governor of Sierra Leone, who was stunned by the rebellion, attributed not only that rebellion but the general resistance to colonial rule that was raging at the time to 'the growing political consciousness of the African, and his increasing sense of his worth and autonomy'. As he put it, 'the native is beginning to feel his strength from the value that is set on him for the products of his country and his labour by the white man and in future the latter will not be able to trade so much on his simplicity and ignorance of the world as in the past'.$^{63}$ Governor Cardew's analysis cannot be faulted and is equally true of most of the rebellions and guerrilla wars that occurred in West Africa between the late 1890s and 1914."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Minerals', 'content': 'With the exception of a few cases, mineral resources were exploited with foreign capital. Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour.

By 1827, however, an embryonic development process had started.

An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper. Here again, the main interest lay in the creation of a reliable economic substitute for the slave trade: in 1824 fifty Western ships loaded 200000 dollars' worth of timber in the Sierra Leone estuary.$^{38}$ Favourable conditions combined to create a certain amount of wealth (it can hardly be described as capital) within the colony.

In 1921, a large number of miners at Luishi, for example, walked off the job and proceeded to Elizabeth ville to complain to government officials of ill-treatment and poor rations. Two years later a similar work stoppage occurred at the Kakontwe mines. 53 The Depression created new economic uncertainties.

Mr. Lawson, the gentleman despatched on that mission, reports that all the towns have been destroyed by fire, and are at this moment heaps of ruins, presenting a lamentable sight for any one who has previously known them. Quite depopulated, with the exception of here and there a few huts, occupied by starving people, the dense and solitary forest is rapidly enveloping them. This sad state is the result of continual wars among the chiefs since 1858.\n\nIt is said that, having destroyed and almost depopulated their country, they are now tired of war and bloodshed, and desire influential mediation among them. Can nothing be done for the permanent tranquillity of these districts? The scattered people are selling the members of their families and their dependents in order to obtain food and supplies of articles which they need. Surely it would be in the interests of humanity to obtain the voluntary consent of all the chiefs to an acknowledgment of a supreme authority, whose counsels and commands should maintain peace and order among them. If, as the Sierra Leone journals assert, there are large supplies of palm-oil, beniseed, camwood, African teak timber, &c., to be procured in those parts of the river, notwithstanding the melancholy state to which the country is reduced, it is evident that, with assured peace and order, and the increase of population which would accompany these, wealth and happiness might soon abound in those districts. The trade of Sierra Leone would increase by measures being taken to make those people prosperous. Civilization ought to be pushed forward up the river from Sierra Leone. It is evident that something more than the mere occupation of the mouth of the river and the immediately contiguous territory is indispensable to order and progress.\n\nSierra Leone, like the Gambia, has been almost stripped of troops, in order to furnish what, after all, is the miserably insufficient regular force now available at the Gold Coast for the Ashantee war.\n\nThe colony is in a very healthy state.\n\nWe are glad to see by the journals that the Rev. J. W. Davison, who was lecturing for some time about London and in other parts of this country, had arrived out. It is said that he has been offered the superintendence of the Baptist connexion in the colony, and has accepted it.

The government of our country by an officer whose administration, we are confident, is identified with the true and real policy of benevolent Britain towards Africa—Sir Arthur Edward Kennedy—has done much to bring about the many happy results that have graced the history of Western Africa in 1868, and patriotic Africans cannot fail to revere, love, and respect him; in fact, so much has he secured the confidence of the public here, that it is not long since a reverend gentleman in a public meeting called him ""Arthur the Good.""\n\nThe year which has just expired witnessed a fine and once prosperous country, situate on the north of Sierra Leone, harassed and desolated by a civil war, by which Sierra Leone was famished, because her chief produce for export and home consumption was derived from the surrounding countries. The new Governor-in-Chief saw at once the very damaging effect of native raids and massacres dignified by the name of ""War."" He proffered his good offices; and within the very short space of two months of his arrival here, Sir Arthur Kennedy succeeded in effecting a peace between the belligerent natives. The Moriah land, which had been desolated for three years, is now enjoying peace and likely to recover her former prosperity; and the colony of Sierra Leone, also, has regained, in a great measure, her usual activity and vigour, although we are under some apprehension that the encroachment of the French nation in that country may prove a heavy and serious loss to this colony.\n\nThe political historian of Western Africa, Mr. Editor, would not do justice to this country if he were to pass over in silence events which have lately taken place at the River Volta. The ascent of this noble river by steamer has been reserved for the enterprising Governor Kennedy, who crossed the bar in the colonial steamer Eyo, ably commanded by the Lieut.-Governor of Lagos, Captain Glover, R.N., and ascended in November last as far as Bartoh, distant between sixty and seventy miles from the bar. It is not surprising that the primitive tribes on the banks of the river were seen trying, by their hands and gestures, to imitate the ""smoke ship,"" which they for the first time saw in their river; and some of them were actually racing on foot with the steamer.\n\nThe moral effect produced on the natives by the ""smoke ship"" is said to be very great, and we hope will conduce to permanent peace in those wealthy eastern districts of the Gold Coast.'}, {'id': 3598, 'article_title': 'Important Memorial from Sierra Leone', 'full_section_title': 'Important Memorial from Sierra Leone', 'last_edit_date': '06-12-1878', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1878#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_07_1878', 'content': '11.

Your memorialists will advert to the great depression to which the commerce of Sierra Leone has for the past eight years been subject, and that, amongst other causes of that depression, is the existence of native feuds and wars around us; that the policy of preceding administrations had been to extend into, and protect in, the interior countries the trade of this settlement, which provides not only means of livelihood for the majority of the people, but also the funds by which the local government is upheld. The position and extent of Sierra Leone, its geographical relations to surrounding countries, the natural aptitude of the inhabitants, perhaps developed by the example of the early as well as later European colonists, render it a strictly commercial community, and it seems to your memorialists that any Governor who aims to destroy instead of cultivating this commercial tendency will struggle long with disappointment of his views, unless his object be also to ruin the settlement.\n\n13. Your memorialists do not charge his Excellency with such an object, but what they do contend is that to have made his above-cited speech to a people through whose country a large portion of the trade with the interior is carried on, and who, without the influence of this settlement, would interfere with and divert the trade by vexatious quarrels and absurd imposts, is to render our social, commercial, and political relations with the interior tribes insecure, to expose to great danger the lives and property of British subjects who go amongst them to seek honest employment, and, by infusing contempt in the minds of the aborigines towards the Africans under British rule, to undermine all the good results of British philanthropy, and awaken in the native mind a mistrust of the moral and civilizing influences of the British people, and a consequent disposition to withdraw from the operation of those influences.'}, {'id': 5176, 'article_title': 'Our Policy on the Sierra Leone Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Our Policy on the Sierra Leone Coast', 'last_edit_date': '08-01-1885', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-14', 'issue_date': '01_08_1885', 'content': 'The following letter has such an important bearing upon the present state of Sierra Leone that we print it in its entirety from the *Times*:\n\n""**Sir**—You were good enough on the 8th of January last to insert a letter of mine in relation to the policy of our Government in the countries which adjoin our newly-acquired territories between British Sherbro and the Republic of Liberia on the West Coast of Africa.

But it should be remembered that the colony of Sierra Leone was established and for many years maintained at great expense for the express purpose that it might become an emporium of commerce and a means of civilizing the whole of that part of Africa through the extension of its communications with the interior. Unhappily, however, the colony is surrounded by a number of small tribes, who are continually at war with each other, and who thereby prevent traffic across their belt of country to the more peaceable inhabitants and the rich markets of the interior. The trade of Sierra Leone and its dependencies, it must never be forgotten, is essentially a carrying trade. The amount of goods produced or consumed in the colony itself is quite insignificant.

It has been compiled by Mr. G. F. Scott-Elliott and Miss Catherine A. Raisin, and deals exhaustively with the botany and geology of that Colony. One or two of the matters with which it deals may be noted. Sugar-cane is cultivated, and seems suited to the climate, and the £3,500 worth of sugar imported by the Colony in 1890 may—the authors of the report state—be easily produced on the spot. Arrowroot grows exceedingly well; indeed, that of Sierra Leone is claimed to be the best in the world. But unfortunately the market has been spoilt because the Natives adulterated the flour with cassada and would not clean it properly. African flax or bow-string hemp is extremely common in the district. Its excellent character is well known, but so far the difficulty of preparing it for the market has not been overcome, and it is suggested that the processes of cleaning might be improved by first passing the leaves lengthwise through two horizontal rollers placed close together. Banana fibre is also referred to. As fibre, it can, perhaps, scarcely compete with other substances, but has scarcely yet had a fair practical trial. Usually the old stems are cut into four, lengthwise, the soft heart is taken out, and the pieces, after being left lying two or three days, are passed lengthwise through two horizontal rollers and washed. A tree yields about 4 lbs. of fibre, which is worth from £12 to £20 a ton. Waste stems might be profitably utilised in this way, though a plantation for fibre purposes could scarcely pay. There should be a large export trade in bananas, which sell at about 8d. a bunch. The authors think that with good roads, the supply of rubber from the Colony may be doubled or even quadrupled in amount, while the demand for this most useful article is capable of almost endless expansion.

It arrived too late to save Keniera, but Samadu's entrenched camps were stormed and his army, numbering about 5,000 men, dispersed in every direction. The war thus commenced was continued through the years 1882 and 1883, with uniform success on the part of the French against overwhelming odds, and the Sofas were gradually driven southwards. The repeated defeats he had experienced now made Samadu chary of coming into further collision with the French, for it is only by success that an adventurer such as he can keep together his heterogeneous following; and finding that the heathen tribes to the north were effectually protected by the French, he, in 1884, carried his raids southward into Sulimania and districts which are now placed within the sphere of British influence. In 1884 he captured and destroyed Falaba, the capital of Sulimania, and the great emporium for the trans-Niger trade, and devastated a vast tract of country. Thousands of natives were slain, thousands more were sold into slavery, and the country was so depopulated that trade came to a standstill, and the colony of Sierra Leone was reduced to the verge of bankruptcy. These conquests brought a fresh accession of strength to Samadu, and in 1885 he again commenced operating against the French provinces, but sustained in that year a severe defeat near Siguiri, and in the year following a still more severe defeat at Malinkamori, the result of which was that, in February 1887, he signed a treaty of peace with the French, in which he recognised that the River Niger was the boundary between his territory and that of the French.""}]","[{'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Intestine wars had broken out amongst the natives in the Mellicourie country, near Sierra Leone, and several European factories had been destroyed and plundered.

There are various causes assigned for the depression in Sierra Leone. I may mention some of these. Stoppage of the slave traffic: A few years ago it was the practice of traders, called Banjuls, from Bathurst, to betake themselves to the riverine towns of the Protectorate, and purchase slaves brought from up-country, and take them back to Bathurst; and the money brought for this purpose was usually spent in Freetown. Again, traders from the Susu country and Futa Yallon used to drive cattle to Freetown, barter them there for trade guns, powder, and Manchester goods, proceed up country—preferably to those parts where slave raiding and tribal wars were going on—purchase the captives taken, and return with them to their own country. All this trade is now stopped, and I do not suppose any right-minded person can regret it when he considers the iniquities of the slave traffic. During my tour last year in the interior I released several parties of slaves consisting of men, women, and children, either shackled with chains or led along tied to one another with halters round their necks. Another cause of the depression has been attributed to the attitude assumed by the domestic slaves, who are not so subservient as formerly to their masters, who find it difficult to get them to gather the produce and send it to the markets. However, I have found that those masters who treat their slaves kindly do not lose them. Hundreds of slaves come every week to Freetown with trade canoes across from Bullom and the adjacent shores, and I have heard no complaints of their deserting their masters. A third cause assigned is the influx of Natives from the interior and the emigration of labourers. It is estimated that 6,000 labourers have proceeded to the Congo since the commencement of the year. This emigration may affect the producing power, but numbers of these labourers return with their wages, which they spend in the Colony; and those who come to Freetown and obtain work there convert their earnings into goods and return with them to their masters. The cessation of the raids and wars which supplied the slave traders, and the entire prohibition of the traffic, must revolutionise the system of trade, and probably accounts for some of the depression that has prevailed, which has been even more felt in French Guinea, as I am informed, than in the Colony of Sierra Leone.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Recent Disturbances in the Native Territories adjacent to Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A Blue-book has just been issued containing the correspondence between Sir S. Rowe, the Governor of Sierra Leone, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies with regard to the recent disturbances in the adjacent native territories. The correspondence commences with a letter dated October 7, 1885, from the Governor, stating that robberies had been frequent in Freetown, committed in many cases, it was alleged, by strangers, who carried away their booty up the river. In order to stop these practices, Sir S. Rowe entered into communications with representatives of the Timmannee States, with the result that certain persons were nominated by the chiefs to assist the local police in the detection of the offenders. Matters in the colony were considerably embarrassed by raids conducted by the turbulent Yonnie tribe upon their neighbours in British territory. In one of the despatches the Governor reported that in view of the critical state of the negotiations with the Yonnies, he had detained H.M.S. Tyne, with the relief of the head-quarters of the 2nd West India Regiment on board; and in the next he reported that the track from Maffuai had been cleared, and he hoped shortly to be able to visit the place. In a despatch dated January 30, he expresses his hope that the display of the electric mast-head light of Her Majesty's ship Racer, together with his words to them, would produce a beneficial result among the marauders. Pacific means, however, for some time seemed likely to fail, until, at a meeting on February 11, the Yonnie chiefs expressed their regret to Major Festing, the Commissioner, and asked pardon. In a despatch of the 9th of April, the Governor reports his reception on the previous day of the Yonnie chiefs, when they had formally expressed their regret for the raid on Songo-town. Considerable difficulty seems to have arisen from the smuggling engaged in by the natives, especially in connexion with the liquor traffic, which resulted in the withholding from one of the chiefs of his stipend until he could give satisfactory explanations. In a despatch dated May 12, Sir Samuel Rowe enclosed the copy of an agreement between the Chiefs of the Yonnie and Quiah clans of Timmannees, and the Bompeh Sherbros, whose quarrel had been the direct cause of the recent raid on Songo Town.\n\nThe Blue-book also contains three maps, in illustration of the correspondence.

Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people. But that retrenchment, on which we feel thus bound to insist, ought never to have touched the School Department or the Native Pastorate. This is indeed beginning at the wrong end.

The necessity of some great development of Sierra Leone mercantile resources has long been evident. The encroachments of the French in the neighbouring rivers greatly hinder that development; and it cannot be thought probable that the aids to Sierra Leone revenue now given by the Sherbro' countries will permanently continue. In Sherbro' everything seems to have been sacrificed to secure a large surplus revenue to augment the income of Sierra Leone. In many admirable communications from Sherbro' we have long since exposed the injustice with which that dependency has been treated. It is a country of great resources, but those resources are crippled by the disadvantages under which merchants and traders have there laboured, owing to the meagre and ill-paid official staff, the want of adequate protection, and the neglect of those improvements for which the duties levied on its trade would provide, and to which it is therefore justly entitled. It is self-evident that in the near future a much larger proportion of the amount annually derived from those duties must be spent in Sherbro'; that the much-needed improvements cannot be longer delayed; that there must be a largely-increased and better-paid staff; more expenditure for sanitary measures and for the supply of adequate public buildings; or that the Sherbro' must have a separate administration, as in the Gambia, when the whole of the revenue levied will have to be expended in the Sherbro' itself. The question of resources of Sierra Leone proper becomes therefore one of yearly increasing importance. With reference to this, we have never ceased to deplore the little attention that has been paid to agriculture, and the seeming absence of all research into the latent wealth of its territory.

Most people walk, but a few are carried about in a hammock swung from a piece of wood which is borne on the shoulders of four sturdy natives, much in the same way as a palanquin is carried in India. The bearers proceed at a rapid pace, with an easy gliding motion which renders this form of locomotion very comfortable and enjoyable in a climate like that of Sierra Leone, where the thermometer rarely goes much below eighty. Although vehicular traffic is absent, there is no lack of life in the streets of Freetown. The main thoroughfares are crowded with people, and there is plenty of animation and bustle. Fat, jolly-looking negresses, with bright coloured Manchester kerchiefs wound picturesquely round their woolly heads, sit at the street corners presiding over baskets of native produce. Native dandies, attired in what they probably consider the height of fashion, lounge about the principal shops, eyeing the passers-by. There is a cheerful air about all, and every one appears to take life easily.

One long street is full of shops devoted to the sale of Manchester prints and Birmingham hardware. Amongst the latter I noticed a number of flimsy-looking rifles, which, I imagine, would do more injury to the persons who fired them than to those they were fired at, and a quantity of cheap swords, equally effective in appearance.

I had heard and read so much of its unhealthiness that I had pictured to myself a low-lying swampy coast, fringed with mangrove bushes, and with the other accompaniments of a malarial climate. This imaginary sketch bore not the slightest resemblance to the truth. In the place of a flat, low-lying district I found a mountainous tract of country, formed by two rivers which nearly intersect it. The general appearance of this Sierra is picturesque in the extreme. The sky line is broken by the irregular outline of a number of conical peaks, covered to their summits with lofty forests, which give to the distant scenery a rich and romantic appearance. Freetown is situated on the shore of a beautiful bay, hemmed in by a grand amphitheatre of hills, covered with vegetation.

A fairer situation for a town can scarcely be imagined, and if the sad experience of the past did not teach us the contrary, it would be pronounced healthy. There is no room to doubt, however, that Sierra Leone is extremely unhealthy, and epidemics of fever occur from time to time which sweep off large numbers of the population. This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels', 'content': ""The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly.

They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

Larger states could raid smaller ones, but all of them raided the neighbouring noncentralized communities, who suffered the most. The exception of Rwanda and Burundi (already mentioned) shows that it was possible to form an alternative strategy in dealing with this penetration of trade. Their strength came not from acquisition of guns but from their ability to maintain stability and unity in the densely populated mountain environment. Their extensive wars and raids during the period enabled them to accumulate wealth in a situation in which ivory and captives were irrelevant.\nThe second region we have deliberately omitted in this section is southern Tanzania.

The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others.

Secondly, according to the terms of their 'apprenticeship', they were to be remunerated in animals and other such valuables.$^{25}$ In this way many of them acquired personal property that they were allowed to take back to their countries.\nThe presence of Sotho and Tswana in the Cape Colony did not, however, solve the other pressing want of the Colony.

Tension, open conflict on the border, cattle-lifting, retaliatory commando raids all continued.\nThis picture of black-white relationships in the Colony, however, must be qualified lest the reader is left with the impression that no areas of peaceful intercourse existed. There was, in spite of disputes and fights over grazing and hunting rights, a desire by both black and white for the promotion of commercial relations, because each of the groups had access to certain things that the other did not have. For example, the Xhosa had ivory, horns, hides, beef and gum for which there was a high demand from the colonial traders. The Xhosa needed copper, beads, buttons, guns, gunpowder and spiritous liquors, especially brandy, which only the colonial traders could supply. Thus, in spite of the hostilities between the Africans and the colonists, a system of barter existed. No form of control, military or legislative, could stop this. In fact, ever since the meeting of black and white on the Eastern Frontier, commercial intercourse had continued between them, and in defiance of government policy.

The rivalry for control of trade increased the social disruption and this was further intensified by population move› ments caused by the contemporaneous Nguni (also referred to as Ngoni in some of the literature) invasion. The consequent instability increased the number of people who were ready to follow enterprising leaders. In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another. In the 1860s the Arabs managed to have Mnwa Sele deposed and replaced by Mkasiwa, and Mnwa Sele's brother Simba left Unyanyembe to set up his kingdom among the Konongo to the south-west of Tabora. Another member of the chiefly family in Unyan› yembe called Nyungu ya Ma we left his country in 1874 to establish a well-organized kingdom among the Wakimbu to the south-west of the Wanyamwezi. Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state. Even Isike, the successor of Mkasiwa in Unyanyembe, became powerful enough to offer the Arabs and later the Germans a great deal of resistance."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The impact of the Mfecane on the Cape Colony', 'section_title': 'The Cape Colony on the eve of the Mfecane', 'content': ""On the whole, the relationships between the various Nguni-speaking peoples were relatively peaceful.

First, it must be borne in mind that for centuries Ngunispeaking communities had been slowly moving south-westwards from the Natal area. On the other hand white expansion in the opposite direction had been taking place since 1652, when Jan van Riebeeck founded a Dutch settlement at the Cape. The two movements were bound to clash somewhere. They clashed in what South African historiography used to refer to as 'Kaffir Wars'.\nSecondly, the Fish river, although recognized by the Cape government as the boundary, was often violated by the people whom it was meant to separate and keep apart. The colonists, especially cattle-farmers, violated it in search of grazing. The Africans, on the other hand, had never had any intention of recognizing, let alone respecting, this boundary, because when it was proclaimed by the Cape government many Xhosa communities had long been established along the Fish river and to the west of it. The frontier zone was regarded by many Xhosa as part of their ancestral lands of which they had been deprived by the ever-expanding Colony. For this reason, therefore, many Xhosa continued to graze and water their herds across the Fish and in defiance of the Cape government.

These developments made it impossible for Cape Nguni to expand north-eastwards.\nBecause they formed the vanguard of the Cape Nguni's westward and southward expansion, the Xhosa automatically bore the brunt of blackwhite conflict on the border. As a result the Xhosa have not only been by far the most written about, they have also been the most abused and the most hated of the Cape Nguni peoples of the region in Cape colonial historiography. 9\nAs already said, the Xhosa, who did not recognize the Fish as a boundary, simply crossed it at will to graze their cattle and sheep. Such boundary 'violations' were sometimes accompanied by cattle-rustling, to which the Cape colonists often responded with organized retaliatory raids into Xhosa areas, arguing that such action was necessary for them to retrieve their property. It was not unusual, however, for the activities of the colonial commandos to exceed the stated objectives.\nIt is clear, therefore, that black-white relationships in the region were not peaceful on the eve of the Mfecane.

Then I looked out for a conflagration in the direction where the sparks came from (north-east), and at last I saw that I had tumbled on the very thing I had read of, a shower of flying stars, and called out my people to witness it. It was a beautiful and interesting sight, thousands of flying stars flying through the clear sky, all in the same direction, N.E. to S.W., horizontally, not very high over the earth. Their visible course varied from ten to forty degrees of length; the former only resembling a slight stroke of a match in a dark room, the latter partly attaining a great brightness, far exceeding that of Venus, and gradually dying away, but without any sound.

It appears that during the march of the Ashantees and Elminas through the Dutch territory, when a great many Fantees were massacred by them in cold blood, even within the precincts of the Dutch forts, some Moree people (Moree is a little seaside place about four miles from Cape Coast) were caught and killed. To avenge this the Moreens attacked an Elmina fishing canoe on the high seas. There were three men in the canoe, of whom two were killed and the third was brought in and delivered to the British authorities. The chief have pleaded a justification in what has been thus done. The case is being heard by Mr. Chief Magistrate Chalmers as Judicial Assessor. The justification which the Moreens plead is that they were first pursued by the Elminas on the high seas; that seven of their people, their King's own brother being one, who had for some time been peaceable residents in Elmina and its districts, were murdered in cold blood, and the Dutch authorities did nothing to prevent it; and that above seventy Fantees had been murdered by the Elminas.

Who have for the last ten years consumed what has been imported into the country, but the protected tribes? And within that period, when there has been nothing of Ashanti trade to speak of, the revenue is nearly ten times what it was during the best days of Ashanti trade; and the trade is now healthier. Thus much for the vaunted Ashanti trade. It is true there is not so much gold dust shipped to England now-a-days from this quarter as there used to be; but you have not the wear and tear that comes from haggling with the Ashantees when they come to trade with you direct, and your profits are larger.\n\nIf trade is what you care so very much for, open up the interior, and you will regret that you had not sufficient nous to have perceived what benefits would have accrued to you had you done this somewhat earlier. But why, we ask, should the Ashantees be permitted to pass through our territory, and come down to the coast to trade, and have the same opportunities and privilege of buying and selling in the same market with us, when they will not permit us to pass through their territory and advance into the interior, and bring ourselves into contact with the tribes there? Why should not the Ashantees permit the tribes and races inland to proceed through their territory and approach the coast? Why should Coomassie be the barrier beyond which no Fantee, nor any of the tribes from the coast, can advance into the interior; and the confines of Ashanti proper be the boundary line for all tribes inland? Why not compel his Majesty of Ashanti to permit his vast dominions, and the country inland, to be open and common to all, in like manner as ours is to his people? In former days—that is, before this treaty of '31—no Ashantee was permitted to advance beyond Mansue to trade, and the merchants found the trade more profitable, and the country was then more prosperous. There is no necessity to take millions from British tax-payers to re-establish and protect us; but there is a necessity of a most urgent kind to recover your lost prestige; to punish a savage and ruthless monarch, who, without any cause for provocation, has invaded and overrun the finest parts of a territory you profess to protect and govern; to make some sacrifice and some return for the millions of people you yourselves have taken from our country and sold into slavery; to open up a vast and unexplored country to the influences of civilization and Christianity, and, over and above all, to fulfil your high destiny—a destiny that impels you to extend your empire, much as you may loathe to do so.""}, {'id': 2644, 'article_title': 'SUPPLIES OF POWDER, LEAD, &c., TO THE ASHANTEES.', 'full_section_title': 'SUPPLIES OF POWDER, LEAD, &c., TO THE ASHANTEES.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1873#article-19', 'issue_date': '31_12_1873', 'content': 'The Standard lately published the following from ""An Accra Correspondent:""—""It would be useless now to inquire why the ports of Quittah and Jellah Coffee, in the district of Akwoolah, have been and are still left open to the enemy, where he may furnish himself with warlike supplies.

It is the old story over again—the offshoot of a bad example; and it is the old historic adaptation of Bombastes Furioso rehearsed to the roll of the monotonous tomtom, and to the melancholy drone of the cow's horn. I am quite sensible that the Fantees, unaided, are at any time a match for the martial swagger of Ashantee; but I do not think that a ceaseless resort to threats of blood-letting, by whichever side it may be tried, adds to the growth of trade or points to that moral day when the diffusion of Christian arts shall come to Africa with the warmth and brilliancy of an ordinary sunrise in summer.\n\nIt thus allude grossly, as it were, to trade because by the instincts of trade alone can the settlements on the Gold Coast be redeemed from the political and social darkness in which they are plunged. If the King of Ashantee would but turn—or could by frequent argument but be made to turn—his thoughts to trade instead of to the concocting of foolish war-letters, what blessings would he not confer on Ashantee; and were the Ashantees a people more thoroughly commercial than they are, what exercise of wit could hinder them from absorbing and monopolising the whole trade from the Coast to the interior? They might become the brokers between the traders on the Coast and the tribes lying to the back of Ashantee, for the commodities which they bought would be re-bought with avidity. But, because untaught, they have no notion of purchasing European articles in large quantities. They buy enough to satisfy their own immediate wants, and perhaps they retain an insignificant residue to barter for wares which they cannot get from the merchants on the Coast, but which abound in the markets inland."", 'last_edit_date': '1868-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1868#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some of the Difficulties in the Way of Extending Trade in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The boundary question on the west of the colony, about which a Commission was employed some eighteen months ago, should at once be settled, and the smuggling across the frontier put an end to.

The trade of the Ashantees before we acquired their possessions from the Dutch had always been with that nation, and the Fantees had always traded with us. This system had caused many disputes and jealousies between the two races, and there can be little doubt that the Fantees do their best to force all trade between the Ashantees and the coast to pass through their hands, and that the true cause of our difficulties with Ashanti has been this action of the Fantees.

At the beginning of the last century the Ashantees, who are supposed to have come from the interior and to have been compelled to move southward by a pressure from thence, attacked and subdued some of the more powerful of the tribes who now form the northern part of the Protectorate. Moving steadily onwards, about 1760 they had extended their conquests so far south as to excite some apprehension in the minds of the European settlers on the coast; and in 1800 had forcibly subdued the whole country from the seaboard of the Assinee River on the west, to the mouth of the Volta on the east, excepting only a small crescent embracing the Fantees, and a few other small tribes situated immediately in rear of the settlements.\n\nEmboldened by the success which had hitherto attended their progress, and encouraged no doubt by the hope of acquiring, or at least sharing the benefits which they soon found resulted from a closer contact with Europeans, the Ashantees, at the commencement of the present century, attacked the Fantees and the remaining unconquered tribes whom the settlers, with a selfish but mistaken regard for their own interest, left to their fate.\n\nIn 1807 the Ashantees were masters of the whole country, and had even attacked and taken one of the European settlements. With the British they came once into collision, but were repulsed, and their further aggressions were averted by an engagement on the part of the authorities not to assist the Fantees. During the next few years so bitter was the yoke imposed on the conquered nations, that several of them combined and revolted against it, but without success; the Ashantees not only maintained their hold over the country, but even threatened Cape Coast, whose safety was only purchased by discreditable concessions. This state of things lasted until 1817, the unhappy Fantees continuing to suffer the greatest oppression at the hands of their conquerors, when it was thought by the authorities at Cape Coast advisable to attempt to negotiate with the Ashantees, with the view of establishing peace on a secure footing, and promoting the prosecution of lawful trade. The mission which was sent was much struck, in passing through Assin and Fantee, with the traces of desolation which the Ashantees had everywhere left behind: ""Not a vestige of cultivation was to be seen, and heaps of ruined villages appeared on every side, round which the miserable natives stalked with the gaunt and sullen aspect of famine and despair.""', 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain and Ashanti in the Past', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The recall of Sir Francis Scott, Chief of the Gold Coast  \nConstabulary, has once more directed attention to the relations  \nexisting between Great Britain and Ashanti.

Tekeman is the root of Fantees and Gyawomans. After the departure of the two portions, Fantes and the Gyawomans, the few remains of Tekeman grew up into a good-sized State and became wealthy; forming in a position a neighbouring tribe of the Inkuransah State. When the Ashantees had gained the power from the Denkerahs, Tekeman attracted their attention very much. Tekeman had accumulated so much riches that a sister of its King, Ammiyow, Djuamanwah by name, expressed a desire to know what poverty was. The avarice of Ashantees grew so high that their King, Opokoowaree, the second on the stool, engaged Baffoo, the King of his allied State, Inkuransah, to contrive a scheme to subjugate Tekeman. Baffoo was known to be full of schemes, and his name is preserved in Ashanti with the reputation that none can beat him in cunning. Baffoo like, his first step, after bargaining with Opokoowaree as to what should be his portion of the booty when he had succeeded, was to seek an intimacy with Ammiyow. This he gained. Seeing that he had fully secured the confidence of Ammiyow, he hinted to him that there was a preparation of war against him in Kumasi, in ambiguous phrase, which moved Ammiyow to inquire what it meant. Baffoo, who knew what he was about, gave Ammiyow the literal meaning of the phrase, and desired him to act in like manner, and that was to bury all the muskets he had in the State just at the outskirt of his capital, or on the way by which the enemies were to enter, and on their approach to these muskets, his crying out ""Muskets arise!"" would be a sufficient charm to kill every one of them. Ammiyow did as he was advised by his friend. Baffoo then acquainted Opokoowaree with his success, and desired an army to be sent to plunder the country. On their approach, Ammiyow and people, inspired with vain confidence, vehemently cried to the dumb muskets; there was, however, no sign of enemies being killed, but of their being rather invigorated to butcher them.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.746, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Thus as early as the 1860s, at a time when the French and British governments were generally opposed to colonial acquisitions in Africa, the special circumstances of this particular African locality had already involved the two most active European nations in a struggle for territorial possession.

The French and British declarations of protectorates in the area between 1862 and 1863 did not enjoy official ratification and had to be abandoned in the 1870s. But the struggle was resumed again in the 1880s, partly because of the entry of Germany into the race and partly because of renewed invasions by Dahomey which increased the determination of the rulers of Porto Novo and the states of western Yorubaland to seek protection from the French or the British. The French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, the AngloFrench Partition of Borgu in 1895, the extension of British rule over the rest of Yorubaland and their conquest of Benin in 1897 must be seen as the logical conclusion of the Anglo-French rivalry of the 1860s, itself provoked by the pre-existing unities of the hinterland of the ports the European powers tried to control on the coast.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system. These various strategies and measures proved on the whole unsuccessful, and by the end of the period under review, colonialism had become firmly entrenched in the whole of West Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

This French Protectorate of Porto Novo, together with the solicitations to Bonny to enter into a treaty, looks like a continuance of that policy of twenty years ago in the Sierra Leone rivers, at Assinee and Grand Bassam, which we exposed at the time, although our warnings were not heeded by the authorities representing Her Majesty\'s Government in West Africa.'}, {'id': 4689, 'article_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'full_section_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_10_1883', 'content': 'The onward march of time and the contingency of circumstances, which are constantly altering the position of men and things with reference the one to the other, work similar changes with regard to the relative positions and reciprocal duties of a mother country and her dependencies. Colonies up to a certain period of their political existence, and mere settlements always, are regarded by the Mother Country as without title to any will of their own, and as existing solely for her pleasure and profit, convenience or reputation. The most vital interests of a settlement, as in the case of Lagos and Porto Novo, may demand as indispensable the annexation of an adjoining territory, in obtaining which none but easily overcome objections or difficulties could be met with, while the Mother Country, not seeing any advantage to itself by the desired measure, or having any more than ordinary official solicitude for the well-being of the settlement, turns a deaf ear to all the solicitations of its over-sea subjects, leaving the coveted prize to be carried off by some other European Power, to the discomfort, detriment, and danger of the people who were alive to their wants and interests, present and prospective, but who were without power to do anything of themselves toward the attainment of the reasonable object of their desires. We have felt very deeply for Lagos in this matter of the lately-assumed protectorate of Porto Novo by France—a measure which, as we have before pointed out, can bring neither honour nor profit to France herself, while it has been about as unfriendly an act as she could possibly have committed. Our only excuse for the French Government is in what we believe to be the fact, that it has been grossly deceived by interested commercial men actuated by very paltry considerations. The character of the individual, King Tofa, and his rule at Porto Novo, are set forth in a short paragraph which will be found in another column; and it is not unworthy of notice that one of the early results under the French Protectorate was a course of exceedingly arbitrary conduct towards the German agents of some German merchants at Lagos, who, we suppose, have become formidable competitors to the French merchants, who for a long time nearly monopolized the supply of Hamburgh potato spirit gin to the traders in that settlement. We do not suppose that any expression of opinion by us will have any particular weight with the Colonial Office, but we cannot refrain from stating our opinion, or rather conviction, that by obtaining from the French Government an abandonment of its so hastily-assumed protectorate of Porto Novo, Lord Granville (who would no doubt act if moved to do so by the Colonial Office) would be doing as great a service to France as to Lagos.'}, {'id': 4724, 'article_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-20', 'issue_date': '01_11_1883', 'content': 'If the old ""Quem vult perdere,"" which applied equally to nations as to individuals, had not been so hackneyed, we should undoubtedly have chosen it as a fitting introduction to what we feel bound to write as regards the late, and present external action of the French Government, which seems to us to have placed France upon the slippery plank at the bottom of which lies disaster, if not ruin. It would be impossible, we think, for even the most unreasoning admirer of France, its people, and its Government, to find cause for eulogy in the late external action of the Paris cabinet. With Annam and Tonquin we have nothing to do, though we may have formed our opinions on the subject. As regards Madagascar, we consider the French action, prompted by the Réunion planters, as so certain to lead, if successful, to a new revival of the African slave trade, either open or under the pretence of apprenticeship, or free labour contracts, that, as such, and as a wanton aggression on a community of the African race that has been for some time steadily progressing on the road to civilization, we do not hesitate to give it our most emphatic condemnation. The Government of Liberia, like that of Madagascar, refuses to allow white men to obtain a settlement on any portion of its land by purchase; and although this has greatly interfered with the development of the resources of the country, by shutting out European capital and energy, we can find quite enough in the history of past relations of Europeans with the people of Africa to excuse this policy of isolation. Behind every European acquiring, by purchase, landed possessions in such a country, there looms the national government of that European in the distance, as almost certain to become a factor in any dispute that might arise between him and the authorities. With equal justice, therefore, might France make demands upon Liberia, as upon Madagascar, on the ground of refusal to allow French subjects to become freeholders. What most concerns us, however, as regards the present external action of the French Government, is that portion of it which embraces west and south-west Africa in its disturbing course. We have before alluded to and condemned (and it will bear repetition) the most unfriendly action of France in taking the wretched King Tofa, of Porto Novo, under its protection. We repeat, situate as Porto Novo is with regard to Lagos, together with the non-existence of any real French interest there, the acceptance of a Protectorate by France was about as offensively unfriendly an action as can well be conceived. The French mercantile house that counselled it, has performed about as questionable service to France as was performed by the Portuguese slave trader who led the French Government into a similar measure some twenty years ago. No good can come of it to France, and much evil may. We and all other advocates of the rights of humanity, must now hold her responsible for all the horrors it may please her atrocious protege, King Tofa, to commit. We have a right to demand, in the interests of humanity and civilization, that the French Protectorate of Porto Novo shall be characterized and justified by the absolute repression of those fearful customs in which it has pleased King Tofa and his predecessors to indulge. Such repression has characterized the action of Great Britain in West Africa, and the way in which she has thus exercised her power for freeing the poor wretched victims of tyranny and superstition constitute, in our mind, her only just claim to rule there. Her keeping peace among the natives, and suppressing all slavery and slave trade, so far as within her power; affording protection to trade and commerce, and laying the foundation of civilization on which the natives may hereafter build—these, we say, and to afford protection for philanthropic and missionary enterprise, are her raison d\'etre, on the West Coast. There is no doubt—there can be no doubt—that she might do this work better than she does, if more enlightened councils prevailed in Downing Street; still, what she has done, has been greatly instrumental for good. To feel this fully we have only to imagine what the West Coast of Africa would have been without persistent British interference and guardianship there. And it must always be borne in mind that the imperial exchequer does not receive one farthing from her settlements and possessions, and the protected trade there; while under her liberal free trade system, the ships, subjects, and goods of every other civilized power, European or American, have the same advantages as her own. In a word, she keeps the greater portion of West Africa open to trade and commerce for the benefit of the whole world. Now, the French Colonial system is the very reverse of this. Her protective and prohibitive regulations are in full force at Goree and Senegal; and, by intelligence lately received, we can have no doubt that France is anxious to confer similar benefits on other portions of the West Coast. The French admiral who took Porto Novo under French protection, looked in upon other places on his way down the coast. He made overtures to the King of Bonny, which the king and chief, who have received education in England, were too wise to listen to. And now we learn further that he has proposed to establish a French factory at Old Calabar, and that King Duke Ephraim IX., whose coronation under the auspices of the British consul and the Rev. W. Anderson, we some time since gave an account of, has held a grand council and petitioned the French Government to induce French traders to settle there. Those who do not know anything of the West Coast would suppose from this that French traders were hitherto denied trade with Old Calabar; which, under British consular auspices, has been open for trade to all the world from the period at which Great Britain put a final end to the slave trade there. The intended process is clear. A French factory under Government auspices, perhaps managed by Messrs.

A quarter of a million sterling, he said, was to be expended in improving Kotono, the harbour of Porto Novo. He is also said to have represented to the native chiefs the advantages of French rule over English. Two lines of steamers have been subsidised by the French Government to call at Kotono.\n\nThe _Journal des Débats_, referring to the above telegram, states that Baron Beeckman, the French Resident at Porto Novo, has ceased to represent France at that place for the last two months, having been replaced by M. Tantin, the Administrator of Senegal, and declares that no new difficulty has arisen between France and England in connexion with the delimitation of their respective territories on the Gulf of Benin. On the contrary, the question now pending was in reality in a fair way of settlement, and the conclusion of a convention was imminent. The journal adds that there is a question of improving Port Kotono by the establishment of a wharf, but the work is being undertaken by a private firm without any financial co-operation from the French administration. In conclusion the journal states that Dr. Bayol, Governor of the South Rivers, will shortly go on a mission to the coast in order to arrange with the native Sovereigns of Dahomey and Porto Novo questions of a complicated nature to which the French protectorate over those portions of the coast has given rise.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-07-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_08_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In West Africa. Since our last, as our readers will perceive, the French have established themselves at Black Point, and in other territory in the neighbourhood of the River Congo; they have resumed a Protectorate over Porto Novo in the neighbourhood of Lagos; they have ""called in"" at Bonny and proposed to enter into treaties (as a preliminary no doubt to a protectorate) with our friend King Peppel. We ask again, What does all this mean? With the Madagascar and Tonquin business on their hands, why this display of small energy on the West Coast of Africa? Can it be that the appetite for the River Gambia has of late increased in strength, and that it is wished to have as many insignificant points as possible to yield in exchange for that magnificent possession, for a most valuable ore it would undoubtedly be in the hands of those who already possess the ""Senegal,"" and are at present the great purchasers of its chief produce—""ground nuts""—from which the oil is expressed at Marseilles, where it becomes ""fine Lucca,"" ""best Olive""? But why, we shall be asked, why do you, you who have been calling incessantly upon your own Government to annex the sea-coast from Quittah to Whydah, and to take possession of Porto Novo, and to assume some sort of governing power over the Oil Rivers, why do you complain of French aggression and occupation? In the first place, the circumstances and conditions of Great Britain and France are essentially different; and, in the second, Great Britain differs in its occupations and annexations of foreign barbarous countries, from all other civilized powers. Since the erring and disastrous attempt to tax the people of her then North American colonies, for the benefit of the mother country, Great Britain has never sought to derive revenue for the Imperial exchequer from any of her beyond sea possessions. Until she adopted and put into universal practice in her colonies and possessions (such as had not legislatures of their own) of the principles of free trade, every acquisition of territory in West Africa, or Fiji, or New Guinea, or elsewhere, is an occupation by her for the benefit and advantage of the manufacturers and commercial people of every other state and power. She holds and administers for the general benefit of the people whom she and her subjects are seeking to civilize, and of the world at large. Not from any one of her Colonies or possessions does she draw one farthing of revenue into and for the benefit of the Imperial exchequer. But France, if she takes possession of territory, establishes therein her exclusive system. She takes possession for the benefit of French manufacturing industry, and shipping, and commerce, to the exclusion of all other. Let her open the ports of her Colonies and possessions to the British flag and to British commerce, as Great Britain opens hers to the French flag and to French commerce, and no one would hail with more pleasure than we should do her ""occupation,"" however extensive, of the uncivilized portions of the habitable world. But even then she should do what is worthy of a great nation, and not make little, unworthy, pettifogging attacks upon the tranquillity of semi-civilized people. We had intended in this number of our journal to have entered at large upon this subject, in consequence of her recent action at Black Point, Porto Novo, and Bonny. But ""the unexpected,"" which so often frustrates the carrying out of human intentions, prevents our doing so; and we are compelled to content ourselves with blaming anew the British Government for its culpable indifference to the welfare of Lagos, in turning a deaf ear to all the entreaties of which the friends of Lagos have been prodigal, that possession should be taken of Porto Novo, and the barbarous cruelties of its abominable rulers be put an end to by the enforcement of British Law. We feel this very much. We were partly influential in obtaining the occupation and annexation of Lagos; and we always urged that its Government should be made to embrace Porto Novo. We were opposed in this by the old influence that made of Whydah a depôt for free African labourers for the French plantations, as a substitute for the suppressed African Slave Trade. We had hoped that influence had abandoned the Lagos Waters, and was now operating only on the East of Africa and in Madagascar.

From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia. The Governor has investigated the circumstances attending the hauling-down of the Union Jack at two stations in the interior.

Here once more we find all the ""hinterland"" of Dahomey to the west and north secured to France. The Say-Barroua line marking the limits of French influence, according to the Anglo-French agreements, extends perpendicularly to the eastern frontier of Dahomey.\n\nSuch is the position of the French in West and Northern Central Africa, and a glance at a map of the district clearly shows that with a degree of slothfulness utterly inexplicable we have allowed France to step in behind most of our colonies and secure the rich ""Hinterlands"" in the rear. Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast are now completely isolated, small red spots in a great sea of French territory. It may and will be argued that the French lay claim to these enormous tracts of land in a purely nominal way, that they are not likely to interfere with our trade in these regions, and that if it pleases them to colour them French on their maps, why it is a harmless amusement, which cannot possibly affect us in any way. Unfortunately, we find upon examining the question that these arguments do not hold good. In the first place, the French, unfortunately, do not lay claim to these regions in a purely nominal way; it would seem, on the contrary, that they are secured to them by virtue of regular treaties with ourselves and with the native chiefs, if not with our approval, at least with our tacit consent. Secondly, as to their not interfering with our trade: certainly, they have not done so far to any great extent, but everything tends to show that they are beginning to do so in good earnest. The events which are taking place behind Sierra Leone are ample proof of this. French outposts are slowly advancing along our frontier line, and we are continually learning from the local papers of caravans on their way to Freetown being turned aside and obliged to take the roads leading to the French Coast Settlements.

The French were establishing factories there, and distributing flags among the natives, which was evidently a ruse to get the country. The residents of El Obey were trying to prevent the encroachments of the French upon Spanish territory. It was the general opinion that should the French obtain supremacy in El Obey, it would end in driving away the present traders, as the feeling was anything but amicable. As yet the true line of French and Spanish territory seemed to be but an imaginary one, but this would doubtless be disputed. The French had tried to establish a factory at Old Calabar, and had had an interview with King Duke Ephraim IX., who had held a grand Council, when it was resolved to petition the French Government to induce French traders to settle there, the natives being in favour of the same.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain and France on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is rumoured that negotiations are being carried on in Paris between the Governments of Great Britain and France which may have a very serious result for the British colony of Sierra Leone. The question under discussion is one of those curious points which sometimes arise in treaties relating to countries of which maps can give only an approximately correct idea. For the past twenty-five years France has been gradually closing in upon Sierra Leone, whose sole trade is in the various products which reach the coast from the interior. This trade is now a valuable one, the exports amounting to something like £400,000 a year, and the imports, mostly from England, to a similar sum. In August 1889, a convention was come to between the two countries as to the spheres of influence in the ""Hinterland,"" and it was agreed that the boundaries of Sierra Leone should not extend beyond 11:40 of longitude West of Greenwich and 10 degrees of latitude. Near the borderline was the important native town of Fararma, situated almost at the source of the River Niger. It is here that the native caravans on their way to Sierra Leone from the interior have to cross the river, and it is consequently a place of great commercial importance. On the French maps Fararma is shown well within the French boundary; but accurate observation demonstrates that it is really within the British limits, and the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are anxious to retain this important entrepôt of trade in their own hands. It is the neck of the bottle through which the trade of the colony flows, and this is recognised by the French no less than by the English colonists. France is therefore doing her utmost to obtain such a modification of the Convention above referred to as will give her control over this trade centre. The bait held out to our Government is some concession in that no-man\'s-land, the region around Lake Chad. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are alarmed at the danger which threatens their trade, and have pointed out to Lord Salisbury and Lord Knutsford that Sierra Leone is of great strategical importance to the Empire, and that the cession of Fararma to France, by enabling the French to deflect the trade to their Senegal and Niger colonies, must result in the destruction of the commerce of Sierra Leone and in its eventually being absorbed into the French colonies, by which it is even now almost entirely hemmed in.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Two important reports have just been issued dealing with two of our somewhat neglected colonies on the West Coast of Africa, colonies which, now that international competition is so intense, should be kept hold of with a firm hand.

As it is, a work of great importance has just been concluded in the interests of England. The encroachments of the French on our West African sphere are well known to those who have been watching events in that part of the world. Their evident aim was so to surround our four little colonies as to shut them out completely from the interior, and ruin them so far as their trade goes. Fortunately, H.E. Alfred Moloney, Governor of Lagos, saw clearly what the policy of the French was, and from his knowledge of the country and people was able to take steps to preserve for Lagos a free route to the interior and the commerce of the native markets, and to bring a large and valuable country within the sphere of British influence. Practically the whole of the fine Yoruba country has been attached and free access obtained to and beyond the Kong Mountains, and to the sphere of the Royal Niger Company. Governor Moloney deserves to be congratulated on having accomplished this delicate task.\n\nHis report on Lagos for 1888, just issued, is voluminous and abounds in information as to the condition of the colony. He begins with a useful comparative statement of the tariffs of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gold Coast, Lagos, the intervening French and German possessions, and the Royal Niger Territory. Lagos was acquired by treaty in 1861, and the report embodies figures showing its growth since. The revenue for 1887 came to £51,347, while the expenditure reached...\n163\n\n£78,610.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

The configuration of the basins of the rivers Niger and Binué as they float to the sea may be represented by the letter Y, of which the tail stands on the Atlantic coast. The distance from the confluence of the rivers to the coast is about 300 miles. The district is traversed from west to east by rising ground from which other rivers running parallel with the main flood of the Lower Niger flow also to the sea. These minor rivers are known under the general name of the Oil Rivers. Their mouths constitute coast ports where African trade has for a very long period been carried on. The names of the seven principal Oil Rivers are Benin, Brass, New Calabar, Bonny, Quaebo, Opobo, and Old Calabar. The coast district through which they flow to the sea spreads east and west of the mouth of the Lower Niger, and forms one British dependency known as the Niger Coast Protectorate. It stretches from the frontier of Lagos to the Rio del Rey, which is the frontier of the German Cameroons. The mouths of the Niger and the territory lying round and enclosed by the rivers Niger and Binué up to the limits of the British *Hinterland* in the interior, constitute the sphere of influence of the Royal Niger Company, which for purposes of convenience may be spoken of as ""Nigeria."" Thus we get in this portion of British West Africa three separate British dependencies—the colony of Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate filling up the space between the French and German frontiers upon the seaboard, with the Royal Niger Company\'s territory of Nigeria spreading Y-shaped into the interior and possessing on the coast only the narrow riverain strip by which it commands access to the sea. The colonies of Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate cover together about 3,000 square miles. Nigeria has an extent of about 500,000 square miles. For the administration of affairs upon the coast the Imperial Government is directly responsible. The administration of affairs in the interior is carried on under the charter granted about ten years ago to the Royal Niger Company.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1897#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

The French and British declarations of protectorates in the area between 1862 and 1863 did not enjoy official ratification and had to be abandoned in the 1870s.

However, as will be seen below, far more of the rulers opted for the strategy of militant confrontation than those of submission and alliance while opposition here was far more protracted than anywhere else in West Africa for two main reasons. The first, as pointed out already, was that the French used the method of military conquest almost exclusively, which consequently evoked militant reaction.

European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men.

But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

That this step will prove the salvation of Lagos, in a commercial point of view, there can be no doubt. Porto Novo having been allowed to slip from our grasp into the hands of the French, had already caused immense damage to the trade of this place, and the extent of that injury would have been increased a hundredfold, had the French been allowed to add Okeodan and Addo to their possessions. Merchants here did not fail speedily to appreciate the value of the acquisition made by this Government; and if those at home interested in the welfare of Lagos will glance at the map, and reflect for a moment on the state of our relations with Porto Novo and Abeokuta, they cannot fail at once to perceive the great danger that we have escaped by securing to ourselves the possession of Okeodan and Addo, together with the river of the latter name, instead of allowing the French to occupy them.

If the annexation of these places could be of any value to the French, their possession is doubtless of equal importance to us; in fact, I may say of very much greater importance to us.

This French Protectorate of Porto Novo, together with the solicitations to Bonny to enter into a treaty, looks like a continuance of that policy of twenty years ago in the Sierra Leone rivers, at Assinee and Grand Bassam, which we exposed at the time, although our warnings were not heeded by the authorities representing Her Majesty\'s Government in West Africa.'}, {'id': 4671, 'article_title': 'The French Protectorate of Porto Novo', 'full_section_title': 'The French Protectorate of Porto Novo', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1883#article-10', 'issue_date': '01_08_1883', 'content': 'We are not at all surprised to find that the local Lagos press complains bitterly of the French protectorate of Porto Novo. Lagos and Porto Novo, as one of the editors writes, are naturally, from their relative positions, parts of a single State; neither of them is, or can ever be, from physical, economical, and social reasons, complete without the other. This has been long since urged upon the British Government. Sir John Glover, when Governor of Lagos, was deeply penetrated by this truth, and, if our memory serves us aright, made strong representations to Downing Street of the absolute necessity (if Lagos was to fulfil the hopes entertained of her, and realize the objects in view when she was annexed) of the barbarous rule at Porto Novo being put an end to, by the pensioning off of its bloodthirsty ruler, and uniting it with Lagos. Nothing could seem to be more hopeless than any progress of civilization in Porto Novo while it should remain under native rule. King Tofa, the present ruler, has followed in the way of his predecessors, slaughtering no small number of human victims. It will, perhaps, be said that if this be the case, we ought to welcome the French protectorate there. This we cannot do, for at least two good reasons. First, that the place must, ere long, have been united with Lagos; and, secondly, that we do not believe the declaration of a French protectorate will exercise any beneficial influence. As from its position with regard to Lagos, and the channels of access to it from the sea, France cannot possibly turn the protectorate to any profitable account, we do not believe that she will, in any way, interfere with King Tofa\'s humane government. In the course of the correspondence which has appeared in the London papers about the New Hebrides, &c., we found it gravely stated that the French Government certainly would not do such a thing, because ""it would be an unfriendly act."" Now, a more unfriendly act than this declaration of a protectorate over Porto Novo we could scarcely conceive. France had no interests there, commercial or other, to protect, and the only safe approach to Porto Novo for merchandise is from within the Bar of Lagos, which is British. Cargo can occasionally be landed on the sea beach, from which it has then to be transported by hand to the town, but as the sea breaks heavily on that beach outside Lagos Bar, the operation is a risky one. So fully was this peculiar circumstance of situation and approach admitted, that with the first news of the declaration of a protectorate came also the rumour that the French Government would make a canal from the sea beach to the town—about as absurd an idea as could possibly be conceived; and although some strange projects seem to have got of late into French administrative minds, such a one as this is at least beyond the bounds of probability. However reputedly rich France may be, yet, with a population that has ceased to increase, with a revenue that for the present has ceased to be elastic, and with a very high and yearly increasing ordinary annual expenditure, she is not likely to throw away some millions in so unfruitful an enterprise as the attempt to cut such a canal would be. We cannot help, therefore, expressing anew our unfeigned regret that the French Government should have authorized or approved of such a measure as the assuming a protectorate over Porto Novo, which cannot bring to her anything but loss of honour, or expense without equivalent benefit. In its cry of distress The Lagos Times makes a remark which has just now, and will continue to have, a much wider application than to this matter of which it treats. The Editor says: ""Little as England, on her own account, cares for such an acquisition [as Porto Novo], she should not so much have disregarded our interest in the matter, which is real, while it would be difficult to ascertain the extent of French interest in it; without driving out the Germans, which she would scarcely venture to do, or imposing unjust restrictions on their trade, her own trade [that of France] cannot be improved by the step."" We have long foreseen that this diversity of interests between Great Britain and her colonies and settlements abroad must arise. The British Government very reasonably desires to limit the extent of its obligations beyond the seas. The Colonial Office is far from adequate to a proper performance of the work that at present devolves upon it; and as the Imperial revenue does not derive any direct benefit from colonial possessions and settlements, while each added one brings with it some new involvements, the British Government looks with an unfavourable eye upon annexations which are, perhaps, of vital interest to its colonies. We have before us, at the present time, the difference of opinion and sentiment between the Mother Country and the Australian Colonies as regards New Guinea and New Hebrides. The Australian Colonies, now growing so rapidly in wealth and population, are naturally on their outlook as regards their future. They say to the British Government: ""Yes, very likely New Guinea and the New Hebrides are of little or no consequence to you, but our interest in their acquisition is a vital one: the Australian countries must have regard to their future, and they do not feel that that future will be what it ought to be unless New Guinea and the New Hebrides are secured from falling into the hands of some other European Power."" A letter which we publish in this present number expresses the apprehension of the British and Native traders in the Trans-Volta district of the Gold Coast Colony, that if the British Government will not authorize that of the Gold Coast to annex the small but commercially important residue of the Coast up to the boundaries of Dahomey (which the legitimate native authorities have more than once prayed the local British Government of the Gold Coast to receive into that colony), it will ere long be taken possession of by the French. This would be another most ""unfriendly act,"" it is true; but after the affair of Porto Novo, we ought to be on our guard, particularly as some daring opposers of the legitimate chiefs hoisted the French flag some time ago. It was from prevision that something of this kind might happen that, some twenty years ago, we advised and assisted in obtaining the annexation of the Sherbro\' countries, as an appendage to the colony of Sierra Leone; and that we advised the annexation of the River countries near Sierra Leone, where French influences have since prevailed to the injury of the colony. We do think that in such cases as Porto Novo, and, again, as the Popos, the British Government should be more alive to the necessity of protecting the interests of its colonies and settlements abroad.'}, {'id': 4697, 'article_title': 'FRENCH ANNEXATIONS', 'full_section_title': 'FRENCH ANNEXATIONS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-19', 'issue_date': '01_10_1883', 'content': 'In a letter dated from Bafoulabe, Senegal, Dr. Bayol reports the results of the explorations he has just accomplished in company with Lieutenant Quinquandou.

It would be impossible, we think, for even the most unreasoning admirer of France, its people, and its Government, to find cause for eulogy in the late external action of the Paris cabinet. With Annam and Tonquin we have nothing to do, though we may have formed our opinions on the subject. As regards Madagascar, we consider the French action, prompted by the Réunion planters, as so certain to lead, if successful, to a new revival of the African slave trade, either open or under the pretence of apprenticeship, or free labour contracts, that, as such, and as a wanton aggression on a community of the African race that has been for some time steadily progressing on the road to civilization, we do not hesitate to give it our most emphatic condemnation. The Government of Liberia, like that of Madagascar, refuses to allow white men to obtain a settlement on any portion of its land by purchase; and although this has greatly interfered with the development of the resources of the country, by shutting out European capital and energy, we can find quite enough in the history of past relations of Europeans with the people of Africa to excuse this policy of isolation. Behind every European acquiring, by purchase, landed possessions in such a country, there looms the national government of that European in the distance, as almost certain to become a factor in any dispute that might arise between him and the authorities. With equal justice, therefore, might France make demands upon Liberia, as upon Madagascar, on the ground of refusal to allow French subjects to become freeholders. What most concerns us, however, as regards the present external action of the French Government, is that portion of it which embraces west and south-west Africa in its disturbing course. We have before alluded to and condemned (and it will bear repetition) the most unfriendly action of France in taking the wretched King Tofa, of Porto Novo, under its protection. We repeat, situate as Porto Novo is with regard to Lagos, together with the non-existence of any real French interest there, the acceptance of a Protectorate by France was about as offensively unfriendly an action as can well be conceived. The French mercantile house that counselled it, has performed about as questionable service to France as was performed by the Portuguese slave trader who led the French Government into a similar measure some twenty years ago. No good can come of it to France, and much evil may. We and all other advocates of the rights of humanity, must now hold her responsible for all the horrors it may please her atrocious protege, King Tofa, to commit. We have a right to demand, in the interests of humanity and civilization, that the French Protectorate of Porto Novo shall be characterized and justified by the absolute repression of those fearful customs in which it has pleased King Tofa and his predecessors to indulge. Such repression has characterized the action of Great Britain in West Africa, and the way in which she has thus exercised her power for freeing the poor wretched victims of tyranny and superstition constitute, in our mind, her only just claim to rule there. Her keeping peace among the natives, and suppressing all slavery and slave trade, so far as within her power; affording protection to trade and commerce, and laying the foundation of civilization on which the natives may hereafter build—these, we say, and to afford protection for philanthropic and missionary enterprise, are her raison d\'etre, on the West Coast. There is no doubt—there can be no doubt—that she might do this work better than she does, if more enlightened councils prevailed in Downing Street; still, what she has done, has been greatly instrumental for good. To feel this fully we have only to imagine what the West Coast of Africa would have been without persistent British interference and guardianship there. And it must always be borne in mind that the imperial exchequer does not receive one farthing from her settlements and possessions, and the protected trade there; while under her liberal free trade system, the ships, subjects, and goods of every other civilized power, European or American, have the same advantages as her own. In a word, she keeps the greater portion of West Africa open to trade and commerce for the benefit of the whole world. Now, the French Colonial system is the very reverse of this. Her protective and prohibitive regulations are in full force at Goree and Senegal; and, by intelligence lately received, we can have no doubt that France is anxious to confer similar benefits on other portions of the West Coast. The French admiral who took Porto Novo under French protection, looked in upon other places on his way down the coast. He made overtures to the King of Bonny, which the king and chief, who have received education in England, were too wise to listen to. And now we learn further that he has proposed to establish a French factory at Old Calabar, and that King Duke Ephraim IX., whose coronation under the auspices of the British consul and the Rev. W. Anderson, we some time since gave an account of, has held a grand council and petitioned the French Government to induce French traders to settle there. Those who do not know anything of the West Coast would suppose from this that French traders were hitherto denied trade with Old Calabar; which, under British consular auspices, has been open for trade to all the world from the period at which Great Britain put a final end to the slave trade there. The intended process is clear. A French factory under Government auspices, perhaps managed by Messrs. Regis, of Marseilles, Lagos, and Porto Novo, who have manipulated the Porto Novo protectorate—a dispute with the natives—French Government demands redress—protection—occupation—a French exclusive trading station, to the exclusion of our Liverpool and German merchants, who now do the great oil trade there.'}, {'id': 4724, 'article_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-20', 'issue_date': '01_11_1883', 'content': 'Nothing easier than all this, and nothing more unsatisfactory, except to French ideas.

The operations of Mons. De Brazza, those of the French ships of war, the indiscreet negotiations of the British Government with that of Portugal, the hoisting of the flag of the great German Empire at Angua Pequena (where, we are now informed, the Bremen firm, who are possibly only the cat's-paws in the matter, have secured by treaty and purchase forty-five miles of coast by a depth of some thirty miles), will all, if we mistake not, be prolific in future results. We have not mentioned the continuous and persistent action of the French Government, from their grand base of the River Senegal, in the construction of the railway that is to unite the Senegal with the River Niger, at the foot of the northern slope of the Kong Mountains, by which they expect—and will, we think, succeed—to monopolize the trade of the Timbuctoo markets. This is a legitimate expansion, which we should like to see, but are not likely to see, imitated by the Government of Great Britain, which, in the pride of its great maritime and commercial super-eminence, scarcely deigns to consider West Africa as worthy of any portion of its regard. Perhaps when Federated Australia and Federated South Africa shall have become quite independent, the Colonial Office in Downing Street will find time to give some real—something more than red tape—attention to West Africa. Meanwhile its destinies seem to be almost the sport of circumstances. The River Gambia and its territories, without any protection for trade on its noble waterway, seem to be fast drifting into the embraces of Senegal, which receives so much attention and protection from the French Government—a process that will be assisted by the firm hold which the French now have of the rivers south of the Gambia, to one of which we perceive they have just now been sending a steam launch. The attentions paid by the French Admiral to various localities during his voyage down the coast have been of a nature to arouse grave apprehensions as regards the future. The assuming for France the protectorate of Porto Novo—thus giving the fiat of approval to the acts of the monster who has there the title and power of king—was so unfriendly an act towards Great Britain that, as we have said when recording the event, we have difficulty in finding adequate words of condemnation. We can only further say that such an act would not have been committed by France or condoned by Great Britain in any other part of the world than West Africa, where Great Britain has only taken possession as against slave-trade and slavery. The Admiral's proceedings at Bonny and Old Calabar confirmed us in the opinion we had formed of the animus of the expedition, while those further down the coast are not of a reassuring character. The French force in those waters is now, we are informed, to be augmented by two vessels of war; so that possible contingencies, not of a pacific nature, seem to be within the apprehension and designs of the French Government, who have made Mons. De Brazza's expedition a national one; as though Madagascar and Tonquin, with Algerian and Senegal extension, were not reasonably enough for even an inordinate public appetite.

The trade with Dahomey, except that oil has been substituted for negroes, is much in the same condition as it was 200 years ago.

The trade of the Ashantees before we acquired their possessions from the Dutch had always been with that nation, and the Fantees had always traded with us. This system had caused many disputes and jealousies between the two races, and there can be little doubt that the Fantees do their best to force all trade between the Ashantees and the coast to pass through their hands, and that the true cause of our difficulties with Ashanti has been this action of the Fantees. It would not be difficult for us to allow the Ashantees free access to a portion of the coast and prevent any collision between them and the Fantees. We could a short time ago have acquired a protectorate over the Ashantees which would have enabled us to have put an end to the human sacrifices which disgrace the country, and prevent the wars and revolutions which now cause such a loss of life and property. Ashanti being accessible to the English merchant, would mean the opening up of the prairie lands which lie behind that kingdom and the coming in contact with Mahometan tribes, whose superior civilization would render them eager customers for Manchester goods. — *Manchester Guardian.*'}, {'id': 5889, 'article_title': 'Affairs on the West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Affairs on the West Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'issue_date': '02_09_1889', 'content': 'A French protectorate is supposed to be in vogue in Porto Novo, but it does not seem to be worth much. In conversation with several intelligent natives I found the almost unanimous wish is to be placed under British protection. On April 25 the people were distressed by a statement of Tofa that he expected the Dahomians to enter the town in seven days. He also sent away his wives, children, and people to the opposite side of the lagoon, where he joined them that night. From a letter recently received from Porto Novo I copied the following extract: “The French have put up a notice calling the people home, but they have no faith in this. All they want is to see the country ceded to the British. King Tofa is now helpless utterly rejected by his subjects. But what can he do? To fight the Dahomians is quite impossible. He has no force to do this. The French, on whom he relies, make no move. To the British Government he cannot apply for fear of the French.” He has no fear of the Dahomians entering the town while the French are there, but the villages from which the town draws the chief portion of its food supplies are utterly defenceless. It would be a great pleasure to see the country in a more settled condition, the people dwelling in security and employing themselves in peaceful and prosperous pursuits.\n\nOld King Gelele of Dahomey is dead.

Crouch states in the current number of *Blackwood\'s Magazine*, that in 1880 a few isolated posts on the banks of the Senegal represented all the land possessed by France on the West Coast of Africa, but year by year the French have added to their territory by a series of campaigns. From the first an armed occupation of the Soudan has been the object of the French pioneers, and at present the territory occupied by the French includes the country watered by the Senegal, and also the upper reaches of the Niger from Segou almost to its source. But the sphere under French influence extends from Soudan Francais to French possessions on the coast between Bathurst and Sierra Leone, and to their settlement on the Gold and Slave Coast. St. Louis, which stands on a small island formed by two branches of the river Senegal, is the centre from which the colony of Soudan Francais has sprung. St. Louis was originally Portuguese, but has been again and again occupied by the French and the English alternately; but eventually St. Louis and Goree were handed over to the French by treaty in 1817. For many years St. Louis was a possession of little value. At the beginning of the last decade a French expedition was detained by a native chief, and some important posts fell into the hands of the Europeans who were sent to chastise him. Then followed a series of campaigns in Africa, the last of which has added Dahomey to French territory. Says Mr. Crouch: ""The actual fighting consists of little more than skirmishes between small and well-equipped European forces and large, but poorly-armed native forces, with the inevitable result that the latter retire, leaving a number of dead and wounded on the field, while the losses of the former are altogether insignificant."" But Mr. Crouch\'s observations do not lead him to think that the tract of country which the French are so eager to obtain will prove worth the expenditure of the lives and money which its acquisition required. A railway between Kayes and St. Louis may bring about a wonderful change, and would develop the resources of the country, but in all probability ""it will be some time before capitalists are likely to encourage the construction of a line from Kayes to St. Louis.""'}, {'id': 6506, 'article_title': 'FRANCE AND LIBERIA', 'full_section_title': 'FRANCE AND LIBERIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1894#article-13', 'issue_date': '01_09_1894', 'content': 'Further, this treaty places Liberia almost in the position of a French protectorate.

Colonies up to a certain period of their political existence, and mere settlements always, are regarded by the Mother Country as without title to any will of their own, and as existing solely for her pleasure and profit, convenience or reputation. The most vital interests of a settlement, as in the case of Lagos and Porto Novo, may demand as indispensable the annexation of an adjoining territory, in obtaining which none but easily overcome objections or difficulties could be met with, while the Mother Country, not seeing any advantage to itself by the desired measure, or having any more than ordinary official solicitude for the well-being of the settlement, turns a deaf ear to all the solicitations of its over-sea subjects, leaving the coveted prize to be carried off by some other European Power, to the discomfort, detriment, and danger of the people who were alive to their wants and interests, present and prospective, but who were without power to do anything of themselves toward the attainment of the reasonable object of their desires.

They were given to understand that the object of the treaty was to divert from Lagos the large trade from the interior which came down the river Ogun to Porto Novo. This river was the only waterway for heavy traffic from the interior to Lagos, and whoever was master at Abeokuta could do as they pleased with the trade. The French were now firmly established at Porto Novo, and they had also got control of another small port to the westward, and the fact of their having that port had a great influence on the tariff at Lagos.

That treaty was intended to form the last link of a chain of agreements which should simplify the relations of the two Powers in that part of Africa, and it is now too late to urge the extension of our political influence into a sphere which has been assigned to France. It is impossible, in territories where the frontier is still vague, for one civilised Government to refuse to acknowledge treaties submitted to it by another on the ground that native signatories of the treaty desire to repudiate it. If such a principle were admitted the only result would be a speedy return to the primitive reign of force. Peaceful agreements with native chiefs would have no meaning, and the civilisation of barbarous countries must be preceded by military occupation. Nor should it be forgotten that if the present position of France in relation to English settlements upon the West Coast of Africa is displeasing to English merchants, they have themselves to thank for the fact that any French settlements now exist.\n3\n\n...ween the River Pongas and the Gaboon.

The memorial pointed out that the occupations by France and the late annexations by Germany of small portions of the West Coast of Africa tended to break the continuity of the British protectorate, and to bring about a greater conflict of national interests. The influence of the British authorities with the natives was lessened, and the introduction of different principles of trading seriously affected the prosperity of British trades. The duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnished the greater portion of the Government revenues. In German and French settlements these articles were free from duty, and being to a great extent sold in the same markets as the British goods, competition became so keen that the loss to British revenue and trade must ultimately be very great. The Committee recommended that the Chamber should ask the Foreign Office that while negotiations regarding African territories were pending, something might be done, by exchange or otherwise, to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from the ports where British trade had become established, and where rivalry upon different commercial and political principles was so injurious. The Government might also take into consideration the extension of the British protectorate to the unoccupied portions of the coast alluded to. It was moved that the Chamber should forward to the Foreign Office a memorial on the lines of that submitted by the African Trade Section. This resolution was unanimously agreed to. At the same meeting a letter was read which had been received from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, asking the Liverpool Chamber to join in a petition to Lord Granville respecting the claims of Portugal on the Congo. The petition stated that authentic information had been received that Portugal was again bringing forward its former pretensions to hold and exercise authority over both banks of the Congo and the adjacent territories, and pointed out the necessity of immediate and effectual steps being taken to secure the renunciation, on the part of Portugal, of any attempt to interfere with the rights of British traders and with the jurisdiction on either side of the Congo and on the adjacent territory.

Lord Knutsford desires me to state for the information of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce that her Majesty\'s Government are now in communication with the French Government upon the whole subject of the relations between the two Governments on the West Coast of Africa.

A quarter of a million sterling, he said, was to be expended in improving Kotono, the harbour of Porto Novo. He is also said to have represented to the native chiefs the advantages of French rule over English. Two lines of steamers have been subsidised by the French Government to call at Kotono.\n\nThe _Journal des Débats_, referring to the above telegram, states that Baron Beeckman, the French Resident at Porto Novo, has ceased to represent France at that place for the last two months, having been replaced by M. Tantin, the Administrator of Senegal, and declares that no new difficulty has arisen between France and England in connexion with the delimitation of their respective territories on the Gulf of Benin. On the contrary, the question now pending was in reality in a fair way of settlement, and the conclusion of a convention was imminent. The journal adds that there is a question of improving Port Kotono by the establishment of a wharf, but the work is being undertaken by a private firm without any financial co-operation from the French administration. In conclusion the journal states that Dr. Bayol, Governor of the South Rivers, will shortly go on a mission to the coast in order to arrange with the native Sovereigns of Dahomey and Porto Novo questions of a complicated nature to which the French protectorate over those portions of the coast has given rise.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-07-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_08_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS AND PORTO NOVO AND SLAVE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Porto Novo, as at present constituted, ruled, and governed, is a standing nuisance to Lagos. The degree in which this nuisance is felt varies from time to time, it being occasionally more or less irritating and noxious; but it is always active, and, as such, always pointing out to the British authorities, and through them, we are bound to suppose, to Her Majesty\'s Government at home, the absolute and indisputable necessity of the only real corrective measure that can possibly be applied with effect. The evil of half measures was never more fully exemplified than in the matter of Porto Novo and the Slave Coast. We do not say that full measures can at all times be adopted and carried out; and therefore we do not intend to impute any blame to the British Government and the agents, who determined and effected the annexation of Lagos, for that they did not at the same time extend the operation and annex Porto Novo. As in the case of Lagos, so in that of Porto Novo, the determination to annex could not proceed from any lust of territory. There was nothing to covet in Lagos—there was and is nothing to covet in Porto Novo, and the coast-line thence to the present supposed boundary of the British possessions near Quittah. There was a work of humanity to be performed at Lagos, where the foreign slave-trade could not possibly be eradicated without annexation; and there is a work of humanity to be performed in annexing Porto Novo, which, in addition to itself offering ""human sacrifices,"" is up to this moment an active feeder of Dahomey with slaves and victims for slaughter; for extending British rule over the whole coastline thence to Quittah, and as far into the interior as may be found necessary for the correction of the enormous evils which prevail, and which operate as a bar to the advance of the West Coast countries to that position of civilization, wealth, and influence to which they must eventually attain, and to which their attaining promptly is for the benefit of the whole civilized world. It has been the solemnly expressed desire of the British Government and people to see the West African settlements raised to the dignity of self-government. But to this they never can be raised—or at least the work of raising will be a very slow, painful, and heavily impeded one—unless Great Britain will perform the onerous duty of removing such hindrances and impediments as that caused by Porto Novo and the other districts to which we have alluded. Nor could there be anything in such an extension of British jurisdiction, calculated to give just ground of complaint to any other European or other civilized Government. Since the adoption by Great Britain of the doctrine and principles of entire freedom of trade, and their application to the whole of her colonial possessions and settlements, without exception, for the subjects of all nations upon the same footing with her own in every respect, she really holds all those over-sea possessions (from which she does not obtain one penny for her own treasury, while she has not unfrequently burdens thrown upon it by them) and administers them, with great trouble and responsibility, for the particular interests of those colonies and settlements and the general interests of mankind at large. No nation known of in the history of the world, ever stood in so high and noble a position; and there is no other nation at the present time of which it could be said, that its annexation of other territories would be thus unattended by injury to the general trade of the world, for the peculiar benefit of itself and its subjects. Having thus shown that there would not be valid ground of objection on the part of any other Power to the annexation of Porto Novo, we may proceed further to show why it is a particular duty on the part of Great Britain to effect that annexation. In separating Lagos from African rule, and putting an end in her to all co-partnership with African abominations and barbarism, we could not at the same time, because of her limited internal resources, put an end to her dependence on neighbouring territories, still under native Governments, not only for the produce necessary to her trade, but also for that indispensable to the daily alimentation of her people. It becomes, therefore, our imperative duty, to adopt and enforce such measures as shall secure to Lagos those supplies which her daily wants require.

We ask again, What does all this mean? With the Madagascar and Tonquin business on their hands, why this display of small energy on the West Coast of Africa? Can it be that the appetite for the River Gambia has of late increased in strength, and that it is wished to have as many insignificant points as possible to yield in exchange for that magnificent possession, for a most valuable ore it would undoubtedly be in the hands of those who already possess the ""Senegal,"" and are at present the great purchasers of its chief produce—""ground nuts""—from which the oil is expressed at Marseilles, where it becomes ""fine Lucca,"" ""best Olive""? But why, we shall be asked, why do you, you who have been calling incessantly upon your own Government to annex the sea-coast from Quittah to Whydah, and to take possession of Porto Novo, and to assume some sort of governing power over the Oil Rivers, why do you complain of French aggression and occupation? In the first place, the circumstances and conditions of Great Britain and France are essentially different; and, in the second, Great Britain differs in its occupations and annexations of foreign barbarous countries, from all other civilized powers. Since the erring and disastrous attempt to tax the people of her then North American colonies, for the benefit of the mother country, Great Britain has never sought to derive revenue for the Imperial exchequer from any of her beyond sea possessions. Until she adopted and put into universal practice in her colonies and possessions (such as had not legislatures of their own) of the principles of free trade, every acquisition of territory in West Africa, or Fiji, or New Guinea, or elsewhere, is an occupation by her for the benefit and advantage of the manufacturers and commercial people of every other state and power. She holds and administers for the general benefit of the people whom she and her subjects are seeking to civilize, and of the world at large. Not from any one of her Colonies or possessions does she draw one farthing of revenue into and for the benefit of the Imperial exchequer. But France, if she takes possession of territory, establishes therein her exclusive system. She takes possession for the benefit of French manufacturing industry, and shipping, and commerce, to the exclusion of all other. Let her open the ports of her Colonies and possessions to the British flag and to British commerce, as Great Britain opens hers to the French flag and to French commerce, and no one would hail with more pleasure than we should do her ""occupation,"" however extensive, of the uncivilized portions of the habitable world. But even then she should do what is worthy of a great nation, and not make little, unworthy, pettifogging attacks upon the tranquillity of semi-civilized people. We had intended in this number of our journal to have entered at large upon this subject, in consequence of her recent action at Black Point, Porto Novo, and Bonny. But ""the unexpected,"" which so often frustrates the carrying out of human intentions, prevents our doing so; and we are compelled to content ourselves with blaming anew the British Government for its culpable indifference to the welfare of Lagos, in turning a deaf ear to all the entreaties of which the friends of Lagos have been prodigal, that possession should be taken of Porto Novo, and the barbarous cruelties of its abominable rulers be put an end to by the enforcement of British Law. We feel this very much. We were partly influential in obtaining the occupation and annexation of Lagos; and we always urged that its Government should be made to embrace Porto Novo. We were opposed in this by the old influence that made of Whydah a depôt for free African labourers for the French plantations, as a substitute for the suppressed African Slave Trade. We had hoped that influence had abandoned the Lagos Waters, and was now operating only on the East of Africa and in Madagascar.

Our friends across the Channel seem to have awakened with a vengeance from that lethargic state of timidity and hesitation which has always been more or less imputed to them in their colonial undertakings. They have been showing for some time past an energy quite unprecedented in their colonial history, an energy which, far from diminishing, seems, on the contrary, to be increasing day by day. Nor is this increased activity entirely due to the efforts of one or two political men of standing, either from patriotic or interested motives, but to the general feeling gaining ground in France that it is to the interest of the nation and her citizens to create outlets for trade, and to hasten while it is yet time to claim those parts of the Dark Continent not yet under the protection of other Powers.\n\nThis feeling is, little by little, gaining the masses. There are many facts which tend to prove this, such as the founding in important ports—Marseilles, Bordeaux, &c.—of colonial museums and colonial schools, the starting of colonial papers, the eagerness with which large wholesale suppliers, such as the directors of the Bon Marché and Magasins du Louvre, Paris, hasten to supply explorers like Monteil and Mizon with samples of various merchandise. Another significant fact, and one which must not be overlooked, is that an active colonial policy finds fewer opponents in the Chamber every year. It is palpable to every one that France has returned at these last elections a stronger Colonial party than she has ever done before.\n\nAll these things should not be lost sight of by those who have the welfare of our West African colonies at heart.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary.

The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend. Silks and carpets from Turkey and Tripoli, natron from Borno, and Hausa textiles, were exchanged for kola nuts, gold, cotton materials from Dagomba, Mossi and Mande, shea butter and livestock from the Sudanese Sahel."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation', 'content': ""There were exceptions to this situation of tension between the powerful traders and the general populace.

At this time, trade in slaves (which had not been prominent under the Kamba) seems to have become more important. Kamba traditions picture this as the most disruptive period in their history: disruptive famine led to inter-lineage conflicts that were used by ambitious members of society to sell weaker ones to Arabs.$^{17}$ Kamba traditions, therefore, rightly indicate the relationship between the decline of trade in goods in which they themselves played a major part and the rise of the system of profiteering in persons in which the Arabs and Swahili traders played a prominent role.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation.

In bygone days the Okrika people did a fair trade with the Bonny men, but now take all their oil to New Calabar, and dispose of it there.

The Bonny man would represent to the man of Okrika that the trader offered him a much lower price than in reality was tendered, and upon the bargain being closed would draw from the store the amount actually offered by the white man, and give to the Okrika man the small amount which he had represented as the offer by the trading firm.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Present Depression in all Branches of African Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Yet the Government is not alone to blame. Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods.

While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.597, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Occasionally African producers defended their interests collectively through hold-ups (refusals to deliver produce to market).

This time, the hold-up was extended to Western Nigeria, and it ended only with the intervention of the British government.

This ensuing era of fresh British expansion in Southern Africa has generated much discussion among historians. Antony Atmore and Shula Marks$^{28}$ in particular have sum› marized succinctly the current interpretations and have gone on to offer some new ideas which, in turn, have generated further research. 29 Atmore and Marks argue that the scholars who have relied most heavily on 'the official record' such as R. Robinson and J. Gallagher, broadly recognize the importance of economic factors in explaining late nineteenthcentury British imperialism, 'but veer sharply away from any further and more precise economic analysis of the events they portray, whether in South Africa or elsewhere.' Instead, the 'official mind' historians see British expansion, in the final analysis, as occurring when policy-makers are drawn irresistibly into the African (including the South African) interior to stop 'crises or emergencies' on the 'frontier' or 'periphery' of their formal colonial holdings or informal empire. However, what is omitted, Atmore and Marks point out, is the thorough analysis of these crises, which in the end proved so crucial for the creation of the British empire. In fact, when these crises are explored, they reveal that they were actually 'related to the break-down of indigenous authorities under the weight of the demands of an increasingly industrialized Britain.' In the early nineteenth century these pressures occurred mostly on the eastern front in South Africa, where the informal agents of industrialized Britain - the missionaries, traders, and administrators - were active. But with mineral discoveries in the interior in the late nineteenth century, the demands of industrialized Britain rapidly shifted there and were imposed upon both the African states and the Boer republics. Thus, although the strategic importance of the Cape on the sea route to India continued to influence British imperial policy in South Africa in the late nineteenth century, expanding British economic interests in the subcontinent weighed preponderantly."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.609, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British expansion in South Africa 1870-80', 'content': 'The annexation of Lesotho represented a change in the British policy of withdrawal from territory north of the Orange river. The change became even more apparent with the disallowing of Transvaal territorial expansion in 1868 and the annexation of Griqualand West in 1871. British expansion coincided with the era of mineral discoveries in Southern Africa. In 1867 a diamond was picked up at Hope Town in the Cape Colony, and the following year alluvial and dry digging for diamonds started along the Vaal river towards its junction with the Orange river. In 1868 an elephant hunter called Henry Hartley and Carl Mauch, a geologist, reported the existence of gold deposits between the Ndebele and Ngwato countries as well as in Mashonaland. Even though the gold discoveries proved largely illusory, they initially aroused a great deal of interest both in South Africa and Britain, while diamond mining grew rapidly into a major South African industry.\nPresident Pretorius, whose state seemed chronically poor, saw a chance of pulling it out of its predicament by enlarging its borders in such a way that it encompassed most of the known mineral deposits and had an outlet to the sea. In April 1868 he announced that his republic stretched north and west to Lake Ngami and east to include a small section of the coast line south of Delagoa Bay. The Portuguese, who had the tiny village of Maputo near Delagoa Bay, and the British missionaries and traders whose road to Central Africa was threatened, all protested vigorously and put pressure on the government to prevent the Boer expansion.

It was divided into British colon› ies, Boer republics and African states. Up to the 1870s Britain, which claimed supremacy in the subcontinent, hesitated from translating its claims into reality by taking over the political control of the whole region. Many of the British officials on the spot urged the British government to do so, arguing that the best way to meet British interests and at the same time be fair to the various peoples of South Africa was to bring the whole area under British rule. Successive British governments shied away from such responsibilities because of the expenses involved. It was indeed a potentially costly enterprise, because it meant conquering what looked like a multitude of African states, subduing the Boer republics (which were wedded to their independence), persuading the British colonies to join up with these states, and finally subsidizing the administration of the then very poor country. But from the 1870s onwards, with the onset of the European 'New Imperialism', the discoveries of diamonds and gold as well as the concomitant expanding British investments in the region, the British changed their minds and energetically sought to extend their hegemony throughout the subcontinent. By the end of the period, the British had conquered and annexed many African societies, afforded protection to others and humbled by force of arms the most recalcitrant and powerful of them - the Zulu. The British efforts to control more firmly the South African societies had further led them to war with the Boers. Because of these wars and their aftermath (arrangements involving either outright annexation or loose sovereignty) Britain could justifiably claim, among other European powers, at least by 1881, to have a hold on South Africa that was something more than simply a sphere of influence.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest. Coupled with the internal disputes were the increasing border quarrels with Lesotho. Boshof decided to check the border disputes by invading Lesotho in March 1858. By converging on Thaba Bosiu, Moshoeshoe's stronghold, the Boer commandos left their rear exposed, which was then raided by the Lesotho army. The Boers abandoned the struggle as they went back home to defend their families and property.

Carnarvon appointed Shepstone to be the Special Commissioner for the Transvaal and on 9 October 1876 empowered him to take over the republic with or without the consent of its volksraad. Various motives for the annexation of the Transvaal have been suggested. The Transvaal was known to contain mineral deposits that made it potentially the richest part of South Africa. The Transvaal blocked the free flow of labour from within Transvaal and from the neighbouring regions. The Transvaal government was also threatening to build a railway to Delagoa Bay so that it could not only be independent of the British colonial harbours but also threaten British supremacy by entering into relations with foreign powers. Carnarvon further calculated that the annexation of the Transvaal would result in the encirclement of the Orange Free State and therefore force the latter to come to terms. Shepstone's take-over of the Transvaal on 12 April 1877, though clumsy and not calculated to conciliate the Boers, was relatively simple because the republic was bankrupt and its president unpopular. 41 Having annexed it, Carnarvon appointed Sir Bartle Frere as the Governor and High Commissioner to carry his 'scheme of federation into effect.' 42 Frere's task was far from easy. The Cape Colony refused to take the lead in the confederation movement; its leaders regarded the British efforts to encourage it to do so as unwanted interference with its responsible status. The Orange Free State was also against being dragged into the union.

The Transvaal therefore retreated to the north of the Vaal river to safeguard its independence, leaving Grey to encourage the Free State to take steps towards unity with the Cape Colony.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British expansion in South Africa 1870-80', 'content': ""The discovery of diamonds meanwhile sparked off territorial disputes among the Transvaal, Orange Free State, Waterboer's Griqualand West, the Rolong and the Tlhaping.

With a large force of infantry and cavalry, he met Moshoeshoe at Platberg on 15 December 1852 and delivered an ultimatum that was impossible to fulfil. Moshoeshoe was ordered to produce within three days 1000 horses and 10 000 cattle, which would be used as com› pensation for the Boer property lost during the Warden war and also to finance Cathcart's own current expensive expedition.

Moshoeshoe beseeched the High Commissioner to be content with the loot of over 5000 cattle which the Governor's troops had managed to capture.

The very fact of the Dutch local Government at Elmina continuing up to this very day to send their agents with gold and goods into the interior to purchase slaves for shipment to their colonies in the East, is alone sufficient to convince impartial men that they are not likely, at least for some time to come, to do much good out here.

The Dutch Government and Chambers, as we showed twelve months ago, disliked, the one to propose, and the other to grant, the annual vote of nearly 12,000l. sterling for the expenses of those settlements. It is, no doubt, owing to this that so great a number of offices are now held there by one individual, the Dutch system being that the acting official, in the absence of any one regularly appointed, does not draw salary, receiving payment from one office only, with an occasional gratuity or small allowance in one or two other cases. This affords a striking contrast with the system that prevails in our own settlements, where an official may hold, in addition to his regular employment, half a dozen acting ones, drawing for each and every one of the latter one-half of the full salary, in addition to the full salary of his proper office. An official of 400l. a-year may be thus receiving 1,000l. a-year, if a pet of the Governor\'s. But the parsimony of the Dutch Government in the matter of its African employes, whose salaries are all ridiculously small when compared with ours, is not the worst feature of their system.

Unfortunately, however, the Dutch Government, which occupies or owns a large number of forts or posts intermixed with, and in many instances in close proximity to our own, has never imposed any duty on the admission of goods through its settlements, and any duties which we may levy must therefore be fixed at so low a rate as not to render it worth the importer's while to land his goods in Dutch waters, and carry on his trade under Dutch protection, for the purpose of evading the duty. For several years past no opportunity has been lost of impressing upon the Netherlands Government that, were they to join with our own in the imposition of a specific, but not oppressive rate of duty on articles, the introduction of which cannot be beneficial to the natives, as arms, gunpowder, tobacco, and spirits, with a small _ad valorem_ duty of 3 or 4 per cent. on all other imports, a revenue would be raised sufficient to maintain effective establishments without making, as is now done, any charge on the Home Governments, and which would also enable the local Governments to do much for the improvement of the social condition of the natives. Our efforts, however, have been hitherto unsuccessful, the Netherlands Government, though not denying the possibility of attaining these results, is not disposed to incur the risk which so complete a change of its policy might entail, and at present continues to pay between 7,000l. and 8,000l. a-year for the support of its influence amongst the few natives who recognise its authority, and for the protection of a somewhat insignificant trade. The only positive advantage which it is understood to derive from the possession of the settlements is, that it has been able to enter into arrangements with some of the friendly chiefs, and it is still with the Ashantee Government, by which they are permitted to obtain annually a certain number of natives, whom it sends out to be trained as soldiers for the protection of Java and its East India dependencies.\n\nOn the Gold Coast the cowrie is used as the currency in all small transactions.

""What can be done with countries where only a very paltry revenue can be raised, and for which England is not disposed to make pecuniary sacrifices?"" has long been a general answer to all remonstrances. That ""paucity of revenue"" was no doubt a great obstacle in the way of improvements. Nor did the removal of the obstacle depend solely upon the British Government. The Dutch and British possessions were mixed up together on the Gold Coast; the Dutch would not make any arrangement with the English for levying uniform duties, and, indeed, declined levying any duties at all. There was consequently an arbitrary limit to the amount of duties which the British could impose. Increased beyond a certain amount, all trade must have gone to the free Dutch ports, and no revenue whatever would have been obtained. There were other evils involved in the Dutch occupation, which moved us to make strenuous efforts for effecting the purchase of the Dutch settlements by the British Government. Those exertions have failed because of the real or alleged incompetency of the Dutch Government to alienate any Dutch territory, except for a territorial equivalent. We regret this, and deeply, too, not because we are desirous of territorial aggrandisement for Great Britain, but because, notwithstanding our great failure of duty hitherto, we do believe the future Christian civilization and material prosperity of those countries to depend upon the continued presence of the British flag on the Gold Coast. It being impossible to obtain the Dutch possessions by purchase, even if the British Government could be brought to make the investment, the only alternative, if any good was to be hoped for, was an exchange and consolidation of Coast possessions by the Dutch and English Governments, coupled with an undertaking for a uniform rate of import duties. Negotiations with this object have been for some time in progress, and rumour has anticipated the fact of their favourable termination. But we believe we are correct in stating, that if not actually concluded in the manner that we and our friends on the Coast desire, they are at least so far advanced toward that point as to allow of our treating the exchange, &c., as un fait accompli. We have before us a Dutch Government map showing the proposed exchange. A line is drawn into the interior from Elmina. All to westward of this bears the Dutch colour, all to eastward the British. When the exchange is effected, Dix Cove, Apollonia, and Commendah will become Dutch possessions, while Cormantine, Apam, Mouree, Barracoe, and Dutch Accra will in future belong to Great Britain. As the line is drawn from the Coast to the Praah, and shows the whole of Wassaw, &c., under Dutch tint, we presume that Great Britain will have acquiesced in that renunciation of her protectorate made some time since by the Wassaws, and will not again receive them under it. This will not, of course, make the Wassaws Dutch, any more than it will make the Fantees, Assins, &c., English, but it will most likely be understood as preventing any interference by Great Britain in future with the native laws and administration, &c., in Wassaw, so long as Wassaw remains at peace with the countries of the British Protectorate.

Its ancient policy was to nourish a genius for war, because the chiefs believed that no state could be aggrandised otherwise than by the glory and the trophies of conquest. Its modern convictions, as manifested in its latest diplomatic muniments, are no better. Besides, the opinion is popularly received and admitted at Coomassie that trade is an agent that enervates, and that no trader can protect his country against the incursions of the ambitious neighbours who wait only for opportunities of aggression.\n\nThe rulers of Ashantee are tormented by another spectre. They are afraid that the encouragement of trade may increase the artfulness of the trader, and that in time the trader might become the member of a body too formidable and too crafty for resistance from the Government.\n\nThe kings of Ashantee viewed, also, with excessive anxiety the importation of guns and powder into their kingdom.

Since the publication of the report of the Committee of the House of Commons I have regarded the relinquishment by Great Britain of the settlement on the Gold Coast as only a matter of time. Although, both on national and Christian grounds, I dissent from the policy which dictates such a measure, and believe it greatly erroneous, still, as I have no hope of seeing it reversed, I frankly adopt it. Devoted to the cause of African material development as the means toward higher and nobler ulterior results, I am most anxious that such relinquishment shall not be made until the people shall be fitted for self-government; and that all practical measures shall be adopted for hastening the period at which the desire expressed by the Parliamentary Committee can be accomplished, under such circumstances that the progress of Christian civilisation and material development in the Gold Coast territories shall not be prejudiced, nor England dishonoured by the act. Now England never can leave her settlements on the Gold Coast while the Netherlands retains hers. It would be an act leading inevitably to such horrible results as to call down upon England the just reprobation of the whole civilised world. The feelings with which the Dutch are regarded everywhere, except within Elmina and one or two other small towns, and the intimate alliance between the Dutch and Ashantees, would render any better class of results impossible. The Dutch have been a curse to the Gold Coast, and the good intentions of Her Majesty's Government toward it must continually be frustrated while they remain there. Acting on this conviction, which was justified by then passing events, I urged, long before the sitting of the said Parliamentary Committee, that Her Majesty's Government should buy out the Dutch. The Dutch did not then levy any duties, consequently had no revenue, and their occupation entailed a dead loss of about 12,000l. a-year, greatly to the displeasure of many members of the Dutch Legislature. The only recompense of the Dutch was in their power of obtaining 300 or 400 slaves yearly from their Ashantee allies, under the name of volunteers, to reinforce their troops in Java. But this might have been overcome had Her Majesty's Government seriously endeavoured to overcome it. Circumstances have since changed. The African recruits for Java are, I believe, no longer deemed to be indispensable; but under the Exchange of Territories Treaty between Great Britain and the Netherlands the Dutch are now levying duties, which last year are estimated to have yielded 6,000l., and would have yielded 30,000l., could the treaty have been peacefully carried out. Owing, however, to faults inherent to the Treaty itself, and further to the wrong and injudicious measures adopted in the exchange, a state of hostility has resulted between the Dutch authorities and the Fantee tribes, which has been aggravated and irremediably envenomed by the atrocities committed by the Ashantees acting in alliance with the Dutch, and thus fully justifying the fears, suspicions, and determination of the Fantees as regards the supposed rights conferred on the Dutch under the said treaty; so that while the Dutch have only obtained some 6,000l. revenue, the measures they have been compelled to adopt to maintain their position on the coast have probably cost 60,000l.; and this only to increase their future difficulties there.""}, {'id': 2394, 'article_title': ""Classpeter and Sawyer's Case"", 'full_section_title': ""Classpeter and Sawyer's Case"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_02_1873#article-10', 'issue_date': '28_02_1873', 'content': '**""WHAT WILL HE DO WITH IT?""**  \nTo have hinted, a few years back, at the possibility of a great fact which confronts us to-day, would have been to expose oneself to unmeasured ridicule.

Lord Grey had lately written several letters on this subject, and he had recommended the setting up, under English protection, of an elaborate Fanti Confederation on the West Coast of Africa; that was to say, that we were to establish an elaborate system of government among a lot of men whose conversations with Sir Garnet Wolseley, as reported in the *Daily News*, showed that they were not even able to defend themselves from their own tribes, even when under English pay and led by English officers. We were asked to set up an elaborate government of such men on the West Coast of Africa. He believed that by doing so we should not only incur an enormous expenditure of money, but should sacrifice the lives of many Englishmen. Our Government ought to have been informed of all the circumstances. Why, only ten years ago we had almost the same circumstances, and in the same order in which they were occurring now. We had an Ashanti war in 1863. We had West India troops marched up the country in just the same way as it was proposed they should now, and that march on Coomassie failed on account of the loss of life in the swamp.""  \n—*Sir C. Dilke*, Nov. 13.\n\n""My colleague (Sir C. Dilke) has given you his views on the Ashanti war in particular, and on our colonial policy in general.

For myself, I agree with Lord Derby, that England has black men enough, and should not go in for any more.

According to the writings of Bosman (1700) the Dutch appeared to be the principal traders and factors on the Coast, and to have built many of the chief forts. From the admissions of the author, they were adepts in the practice of cheating the Natives in their dealings with them for gold. The writer appears to have received instructions to make himself acquainted with the history and resources of the Gold Coast and the country inland as much as possible, and, considering the time and the circumstances under which he was placed, also the difficulty of acquiring information, he has handed down a work containing much valuable information to those interested in the production of gold and other minerals on the West Coast of Africa. He says: ""Guinea is a large country, extending several hundred miles, abounding with innumerable kingdoms and commonwealths. The Gold Coast, being a part of Guinea, is extended about sixty miles, beginning with the Gold River, three miles west of Assini or twelve above Axim, and ending with the village Ponni, seven or eight miles east of Accra. The negro inhabitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold, which they chiefly vend to the English and Zealand interlopers, notwithstanding the severe penalty they incur thereby, for if we catch them their so-bought goods are not only forfeited, but a heavy fine is laid upon them. Not deterred, I say, by this, they all hope to escape, to effect which they bribe our slaves (who are set as watch or spies over them) to let them pass by night, by which means we are hindered from having one hundredth part of the gold of this land; and the plain reason why the Natives run the risk of trading with the interlopers is that their goods are sometimes better than ours and always to be had one-third cheaper, whereby they are encouraged against the danger, very well knowing that a successful correspondence will soon enrich them."" Human nature on the Gold Coast and the desire to get gold—honestly if possible, but to get it—was much the same two centuries ago as now. The English, who were then termed by the Dutch as interlopers, now hold full sway over the country, but have not as yet given much encouragement to the development of the vast gold resources of the country. Accounts from the Congo show that barbarities practised on the Natives and white men by the Belgians are as bad as in the worst days of the slave trade. On my return from the Coast in 1881 I strongly advised the opening of communication with the goldfields from the convenient port of Axim by a system of light rail or tramway (narrow gauge), the trucks for goods and passengers to have been run by Natives, which would have materially assisted the more rapid development of the gold fields. Thus, commencing with a line along the coast from Axim to the mouth of the Ankobra River inside the bar, we should reach the valley of this river, an immense area of auriferous country, with well proved quartz lodes and other formations at various places. The river affords good water way, say, as far as Tomento, and sometimes much beyond. At landing stages like Tomento, leading to Tacquats and other places, the light railways should have been laid to the mining camps, for facilitating easy carriage of goods and passengers. Thus a traveller now requires six Native bearers to carry him about twelve miles a day, whereas on a light railway, as I specially designed, the passengers could be run by Native runners (in relays, say, of ten miles) 50 miles a day easily, and in much more comfort. I pointed this out to the Government authorities before this last Ashanti expedition. People do not go to the West Gold Coast of Africa to grow fruit or cereals, their chief object is gold, and it is to the profitable opening of the goldfields and establishing easy means of communications by light railways we must look to speedily and effectively bring about the increase of the supply of gold from that quarter. A system of river dredging and washing of the sand drifted up in places along the coast could be made highly profitable if properly taken in hand, but the difficulty of efficient management blocks the way. The Government must take measures to inaugurate a better system of travelling inland than by the carriage of men or goods on the heads of native bearers. Light railways, either run by steam or Native power, will be the only means of successfully developing the auriferous resources of the West Gold Coast of Africa.—Yours, &c.,'}]","[{'document_title': 'DUTCH AFRICAN SETTLEMENTS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""My Lord,—I beg leave to draw your lordship's attention to important and pressing matters connected with Her Majesty's Settlements on the Gold Coast. Since the publication of the report of the Committee of the House of Commons I have regarded the relinquishment by Great Britain of the settlement on the Gold Coast as only a matter of time. Although, both on national and Christian grounds, I dissent from the policy which dictates such a measure, and believe it greatly erroneous, still, as I have no hope of seeing it reversed, I frankly adopt it. Devoted to the cause of African material development as the means toward higher and nobler ulterior results, I am most anxious that such relinquishment shall not be made until the people shall be fitted for self-government; and that all practical measures shall be adopted for hastening the period at which the desire expressed by the Parliamentary Committee can be accomplished, under such circumstances that the progress of Christian civilisation and material development in the Gold Coast territories shall not be prejudiced, nor England dishonoured by the act. Now England never can leave her settlements on the Gold Coast while the Netherlands retains hers. It would be an act leading inevitably to such horrible results as to call down upon England the just reprobation of the whole civilised world. The feelings with which the Dutch are regarded everywhere, except within Elmina and one or two other small towns, and the intimate alliance between the Dutch and Ashantees, would render any better class of results impossible. The Dutch have been a curse to the Gold Coast, and the good intentions of Her Majesty's Government toward it must continually be frustrated while they remain there. Acting on this conviction, which was justified by then passing events, I urged, long before the sitting of the said Parliamentary Committee, that Her Majesty's Government should buy out the Dutch. The Dutch did not then levy any duties, consequently had no revenue, and their occupation entailed a dead loss of about 12,000l. a-year, greatly to the displeasure of many members of the Dutch Legislature. The only recompense of the Dutch was in their power of obtaining 300 or 400 slaves yearly from their Ashantee allies, under the name of volunteers, to reinforce their troops in Java. But this might have been overcome had Her Majesty's Government seriously endeavoured to overcome it. Circumstances have since changed. The African recruits for Java are, I believe, no longer deemed to be indispensable; but under the Exchange of Territories Treaty between Great Britain and the Netherlands the Dutch are now levying duties, which last year are estimated to have yielded 6,000l., and would have yielded 30,000l., could the treaty have been peacefully carried out. Owing, however, to faults inherent to the Treaty itself, and further to the wrong and injudicious measures adopted in the exchange, a state of hostility has resulted between the Dutch authorities and the Fantee tribes, which has been aggravated and irremediably envenomed by the atrocities committed by the Ashantees acting in alliance with the Dutch, and thus fully justifying the fears, suspicions, and determination of the Fantees as regards the supposed rights conferred on the Dutch under the said treaty; so that while the Dutch have only obtained some 6,000l. revenue, the measures they have been compelled to adopt to maintain their position on the coast have probably cost 60,000l.; and this only to increase their future difficulties there."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-04-19', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1871#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast Roads and the Dutch Settlements on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing the leader on ""Spurious Official Martyrs,"" motived by Sir Arthur Kennedy\'s letter in the *Times*, under the signature of ""Englishman,"" we had fully purposed not to allow this number of our journal to go to press without entering fully upon the discussion of the two above-mentioned subjects, which, in addition to the ""martyrdom,"" form the staple of that letter—viz., Cape Coast Roads, and Dutch obstinacy and selfishness in not giving up Elmina, &c., to the British authorities. We published in this paper a few months ago, Sir Arthur Kennedy\'s letter to the Secretary of State, in reply to one which we had addressed to the Colonial-office urging that there should be no further delay in commencing roads from Cape Coast, &c., to be carried forward eventually to the borders of Ashanti. In a subsequent number of our journal we examined the supposed argument of that letter of the Governor-in-Chief, and proved, we think, that the objections urged by him were puerile and unworthy. We regret that circumstances prevent our entering with equal fulness at this moment upon the consideration of his last effort in disproof of the possibility and utility of roads in the Gold Coast districts. It is too large and important a subject, and one which has been a theme with us for too many years, to allow us to limit our remarks so rigidly as we should be compelled to do, if we attempted to fulfil now the intention to which we have above alluded. We will, however, consider Sir Arthur Kennedy\'s new excuses, as well as re-consider, possibly, his old ones, in our next issue. Equally must we defer the observations we intended to make on the paragraphs in ""Englishman\'s"" letter, bearing on the projected cession of the Dutch possessions to Great Britain. We cannot, however, here defer remarking that it has become the fashion of late with Sir A. Kennedy and others to allude to the projected cession of the Dutch possessions as a benefit which *they* had prepared, and were about to bestow on the Gold Coast; and this is clearly again insinuated by ""Englishman"" in his letter, where he makes the Dutch withdrawal a sort of foundation-stone of some great policy of Mr. Usher\'s ""who has had the head to achieve what his heart had suggested to him should be brought about;"" but that ""his ability and his desire to follow out the dictates of a kindly disposition are paralysed by the obstinacy, the selfishness, and the proximity of the Dutch."" What is this but a sort of effort to attribute all the disgraceful failures of Mr. Usher\'s administration to his policy throughout having been frustrated by the Dutch, obstinately continuing to remain ""between the wind and his nobility""? The cession of the Dutch Settlements on the Gold Coast to Great Britain was conceived, urged, and ardently promoted by friends of Africa years ago—before there was any prospect of a governor-generalship for Sir Arthur Kennedy to administer, or a Mr. Usher was ever dreamed of as a possible administrator of the Gold Coast. With these brief remarks we reluctantly postpone all further consideration of these two important subjects until next month.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1871#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'RESISTANCE TO DUTCH RULE ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The attempt to carry out the stipulations of the treaty between the Dutch and English Governments for *exchange of territories* on the Gold Coast has led to events which again raise the question, and this in a very practical way, of *what have been and are the respective rights and claims of the above-mentioned Powers on those countries.* A brief *resume* of what has led to the present position of affairs is here indispensable. The Dutch and English Governments each occupied or claimed certain positions on and certain portions of the coast line between Apollonia and the River Volta. These positions and portions were not continuous and annexed, but were intermingled, Dutch with English. For many reasons this had long been considered as very unsatisfactory. The British Government, at least for the thirty-five years ending in 1865, had been by treaty and agreement the *protector* of all the countries between the before-mentioned points, and the sea and the line of the River Prah, against their old devastators and foes, the Ashantees. The Dutch, on the other hand, holding Elmina from the Ashantees, were allies of that power, and even so late as in the troubles of 1863 and 1864 supplied the Ashantees with munitions of war when they were in hostilities with the people of the British Protectorate. The British, throwing the shield of their power over the Territories, and making *some* exertions, however inadequate and unsatisfactory, for the advancement of Christian civilization and the development of resources, levied certain small *ad valorem* customs duties on imports; the Dutch, doing no such things, and holding their possessions merely for trade, and to enable them to obtain a few hundred slaves every year to ship to Java for military service there under the name of hired volunteers, levied no customs duties whatever, so that the whole charge for the Dutch establishments fell upon Holland, to the amount of about ten or twelve thousand pounds a-year. The real friends of progress on the Coast wished that the British Government should buy out the Dutch in the same way that they had some years ago bought out the Danes. But no hearty effort was ever made in this direction; the Dutch felt reluctant to sell because they wanted those 300 *recruits* every year for their Java forces, and so it was easily assumed they would not sell. An effort was then made, as the next best thing, to get them to impose customs duties upon a tariff to be agreed upon for both Dutch and English ports. This the Dutch refused most resolutely, unless Great Britain would consent to an exchange with them of certain points and positions before-mentioned, so that the Dutch might possess the whole coast line from Elmina to Apollonia, and the British the whole from Elmina on the other side to the River Volta, &c. It was well known that the Dutch coveted a sort of claim to the Wassaw countries, which are rich in gold, and which lie between their now coast line and Ashantee. The British Government, in virtue of their protectorate, had exercised at intervals a species of jurisdiction over all those interior countries, while the Dutch never had any claims or pretensions or exercised any jurisdiction whatever, except at and immediate to the several places they occupied or claimed on the Coast. To speak in general terms, the British were popular throughout all those countries until 1865, and the Dutch were very unpopular, notwithstanding their admission of goods duty free. When an exchange of territories, as it has been termed, was mooted, we stated our belief that this was impracticable, because, however willing the people at the points occupied and claimed by the Dutch might be to come under British jurisdiction, those who were under this would never consent to go under the Dutch, whom, as allies of the Ashantees, they looked upon as their enemies. We were told, however, by authorities, or supposed authorities, that this could all be arranged; and assuming this, as the British people would not advance to the Coast the money which was requisite for effecting some of that good which we so ardently desire, we were glad of a Dutch and British customs duty arrangement which would supply some of the funds indispensable for that object. When the treaty, to come into operation on the 1st of January, 1868, was ratified on the 5th of July last, it was but natural we should presume that the interval would be sedulously and earnestly employed by the representatives on the Coast of the so-called Christian Government of England to prepare the people really or nominally under them (if they were not already prepared) for the stipulated exchange. Could any reasonable man have supposed that, having to do, as they had to do in this case, with human beings, and not with mere chattels or things, they would leave all the duties of governors in so delicate a case entirely unfulfilled; and content themselves with notifying to the people concerned only a few days before the event was to take place, that they were to be transferred like so many cattle or pigs to a new owner? Could we or any sane man have supposed that they would in such a case as this have brought anew upon the British Government the heavy reproach, to which we alluded last month, that they seemed to consider their ""government existed only to collect revenue for the benefit of favoured officials;"" an additional proof of which the late Governor-General gave, even in the very act, it may be said, of taking over the new possessions, by beginning to apportion the increased revenues among the favoured crew? No; if we had hazarded such an assumption, we should have been vituperated as calumniators of virtuous, high-minded, and enlightened officials! as pestilent tribunes of the people striving to bring legitimate authority into contempt. Contempt, forsooth! why the whole British administration of the Coast has for some time past been beneath contempt; has been such as it could never have been had this long divinely-favoured country of Great Britain been caught in the toils of rationalistic infidelity on the one hand, and a besotted superstition on the other, which are hurrying her into that abyss where so many ruined nations already lie. And what has been the result of this most shameful abnegation of the duties of government for which and for previous *merits* Colonel Blackall has been inflicted on the British colonists of Queensland? This, that while there was a grumbling opposition, a more or less manifested determination against the Dutch rule everywhere, at British Commendah the exasperation of the people culminated; they would not in any way acknowledge Dutch masters, and declared this so unmistakably that the Dutch Commander, *in the presence of the British Administrator, who was there to hand over the place,* bombarded the village, destroyed not only it but the canoes, the means of livelihood of its people; and constrained them to take refuge, with their sick, their aged, and their little ones, in the wild bush behind, as stated in our last, and in our letters which we now publish.

They will be able to trace much of their onward progress clearly up to the 6th April, 1872, when the Dutch flag was lowered and that of England hoisted in its place amid salvos of artillery and other fitting demonstrations. The whole of the sea-coast from Asinee to Popo is now under one sole and only protection and jurisdiction. One of our great desires is thus realized. There is now no longer a European patron of Fetish and many other abominations on one side of a river, and on the other another European power, which, whatever its faults and shortcomings, has persistently endeavoured to put an end to such horrors wherever its powers could be made to extend. The evils caused, and the possibility of good prevented by the presence of the Dutch on the Gold Coast, it would be difficult to overstate. It is indeed, therefore, a matter for congratulation that they have definitively withdrawn from all their former possessions there, and that there is at least no longer any European influence to neutralize such efforts as Great Britain may make, and encourage to be made, for promoting the spread of Christian civilization and the development of the magnificent resources of countries which we feel sure are destined to furnish rich supplies to the ever-craving markets of Europe. A sincere and generous recognition and adoption of the Fanti Confederation as a co-worker under British auspices, will do much to hasten both the civilization and development. We are glad, therefore, to learn that, so far as can be gathered from the utterances of the Governor-in-Chief, Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, at Elmina, there is reason to believe that the views we have enunciated in our letters to Earl Kimberley and articles in our journal, are approved by the Governor-in-Chief, and recommended to Her Majesty's Government for adoption. There can be no doubt whatever that the present enviable position of Great Britain on the Gold Coast as sole guardians of the sea-board, would not have been obtained without that very effective impulse given by the military operations of the Fanti Confederation, which, ready to be resumed at any time, made it impossible for the Dutch to remain, except at an annual cost which it did not suit them to incur. We accept this as a good augury. Success in first operations tends greatly to strengthen new institutions. The Fanti Confederation had a great success, and we believe that, by God's blessing, it will, under British guidance and with effective British support, show us also within a short time magnificent victories of peace—victories tending to avert war in the future, and to introduce a wide-spread happiness among populations which have been for ages past victims of the most deplorable calamities."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1872#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—Not very long ago I had occasion to observe that our relations with the Dutch Government and their subjects on this Coast were far from being on a satisfactory footing.

An import duty of 6 per cent. will, it is said, be levied from the period of effecting the exchange, at both Dutch and English ports, on rum and other spirits, tobacco, guns, and gunpowder, and of 2 per cent. on cloth and other goods. This is not all that we could have desired, but we suppose it is all that could be obtained. We think sixpence or even one shilling per gallon duty on rum and other spirits, with no duty on cloth and other goods (2 per cent. list), would have been much more to the interest of the countries on both sides of the Elmina line, while equally if not more productive of revenue. But it is so important that the Dutch should have thus acquiesced in and entered upon the system of import duties on the Gold Coast, that we are far from grumbling, especially as we indulge the hope that the results will prove so agreeable to the Dutch Chambers, in relieving Holland of a portion of the burthen of her African possessions which has long been complained of, as to insure their acquiescence in any increased scale of duties or modification of duties that may be found necessary for obtaining the revenue required for those works of civilization which are absolutely essential to material progress, and the total absence of which in countries that have been for so long a time partially under European rule and influence is a great disgrace to the European Powers concerned. We do not know what the French duties are at Assinee and Grand Bassam, &c., but we hope they will be made similar to those about to be levied at the Dutch and English ports. Except as regards Senegal, where the French expenditure has been heavy, there seems to have been a uniform determination on the part of European Governments not to expend home resources on West African possessions, and merely to hold them as commercial posts. Now this, if continued as hitherto, must prove fatal to African advancement. If the duties levied at these trading posts are only sufficient for, and are all absorbed by, the European officers there stationed, how is any internal or Coast improvement such as is required for the convenience, safety, and development of trade and commerce, and the consequent stimulus to production, ever to be effected? Even if the Africans themselves comprehended the necessity, how are they to provide for it? We will not go further into this all-important subject at present. The observations we have already made will show why we desire the imposition of duties that will give a large increase of revenue. If wealth is to be created in Africa (and there is no possible civilization without it), the appliances by which alone wealth can be created must be introduced. They cannot be self-generated among a people slowly emerging from the extremest depths of barbarism and social and moral degradation. More, they cannot even be imagined by them. We therefore congratulate our friends in the Protected Territories on the contemplated change, whenever it may take place. It will lead to a greatly-increased revenue at the British ports, and we do not see any necessity for a corresponding increase of expenses. As we understand and hope for the future, there will be an application of all the surplus revenue over and above what is at present raised to objects which will show that the British Government really desires to introduce and promote that civilization which so lessens the sufferings and evils to which the human family is exposed.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1867#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WHY ROADS &c., HAVE NOT BEEN MADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Taking into consideration all the circumstances connected with the mainland portion of the Gold Coast Colony, no one but an Englishman thoroughly acquainted with political and official life in Great Britain could, we imagine, understand how it should happen that so rich a possession, under the rule and government of a wealthy and powerful European nation could be left without any attempt to facilitate the development of its vast resources by the introduction of even the most rudimentary aids that civilization employs for like purposes. For us, of course, the reason of this neglect is not far to seek. It may be bad for a colony to belong to a very poor country; but it is sometimes almost as bad for it to belong to a very rich one, unless the inhabitants happen to be of themselves capable of working out their own advancement. The native Gold Coast people are not thus capable; and England has not hitherto realized the necessity of helping them. If she had held those countries, as she does now, a hundred years ago, and there had not then existed an accursed foreign Slave Trade, under which their inhabitants could be made profitable objects of purchase and sale, she might, perhaps, have set herself earnestly to work with the object of determining what might be made out of them. Had she done this, how different an aspect they would at this time have presented to that which they at present show. That she has not done it, is only according to her wont. She has not been accustomed to do it in her other colonies. These, settled for the most part by natives of the British Isles, have been left to their own resources, which they might safely be, because the settlers carried with them the arts and appliances of civilization, with capital by which to introduce and develop them in their new lands.

Although our connexion with it has been for a period approaching two and a-half centuries, so little notice has been given to it that it is in almost as undeveloped a state as when we first came into contact with its peoples. Perusal of the letters and articles from correspondents who recently accompanied the Ashanti expedition on its march from Cape Coast Castle to Coomassie brings forcibly to one\'s mind how sadly we have been lacking in our duty in this sphere. Rich almost beyond compare in mineral and vegetable products, this field of wealth has been permitted to remain all but uncultivated. No strenuous efforts appear to have been made to open up the country; there are no roads to speak of, there are no facilities for inland transport—even at this day every gallon of palm oil, every hundredweight of rubber, every fathom of cloth, and every pound of gunpowder has to be carried on men\'s heads to and from the interior, and this in a land abounding in auriferous metal. One naturally asks—Why should this be so? The answer is not far to seek. There are several causes which account for the backwardness of the Colony, the main being the reputed unhealthiness of the climate. On this point there cannot be any doubt as to its not being favourable to Europeans, especially if they come here with constitutions in any way enervated by previous excesses, or if they indulge in excesses of any kind while here. It is imprudent for a white man to come to West Africa unless his constitution is perfectly sound and every organ in his body unimpaired; but if he is in perfect health, and will exercise ordinary care, take good food, live regularly, practice sobriety, work hard when he is at it, and will not (to use a vulgarism) funk when he has a touch of fever, he will run no greater risk on the Gold Coast than in other tropical countries. There are many Europeans known to the writer who have been in this country eight, ten, fifteen, twenty-five, and thirty years and more, with periodical visits home, and who in the majority of cases have remained in the Colony three, five, and seven years at a stretch; yet in none of these instances were the parties total abstainers, but they were temperate in all things and enjoyed perfect health. Yet these men lived in times when less attention was bestowed to sanitary matters. With ordinary care the healthy European runs no risk. Now the authorities are becoming alive to the necessities of better sanitation, and some efforts are being made to improve the sanitary condition of the principal sea-coast towns. That the country has suffered in no inconsiderable degree by its reputation for unhealthiness is evidenced by this passage which I cite from an official source: ""Against the development of the Colony by means of English capital there lies upon it the stigma of a baneful climate. But I cannot help thinking that by clearing the waterways of the Colony and thus improving the drainage of the country, by converting the bush tracks into decent roads and so improving the ventilation of the country, by a gradual conversion of the dense bush into cultivated areas, by the enforcement in the interior towns and villages of the sanitary laws which have proved so useful and advantageous in the coast towns, and by improving the means of transport, thereby enabling Europeans resident at a distance from the trade ports to have ready access to good food and the various comforts of civilisation to which they have been accustomed, and which they more than ever want in a tropical country—the climate of the Gold Coast will lose its notoriety, and the country will become, equally with other tropical countries, a safe means for the investment of capital."" But beside the climate the greatest hindrance to the rapid development of the country and its trade has been the want of proper means of transport. So long as the primitive method of carrying everything on the head prevails, the amount of trade must necessarily be narrowed still the volume of trade for 1894 shows an increase roughly of 13 per cent. over 1893 with the United Kingdom, and of 22 per cent. with foreign countries, being respectively £1,190,532 1s. 3d. against £1,054,386 17s. 6d., and £429,708 1s. 4d. and £350,387 3s. 5d. This gives one some idea of what the increase is certain to be when the produce-yielding districts of the colony are tapped by good roads and the ""iron horse."" The Government, it is said, are organising a roads department, and surveys have been made for railroads, none too soon, for they are indispensable in a country where cattle (including in that category horses, mules, and donkeys) will live only in certain localities. Irrespective of the necessity for roads and railways for produce, the same facilities for access to the gold mining districts cannot be lost sight of; it is the yellow metal which has given its name to the colony. Since the fifteenth century it is estimated that six or seven millions of gold have been exported from the goldfields. Anterior to the discovery of Australian or Californian gold the principal supply of the auriferous metal was obtained from the West Coast, in particular from this land. Whoever has travelled over the country has been struck with indications of the precious metal almost everywhere. It outcrops in reefs, it is discovered in sand, and found in the beds of its rivers; you will see it being washed for in the streets. Why, then, has not the country become a great gold mining centre? I doubt very much whether California itself ever presented to the naked eye the tempting wealth of gold which so forcibly attracts the attention of the traveller in the western districts of the Gold Coast. With plenty of capital for the developments of its properties and under European and native control, any enterprise for the development of the gold industry in this colony ought to be a substantial success.—*Liverpool Journal of Commerce.*', 'last_edit_date': '1896-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1896#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The opening up of the forest country appears at present almost a hopeless task. The air is so damp that it is impossible to make clearings by burning the undergrowth, while the trees are so close, and the natives are by nature so indolent, that nothing in the way of pioneer work can be expected from native enterprise. So long as they have enough to eat, the coast and forest tribes will do nothing unless forced by the more vigorous white man. Doubtless, gold exists in abundance in this forest land, but speculators must remember that it is a very different matter prospecting for gold here as compared with the open, healthy veldt of South Africa and the thinly wooded plains of West Australia. No European could do manual labour on the West Coast and live, and even as overseers the death rate would be very high, for it is well known that where ground in the forest is disturbed, the malaria arising from it increases in deadliness. Therefore the Gold Coast cannot, under present conditions, be considered a promising region for the investor in gold or any other mines. For the same reason we must be prepared to lose some valuable lives before the projected railway is completed.\n\nIt is often remarked with astonishment, that though the British have been in possession of the Gold Coast for over two hundred years, yet our trade there has made little real progress, in striking contrast to what our race has accomplished in other parts of the world. The causes are not far to seek. The coast Natives have neither the energy nor the aptitude for trade of the Natives of India, and the only possible means of transport is the Native carrier. The country for many miles from the coast is unfitted for a white man. Hemmed in by a broad fever-laden mass of almost impenetrable forest, inhabited by more or less hostile tribes, it is little surprising that our trading stations have never left the coast line. After a short period of office, Government officials are removed to more salubrious climes, should they be lucky enough to retain their health; civilians, if they do not die, return home periodically to recruit their fever-stricken frames. Thus there is a constant stream of new officials and traders\' agents, who, before they can master the conditions of the country and carry out steps to improve the trade, are succeeded by others, and there is no continuity of policy. The only remedy for this state of affairs—and it is an expensive one—seems to be for every official and trading agent to have an ""understudy,"" ready to carry on the work without interruption when his principal leaves or is incapacitated.

The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': 'In the 1870s, free trade was the slogan by which Europeans fought against the right of African rulers to regulate trade.$^{23}$ In the name of free trade, they sought more and more privileges for European traders.

They manipulated servicing of the loans to acquire rights to the produce and to customs duties years in advance.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New patterns of European intervention in the Maghrib', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Morocco and Algeria each tried to defend its own position, which led to a subsequent deterioration of their relations with the maritime powers.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure.

Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

In the first place, the circumstances and conditions of Great Britain and France are essentially different; and, in the second, Great Britain differs in its occupations and annexations of foreign barbarous countries, from all other civilized powers. Since the erring and disastrous attempt to tax the people of her then North American colonies, for the benefit of the mother country, Great Britain has never sought to derive revenue for the Imperial exchequer from any of her beyond sea possessions. Until she adopted and put into universal practice in her colonies and possessions (such as had not legislatures of their own) of the principles of free trade, every acquisition of territory in West Africa, or Fiji, or New Guinea, or elsewhere, is an occupation by her for the benefit and advantage of the manufacturers and commercial people of every other state and power. She holds and administers for the general benefit of the people whom she and her subjects are seeking to civilize, and of the world at large. Not from any one of her Colonies or possessions does she draw one farthing of revenue into and for the benefit of the Imperial exchequer. But France, if she takes possession of territory, establishes therein her exclusive system. She takes possession for the benefit of French manufacturing industry, and shipping, and commerce, to the exclusion of all other. Let her open the ports of her Colonies and possessions to the British flag and to British commerce, as Great Britain opens hers to the French flag and to French commerce, and no one would hail with more pleasure than we should do her ""occupation,"" however extensive, of the uncivilized portions of the habitable world. But even then she should do what is worthy of a great nation, and not make little, unworthy, pettifogging attacks upon the tranquillity of semi-civilized people. We had intended in this number of our journal to have entered at large upon this subject, in consequence of her recent action at Black Point, Porto Novo, and Bonny. But ""the unexpected,"" which so often frustrates the carrying out of human intentions, prevents our doing so; and we are compelled to content ourselves with blaming anew the British Government for its culpable indifference to the welfare of Lagos, in turning a deaf ear to all the entreaties of which the friends of Lagos have been prodigal, that possession should be taken of Porto Novo, and the barbarous cruelties of its abominable rulers be put an end to by the enforcement of British Law. We feel this very much. We were partly influential in obtaining the occupation and annexation of Lagos; and we always urged that its Government should be made to embrace Porto Novo. We were opposed in this by the old influence that made of Whydah a depôt for free African labourers for the French plantations, as a substitute for the suppressed African Slave Trade. We had hoped that influence had abandoned the Lagos Waters, and was now operating only on the East of Africa and in Madagascar.

The writer criticises somewhat severely, though in a friendly tone, the policy pursued by France towards its colonial possessions in general, and those in Africa in particular. This, with the frequent changes in policy natural to a Government which is always being changed, has ""prevented them from attaining the prosperity at which they might otherwise have arrived."" As for England, her policy is described as prevailing not only in the ten colonies which she owns in the continent, but almost everywhere throughout the central and equatorial parts of it. The Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and German possessions are then mentioned, and a claim is put in on behalf of Belgium, not, indeed to actual territorial possession, but to a number of commercial settlements owning some local property. It is, as the Belgians assert, their legitimate boast that, on the initiative of King Leopold II, they opened the Congo to the navigation of the world. It is, therefore, with this part of Africa that they have the most to do. They have established a joint-stock company, called the ""Belgian Company of African Commerce,"" which was incorporated in March, 1882, with a capital of 10,000l. Of this sum about 2,000l. was spent in the purchase of the vessel Akassa, which is, no doubt, destined to do wonders on the Congo river. It is intended to increase the company till it has a capital of 600,000 francs, and ultimately two or even five millions of francs. At present it seems that the subscribers to it are chiefly English. But it is necessary to avoid confusing the company with the two others also having French names, that is, the International African Association and the Comité des Etudes du Haut Congo.'}, {'id': 4724, 'article_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-20', 'issue_date': '01_11_1883', 'content': 'If the old ""Quem vult perdere,"" which applied equally to nations as to individuals, had not been so hackneyed, we should undoubtedly have chosen it as a fitting introduction to what we feel bound to write as regards the late, and present external action of the French Government, which seems to us to have placed France upon the slippery plank at the bottom of which lies disaster, if not ruin. It would be impossible, we think, for even the most unreasoning admirer of France, its people, and its Government, to find cause for eulogy in the late external action of the Paris cabinet. With Annam and Tonquin we have nothing to do, though we may have formed our opinions on the subject. As regards Madagascar, we consider the French action, prompted by the Réunion planters, as so certain to lead, if successful, to a new revival of the African slave trade, either open or under the pretence of apprenticeship, or free labour contracts, that, as such, and as a wanton aggression on a community of the African race that has been for some time steadily progressing on the road to civilization, we do not hesitate to give it our most emphatic condemnation. The Government of Liberia, like that of Madagascar, refuses to allow white men to obtain a settlement on any portion of its land by purchase; and although this has greatly interfered with the development of the resources of the country, by shutting out European capital and energy, we can find quite enough in the history of past relations of Europeans with the people of Africa to excuse this policy of isolation. Behind every European acquiring, by purchase, landed possessions in such a country, there looms the national government of that European in the distance, as almost certain to become a factor in any dispute that might arise between him and the authorities. With equal justice, therefore, might France make demands upon Liberia, as upon Madagascar, on the ground of refusal to allow French subjects to become freeholders. What most concerns us, however, as regards the present external action of the French Government, is that portion of it which embraces west and south-west Africa in its disturbing course. We have before alluded to and condemned (and it will bear repetition) the most unfriendly action of France in taking the wretched King Tofa, of Porto Novo, under its protection. We repeat, situate as Porto Novo is with regard to Lagos, together with the non-existence of any real French interest there, the acceptance of a Protectorate by France was about as offensively unfriendly an action as can well be conceived. The French mercantile house that counselled it, has performed about as questionable service to France as was performed by the Portuguese slave trader who led the French Government into a similar measure some twenty years ago. No good can come of it to France, and much evil may. We and all other advocates of the rights of humanity, must now hold her responsible for all the horrors it may please her atrocious protege, King Tofa, to commit. We have a right to demand, in the interests of humanity and civilization, that the French Protectorate of Porto Novo shall be characterized and justified by the absolute repression of those fearful customs in which it has pleased King Tofa and his predecessors to indulge. Such repression has characterized the action of Great Britain in West Africa, and the way in which she has thus exercised her power for freeing the poor wretched victims of tyranny and superstition constitute, in our mind, her only just claim to rule there. Her keeping peace among the natives, and suppressing all slavery and slave trade, so far as within her power; affording protection to trade and commerce, and laying the foundation of civilization on which the natives may hereafter build—these, we say, and to afford protection for philanthropic and missionary enterprise, are her raison d\'etre, on the West Coast. There is no doubt—there can be no doubt—that she might do this work better than she does, if more enlightened councils prevailed in Downing Street; still, what she has done, has been greatly instrumental for good. To feel this fully we have only to imagine what the West Coast of Africa would have been without persistent British interference and guardianship there. And it must always be borne in mind that the imperial exchequer does not receive one farthing from her settlements and possessions, and the protected trade there; while under her liberal free trade system, the ships, subjects, and goods of every other civilized power, European or American, have the same advantages as her own. In a word, she keeps the greater portion of West Africa open to trade and commerce for the benefit of the whole world. Now, the French Colonial system is the very reverse of this. Her protective and prohibitive regulations are in full force at Goree and Senegal; and, by intelligence lately received, we can have no doubt that France is anxious to confer similar benefits on other portions of the West Coast. The French admiral who took Porto Novo under French protection, looked in upon other places on his way down the coast. He made overtures to the King of Bonny, which the king and chief, who have received education in England, were too wise to listen to. And now we learn further that he has proposed to establish a French factory at Old Calabar, and that King Duke Ephraim IX., whose coronation under the auspices of the British consul and the Rev. W. Anderson, we some time since gave an account of, has held a grand council and petitioned the French Government to induce French traders to settle there. Those who do not know anything of the West Coast would suppose from this that French traders were hitherto denied trade with Old Calabar; which, under British consular auspices, has been open for trade to all the world from the period at which Great Britain put a final end to the slave trade there. The intended process is clear. A French factory under Government auspices, perhaps managed by Messrs. Regis, of Marseilles, Lagos, and Porto Novo, who have manipulated the Porto Novo protectorate—a dispute with the natives—French Government demands redress—protection—occupation—a French exclusive trading station, to the exclusion of our Liverpool and German merchants, who now do the great oil trade there.'}, {'id': 4879, 'article_title': 'GERMAN COLONIZATION IN AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'GERMAN COLONIZATION IN AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': '07-01-1884', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-22', 'issue_date': '01_07_1884', 'content': 'have any real right to Angra Pequeña, there is no reason why we should not assert it; but at most, it does not extend beyond one or two of the islands in the bay.

If Germany wishes to acquire colonies in Africa or elsewhere, it is, we think, our interest to encourage her in her enterprise. Germany, next to Great Britain and France, is the greatest trading nation in Europe, and her trade in recent years has been extending with marvellous rapidity. In this respect she is no doubt a competitor with us; but her competition is robust and healthy, and can do us no real harm. So far as we can see, nothing but good could result from having her as a neighbour in South Africa; her traders and colonists would set themselves energetically to develop the resources of a continent that needs nothing more than earnest workers. The one chief objection to French colonization is that it paralyses the unrestricted development of every region to which it spreads, and hence the desirability of preventing France obtaining an exclusive hold over such an important artery of trade as the Congo. If we can judge from the example of Angra Pequeña, the Germans are more likely to follow the English method of colonization than the French.

The French were then desirous of consolidating their possessions, and for long after our refusal to treat for the exchange the work of exploration by De Brazza starved.\n\nThis exploration has led to the addition to the colony of the Gaboon of the countries between it and the Congo, which may soon offer an important field for trade, and probably contain a trade route to the equatorial and northern portion of the Congo, which will compete with that of Mr. Stanley. Our commercial relations with France since the abrogation of the Cobden Treaty have been such that we have been unable to safeguard the interests of our merchants in French possessions beyond the seas, but perhaps nowhere except in the Gaboon have English ships been forced to haul down the English ensign and hoist the tricolour before being allowed to trade in certain territorial waters! The French in the Gaboon have acted on a principle of exclusion, and though a portion of the territory is bound by the Free-trade rules, we may feel certain that the English merchant, though he may legally stand on an equal footing with the French trader, will find that his position is very different, and that many obstacles are put in the way of his competing on equal terms with his rivals. The Congo is now the scene of one of the greatest experiments that has ever been tried in international law. The establishment of trade and the opening of communications cannot be brought about in a few months, and if some of the utopian descriptions we have heard of the thousands and millions of yards of calico which the teeming multitudes of Central Africa will require are to be taken as the basis of calculation in estimating the future trade of these districts, those who accept will be doomed to disappointment.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""This consideration having been stated, it may be well to turn to the other class, the conduct of other nations in West Africa.

Duties are levied for the maintenance of her establishment, which the traders had not coveted, and is harassing and destructive of commerce. Only on the points of land actually occupied has she any authority whatever. The natives are hostile, and wherever French authority can be exercised, the chiefs have been reduced to helpless poverty. Does a trader wish to establish commercial relations with a coast tribe on French territory 100 miles from Gaboon? He has to pay the same duties as in Gaboon; but if any dispute arise with the natives he gets no protection. Those parts have flourished most where the natives' ideas were studied, and the traders' actions regulated accordingly, where the delusion has not taken root that trade can flourish while the native villages are burning, and chains put on the customers. In the Gaboon and Ojowé rivers, all craft are required to fly the French flag, except ocean-going vessels. Hence have resulted attacks on English vessels by the natives under the impression that they belonged to the French Government! The American Protestant Mission were forbidden to teach the children English; French only would be tolerated. In Loango the chiefs were ordered to contribute a certain number of men, to be shipped to Gaboon and drilled as soldiers. The young men failed to present themselves, and so the French authorities refuse to allow youths to leave the country, though work elsewhere is plentiful.

The article in question says:—\n\nOne of the ways in which the development of trade must be carried out is by pushing factories up beyond the tribes who now serve as middlemen between the European trader and the native producer. Some difficulty will no doubt be encountered in passing through the unhealthy and malarious districts in which these middlemen live, but the improved knowledge we are obtaining of how to combat climatic diseases will render such an enterprise more easy than it would have been twenty years ago. Indeed, if we contrast the early reports of the Niger with its present exploitation, we may believe that the climate of no tropical country will permanently prevent its being opened up to commerce. This is a ray of hope for our African traders, and it is to be hoped that our Government will enable them to avail themselves of it speedily, and not allow them to be forestalled by the merchants of other nations. As if the inaction of our Government had not been sufficiently disastrous to the trade of the African merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, the home legislation of the last few years has also done much to hamper their enterprise. One industry alone, which, though it may be considered a small one, came in the aggregate to a considerable amount, has been completely driven out of the country. The trade in matches to the West Coast used to be supplied by Manchester. Now, the children who used to be employed in their manufacture are sent to school hungry, while German matches are sent in German ships to those who used to buy the English ones, and the only profit to English people is that of the middleman, and even that is being rapidly taken from them.\n\nThe German and French textile manufactures are also running us close, and we have to watch carefully the change of fashions and ideas among the natives. Many cheap articles made in France, with a ready sale on the coast, could easily be made in England. Some of the native manufactures could easily be imitated, such as the Niger cloths and the silk and cotton cloths made by the Santees and Ashantees of unravelled European stuffs.

The French had induced several of the native chiefs to sign an agreement for a French protectorate, and they were now endeavouring to induce the King to do the same by a promise of £3,000. It was of the utmost importance, therefore, to British trade that some steps should be taken to prevent the French from getting this treaty ratified, and to prevent any European Power who, like the French and Germans, had taken small strips of land on the borders of Lagos, from interfering with the commerce and duties of the colony.\n\nMr. Barker (Secretary) read correspondence from natives and agents at Lagos on the subject. It appeared that Abeokuta is a large and populous place in the kingdom of Agbas, and the seat of the Government emporium of trade from the interior. Since 1843 the English had been in the place, and had taught the natives many useful employments. The English merchants and missionaries established the present trade in palm oil and kernels to counteract the Transatlantic slave trade. The place had lately been visited by a French officer disguised as a trader, and he had concluded arrangements with several native chiefs to divert the trade to Porto Novo, which was under the protection of France, and to close the roads to Lagos. If the revenue of the latter place, which was really only a sandy island, fell off, the Government would be compelled to abandon it.\n\nThe Chairman said that it appeared to him that the object of the French was to get behind the English all the way along the coast. He thought it would be a good thing either to pass a resolution authorizing Mr. Barker to write to the Government on the subject, or to arrange for a deputation to go to London.\n\nMr. C. J. Morris said that the French were developing their trade very rapidly on the coast.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position.

These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed. A large portion of the trade was doubtless in slaves, but still that alone could never have accounted for the prosperity and wealth of the merchants who traded with Western Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West African Trade and the Government', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Mr. J. F. Hutton, President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, in his address at the annual meeting of the Chamber on Feb. 1, said that a matter which had engaged the attention of the directors was our trade with West Africa, particularly in the neighbourhood of the rivers Niger and Binue. They had to complain very much of the apathy manifested by the resident officials of Her Majesty's Government, who taxed the goods, but declined to afford any protection or assistance to British merchants. Those officials seemed to have an idea that they were sent out to rule and not to assist as much as possible in the development of British trade. Owing to the state of affairs which had been allowed to arise in the localities indicated, the trade in this country had suffered a very marked decline, for whereas in 1884 we sent 106,000,000 yards of cotton goods, representing a value of £1,320,000, we only sent last year 73,000,000 yards, or a money value of £851,000. He submitted that the Government ought to take prompt measures to protect the lives and property of British subjects in West Africa, and so assist in extending a very valuable market for English manufactures. They had just heard that last May, on the invitation of the German Government, Her Majesty's Government gave to Germany an assurance that a Congo International Conference should be pledged to the British Protectorate in the Niger, that only moderate duties should be levied, and that those should only be levied for the purpose of paying the expenses necessary to carry out the obligations of the Protectorate. At the same time it was understood that there should be no monopolies there, and those concessions were made without giving those who were really owners of property in the territories any voice in the country whatever. Two of the special objects of the merchants in obtaining these concessions from the natives and in obtaining the treaties of sovereignty and territory were that we should do the very utmost we could to stop the importation of spirits into the districts. That trade had increased very considerably during the last few years, and it was one of the curses which European countries were introducing into uncivilized countries, and would tend to retard the progress of our trade and the progress of civilization in the interior of Africa. He thought it was a discredit almost to the Powers of Europe that when great and earnest endeavours were made to limit the import of spirits into these places, there was an almost unanimous opinion expressed against it except by England.

These outrages have been brought to the notice of the French authorities at Gaboon, but it seems they have shown great apathy in dealing with the subject; indeed, it is alleged that the Commandant has informed the traders that their property and they themselves would not be molested if they dealt fairly with the natives. In proof of this, the Commandant himself went up the river in a boat unarmed. He had not gone far, however, before he was fired at by the natives from the shore. Fortunately, he escaped unhurt, though one bullet passed through the sleeve of his coat. Subsequently, a French gunboat was sent up the river to inquire into the matter. On the approach of the vessel some natives came off to her with fruit, which they wished to sell. It is stated that the crew then attempted to arrest the natives, who numbered about forty. Becoming alarmed, most of the natives jumped over the ship's side into the water, and it is alleged that whilst striking out for the shore most of them were shot down by the crew of the gunboat. Two men who were arrested on the deck of the vessel were afterwards hanged from the yard-arm. The gunboat then returned to Gaboon, and the circumstance was reported. The Commandant, however, is stated to have disapproved of thus summarily dealing with the natives, and looked upon the matter as an outrage on French subjects. He has therefore, it is stated, placed the commander of the vessel under arrest. It is further stated that the French authorities had told the traders they must protect their own interests, but the prohibition of arms into Gaboon prevents them having the means of even their own defence. The British Consul of Loanda, Mr. Cohen, was at Gaboon when the despatch left, making inquiries into the alleged undue treatment of British merchants at Gaboon. From Sette Cama news was received that the French had annexed Ngove, and the English traders and natives of Sette Cama were afraid that the French would also take their town. Both Ngove and Sette Cama are independent places, and the trade is carried on exclusively by British merchants. Ngove is the next port further south from Gaboon, and Sette Cama adjoins Ngove still further south. All along Cape St. Catherine has been looked upon as the recognized boundary of the French possession of Gaboon. A petition, it is said, has been forwarded to Mr. Cohen by the inhabitants of Sette Cama, informing him of what has taken place, and expressing their anxiety for their own town.

The process of land alienation and its political and economic repercussions in Kenya and Southern Rhodesia have been well documented by M. P. K. Sorrenson 3 and Giovanni Arrighi.$^{4}$ It has been argued that British perception of economic activity in Kenya at the beginning of the twentieth century led them to look for economic agents from outside. Contrary to welldeveloped peasant agriculture found in Uganda (especially in Buganda) under the control of centralized political institutions, the argument goes, the economies of most communities in Kenya were too backward to be relied upon as a springboard for economic growth. Consequently, the argument concludes, white settlers were chosen to form the base of economic life of the dependency.$^{5}$ This line of thought offers only part, and the lesser part, of the explanation. There were many parts of the British Empire where indigenous economies were miserably undeveloped. The coastal regions of Kenya are a case in point. The fact that these regions were spared from settler colonization clearly indicates that the Kenya Highlands had something special to offer for European settlement. Evidently it was the temperate climate above other factors, which attracted the white settlers. The land occupied by settlers was mostly over 1400 m above sea level. Such areas were among those with the highest and most reliable levels of precipitation. In short, the alienated land was situated in the most favourable agricultural zones.\nThe beginning of land alienation in East Africa was discussed in Chapter 7. It took a dramatic trend especially in Kenya after 1909 and was carried out at give-away prices. In 1903 only about 2000 ha had been alienated to Europeans in Kenya. By 1914 the area alienated had risen to about 260000 ha and to about 2740000 ha in 1930.$^{6}$ This was a very substantial chunk of the arable land, bearing in mind the fact that the Kenya Highlands (about 90000 sq km) comprised less than 15% of Kenya's area and yet supported over 75% of the total population of the country until the 1930s.

Africans whose land was alienated were forced to move, at times with some compensation. By 1921, 714 out of a total European population of 3634 were engaged in agriculture.$^{16}$ During the mid-i930s land in Northern Rhodesia was divided roughly into three categories. Areas reserved especially for Africans totalled 28740000 ha and comprised Barotseland (14970000 ha) and the Native Reserves (13760000 ha). Land already allocated to Europeans was more than 3430000 ha, of which 2225000 ha were held by two companies and more than 1200000 ha in farms. The remaining 60700000 ha comprised forest and game reserves. 17 In British West Africa (see Fig. 16.2), the British attempted even earlier than in East Africa to establish direct control over land, to create forest reserves and to offer land as concessions to European planters and con› cessionaires. As early as 1894, and again in 1897 the British introduced a Lands Bill in the Gold Coast which was to establish direct British control over lands which were said to be vacant. The reaction of the people, as has been pointed out already in Chapter 6, was the formation of the Aborigines\' Rights Protection Society in Cape Coast in 1897 by the educated elite and the traditional rulers to resist this proposed legislation. The Society sent a delegation to London in May 1898 which succeeded in persuading the Colonial Office to drop the Bill on the grounds that there were no vacant lands in the Gold Coast and that every piece of land was owned by one extended family or another. A move to introduce a similar Bill in Lagos in Nigeria in the 1910s was also checkmated by the AntiSlavery and Aborigines\' Rights Protection Society founded by the elite led by Herbert Macaulay and the traditional rulers. This Society did this by appealing to the Privy Council in London which ruled that land was the \'undisputed right of the community\'.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': 'The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals. With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock. First, it did not involve any fundamental technological innovation. Second, many of these crops or similar ones had been grown and processed long before the colonial era.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': 'On the eastern side of the continent, the Indian Ocean trade was not exclusively directed towards European countries, nor was the long-distance trade out of East Africa controlled by Europeans or Afro-Europeans. The colonizers had to supplant the Arab, Swahili and Indian merchants. Experiences in East Africa underscored the premise that colonial activities first centred around parts of Africa which had a prior involvement in inter› continental exchange. The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region. By the mid 1880s, the Scramble was already taking place on Lake Victoria, on whose shores colonial enterprises were quickly grafted on to the already high level of African economic activity. When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form. North African economies were as much part of a Mediterranean complex as they were part of the African trans-Saharan network. Prior experience with the European economy allowed segments of North African society to accommodate to the intensifi› cation of production for Europe and to the spread of European commodities in local markets. But the well-defined and exploitative ruling class was determined to defend state frontiers, even if willing to enter closer economic relations with Europeans. Therefore, colonial rule often advanced while maintaining North Africans in nominal authority, and the colonial economy was institutionalized before the complete subjugation of the indigenous polities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

Indeed, the most fundamental and dramatic - though tragic - of these changes took place in the much shorter period from 1890 to 1910, the period that saw the conquest and occupation of virtually the whole continent of Africa by the imperial powers and the establishment of the colonial system. The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system. The pace of this drama was truly astonishing, for as late as 1880 only very limited areas of Africa had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In the whole of West Africa, only the island and coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Freetown and its environs (now in Sierra Leone), the southern parts of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the coastal areas of Abidjan in Ivory Coast and Porto Novo in Dahomey (now Benin) and the island of Lagos (in what is now Nigeria) had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In North Africa, it was only Algeria that had by 1880 been colonized by the French. Not an inch of the whole of East Africa had come under the control of any European power, while only the coastal stretches of Mozambique and Angola of the whole of Central Africa were being ruled by the Portuguese. It was only in Southern Africa that foreign rule had not only been firmly implanted but had even been extended a considerable distance inland (see Fig. 1.1). In short, by as late as 1880, about as much as 80% of the continent of Africa was being ruled by her own kings, queens, clan and lineage heads, in empires, kingdoms, communities and polities of various sizes and shapes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The area with which we are concerned is broadly bounded by the Atlantic coast on the west, Lake Tanganyika and the Nile-Zaire ridge on the east, the Ubangui savannas on the north, and the plateau separating the Zaire and Zambezi basins to the south. The period we shall deal with cannot be limited to a single theme. Contrary to the common belief, the history of the years 1800-80 is not a matter only or mainly of long-distance trade and links with the outside world (the economy of Central African communities at this period was still based more on production than on trade). Nor can the precolonial nineteenth century be regarded as an era of widespread violence, because of the slave trade, civil strife, etc.: the commonplace belief that Africa was racked by incessant 'tribal warfare' overlooks the basic fact that the bulk of the peoples in the area led peaceful lives as producers, steadily improving their farming methods, bettering their environment and exporting the produce of food-gathering. Finally, the history of the nineteenth century is not to be reduced to purely political history concerned with despotic kingdoms and states: if there is a political feature common to the Central African communities of the period around 1800, it is more likely to be the much disputed quest for equilibrium and accommodation between powers derived from different sources.\nAn historical account of nineteenth-century Central Africa must in fact satisfy several requirements. It must describe the ordinary life and aspirations of the societies in this enormous area at the time. This would bring out the continuity between the 1800s and the more distant past: the changes, although noticeable, were slow.\nAt the same time, the history of Central Africa in the nineteenth century is characterized by breaks with the past. After all, in the years 1800-80 the area was more a part of the world trading network than ever before. The impact of the world economic situation, or of some specific sectors of it, was making itself felt: in some areas it influenced social and political history, giving a noticeable impetus to trade and offering new opportunities for stockpiling, while in others it restricted the process. The beginnings of a European grip on the profits of the trading economy in the interior of Central Africa were already evident."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Viewed from a somewhat different perspective, the unequal value of commodities exchanged reflects the fragile position of the region within the larger international trading system. As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""This effort at self-development was perhaps most prominent in the realm of political structures and state power. The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 340, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '04-11-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_05_1864', 'content': 'Sir,—I have only a few words to write to-day.

The answer given was, that the rules of the law of nations had been looked upon as the special privilege of Christian races; and it was only in 1856 the Porte, by the Treaty of Paris, was permitted to participate in the advantages of international law and of the European concert. Therefore his opinion is that it was obligatory on these nations that they should recognize these laws, and they could not allow those nations to participate in its advantages who did not recognize this law as obligatory upon themselves. Publicists and moralists taught that Christian sovereigns should conduct themselves honestly, and observe the rules and justice of equity and Christian morality. Feeble, half-savage races, deprived as yet of the benefits of civilization, are now no longer considered merely as prey for the rapacity of civilized nations, or as furnishing a field for their enterprise. But what are the conditions under which a State can be capable of negotiating treaties? According to Klüber, a certain number of men and families congregating together, and fixing their abode in a country, associating themselves and submitting to a common chief with the purpose of insuring the safety of all, form a State. Sovereignty is acquired by a State at the time of its formation, or when it frees itself from a condition of dependence. Therefore, only territories without masters, that is, those in which no sovereign power is as yet established, can be rightfully available for occupation.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Deputation to Lord Knutsford', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""As regards the colony of Gambia, it was but natural that British traders would object to give their colony and trade to France for what the French possessed between Pongas river and the Gaboon, as the French had only the Assinie and Porto Novo territory, both of little value.

The real ruler of this place is an Englishman who has lived there for twenty years, and holds deeds of ownership of the land.

They refused, and when the matter was again brought up by the recent deputation they were told that the territory had been taken over by France.\n\n""Something of the same kind took place as regards the island of Matacong.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

The memorial pointed out that the occupations by France and the late annexations by Germany of small portions of the West Coast of Africa tended to break the continuity of the British protectorate, and to bring about a greater conflict of national interests. The influence of the British authorities with the natives was lessened, and the introduction of different principles of trading seriously affected the prosperity of British trades. The duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnished the greater portion of the Government revenues. In German and French settlements these articles were free from duty, and being to a great extent sold in the same markets as the British goods, competition became so keen that the loss to British revenue and trade must ultimately be very great. The Committee recommended that the Chamber should ask the Foreign Office that while negotiations regarding African territories were pending, something might be done, by exchange or otherwise, to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from the ports where British trade had become established, and where rivalry upon different commercial and political principles was so injurious. The Government might also take into consideration the extension of the British protectorate to the unoccupied portions of the coast alluded to. It was moved that the Chamber should forward to the Foreign Office a memorial on the lines of that submitted by the African Trade Section. This resolution was unanimously agreed to. At the same meeting a letter was read which had been received from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, asking the Liverpool Chamber to join in a petition to Lord Granville respecting the claims of Portugal on the Congo.

The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district. The ""customs"" have been abolished, a uniform export duty of 2s. 6d. per ton being levied instead. As things stand, we make no pretence to the sovereignty of the country; we only constitute ourselves the final authority in matters of dispute between the natives and traders of whatever nationality, and debar our continental neighbours from proclaiming themselves masters of the country. Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa. In Italy, too, the same law of national life is operating; but up to the present Italy\'s colonial enterprises have not been characterised by a striking measure of success.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Trading Troubles in Western Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'To a palaver on board his gunboat all the chiefs were recently summoned by the English Consul, who said he regretted deeply to see the state into which the country had fallen, the want of unity that existed amongst the chiefs and people, and the general lawlessness that prevailed. He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Conference', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the sitting of the Conference Committee on the 24th, a definition of the Congo basin was agreed upon, which is virtually the commercial definition of Mr. Stanley.

As for the eastern littoral, the free-trade basin includes all lakes and eastward-flowing rivers affected by the Congo commerce, without prejudice to the existence of sovereign rights on the eastern coast, especially those of Portugal and the Sultan of Zanzibar.

It is calculated that one man can work an acre of land which should produce about 300 bushels, worth about 30l.\n\nThe trade is comparatively of recent origin, having only commenced in 1845, in which year the value of the export was but 199l.; in 1858, it had reached 188,000l.; of late years, owing principally to the war amongst the native tribes, it has somewhat fallen off, and in 1864 the value of the crop was only 78,000l. The greater part of these nuts, probably three-fourths, are exported to France, where they are converted into an oil which is sold as olive oil, and is largely used for domestic purposes.\n\nThe recent falling off in the ground-nut crop has led the merchants to direct their attention to cotton, and steps are being taken to induce the natives to adopt its cultivation, fifteen tons and a half having been exported in 1864.\n\nThe policy of this measure appears doubtful: there is no diminution in the demand for ground-nuts, nor any reason to suppose that they will cease to be in request, so long as oil continues so extensively an article of continental consumption; it is difficult to prevail on the natives to change their habits or customs, and, even if successful in the present instance, it must be a long time before the cotton crop can rival in value even the ground-nut crop of the past year. It is also to be feared that the cultivation of cotton, requiring attention during a considerable portion of the year, and being necessarily carried on in the same spot, will be unsuited to the habits of the wandering tribes engaged in growing the ground-nut, a cultivation which only requires their absence from home during four months of the year, and which they can carry on wherever they please on paying a percentage for the use of the land.\n\nMoreover, a cotton plantation is liable to destruction at any time when war may break out in its neighbourhood, whilst ground-nuts are exposed to this very common danger during only one-third of the year.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo and the Conference in Reference to Commercial Geography', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The first subject was the declaration that the rights of free trade should be exercised in this basin brought under the Berlin Conference.

Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power. Such trade as is done with it is purely British, and is chiefly with the town of Bristol. Its inhabitants are allied to the Kru races of Liberia.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}]",True

In contrast, The African Times articles offer specific details about the obstacles faced by merchants in Lagos, who were unable to trade directly with Ibadan due to road closures by the Egba and Ijebu tribes. These closures were partly due to jealousy and unfriendly feelings towards European settlers and ongoing conflicts with the Ibadan tribe. The articles also highlight fraudulent practices and monopolistic control by the Egbas and Ijebus, which led to disputes and threatened regional trade.

The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance. Hopkins warns us not to imagine that Niger delta traders like Nana Olomu were forerunners of nationalism or spokesmen for popular griev› ances, pointing out that their 'vision of social justice did not include the emancipation of their own slaves'. Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation', 'content': ""Amin identifies three important resistances of this kind - the wars of 1673 to 1677; the Torodo revolution of 1776, which 'overthrew the military aristocracy and ended the slave trade'; and the movement of the prophet Diile in 1830 in the kingdom of Waalo, which failed 'in the face of French military intervention'. Amin is here describing resistances which were directed against an African aristocracy, but which were also a response to French economic aggression.\nAs the nineteenth century developed, Amin goes on to argue, the French ceased to demand slaves and came to demand raw materials and agricultural produce instead. In Waalo they began to experiment with agricultural plantations but these failed because of 'the resistance of the village com› munities'. The French could not succeed in overcoming resistance to proletarianization until they had occupied the whole area and were able to use continuous force. But this colonial conquest came so late in the progression that resistance to it was not very effective. By this time Islam had ceased to be an ideology of resistance and had become the spiritual solace of the defeated aristocracy, who used it to discipline peasant culti› vators and to ensure that they produced whatever the French demanded from them. 39 If Amin argues that the really important resistances came before the Scramble, other historians employing the economic perspective seem to be arguing that the really important resistances to formal colonial rule came only in the twentieth century. Certainly there was plenty of economic resist› ance during the Scramble. In particular, the Europeans broke away from their old alliance with African traders and middlemen and used force to set up a monopoly of commerce.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries.

Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

And for the rest of the century, the internal trade for slaves among the coastal peoples increased because of the demands of the palm-oil trade.

In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850. In 1895 trade by way of the TripoliBorno route suffered from the operations conducted by Rabeh, and the disruptions caused mainly by the French conquests in West Africa had their repercussions.

At this time, trade in slaves (which had not been prominent under the Kamba) seems to have become more important. Kamba traditions picture this as the most disruptive period in their history: disruptive famine led to inter-lineage conflicts that were used by ambitious members of society to sell weaker ones to Arabs.$^{17}$ Kamba traditions, therefore, rightly indicate the relationship between the decline of trade in goods in which they themselves played a major part and the rise of the system of profiteering in persons in which the Arabs and Swahili traders played a prominent role.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies', 'content': ""accumulated from the trade. The rivalry for control of trade increased the social disruption and this was further intensified by population move› ments caused by the contemporaneous Nguni (also referred to as Ngoni in some of the literature) invasion. The consequent instability increased the number of people who were ready to follow enterprising leaders. In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another. In the 1860s the Arabs managed to have Mnwa Sele deposed and replaced by Mkasiwa, and Mnwa Sele's brother Simba left Unyanyembe to set up his kingdom among the Konongo to the south-west of Tabora. Another member of the chiefly family in Unyan› yembe called Nyungu ya Ma we left his country in 1874 to establish a well-organized kingdom among the Wakimbu to the south-west of the Wanyamwezi. Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state.

Abandawaki\'s letter on ""the truth as regards the dispute between the Egbas and Ibadans"" is pretty clear on this point, and seems to establish the fact that we were right in the opinion we thus expressed, while at the same time charging those fraudulent short measures, and an extreme adulteration with the responsibility of the injurious dispute between the Ibadans and Egbas, which is again threatening the trade of those countries and Lagos with a partial, if not entire, paralysis. He states that it is especially owing to those short measures and that adulteration, together with the deeds of violence on Ibadan traders to which the Egbas have resort, with a view of perpetuating these frauds, that the Ibadans are prepared to embark in a mutually destructive war with the Egbas and Ijebus, in order that they may conquer, if possible, the right to a free trading route between Ibadan and Lagos, and thus be enabled to carry on uninterruptedly, direct trade with the latter. If Abandawaki is right, and we fear there is no doubt that he is so, the Ibadans have indeed good reasons for desiring those direct trading relations with Lagos, or, as he says, with any other seaport, that will free them from the unjust monopoly and fraudulent exactions of Egbas and Ijebus.

Fifty years ago slavery was abolished, and then, instead of making a radical change in the methods of government which the altered conditions required, no action was taken, and the machinery of government was merely adapted to the circumstances. The British Administration has made practically no effort to conciliate the tribes in the interior, or to remove the suspicions which the early history of the colonies had implanted in the minds of the natives. Custom-houses were set up, and, as the natives derive no benefit from the expenditure of the taxes in the colonies, they naturally did not like the new institutions. Then, again, the natives on the coast hate those in the interior, and British administrators invariably sided with the former. The three Ashantee wars were due to this cause. If efforts were made to conciliate the Mandingoes, the Foulahs, and other large tribes in the interior, the trade of these settlements would certainly not consist, as it does at the present time, almost exclusively of the produce of the fringe of land adjoining the sea. The Americans and Germans, particularly the latter, are looking after this trade.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

This policy was carried on with much determination during the Second Empire, but has been pursued more vigorously than ever since the conclusion of the war with Germany. On the 10th of this month Reuter\'s agents informed us that a French officer, a Captain Combes, had taken up an excellent position on the Upper Niger; that three posts—Bamakou, Kondou, and Bafoulabé—were provisioned for twelve months, and telegraphic communication established between them. They further added that the launch of the French gunboat now on the Niger was preparing to descend the stream to Timbuctoo with the rising of the waters.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

It is impossible to say what towns he includes under ""&c.,"" but not only has the Niger Government never closed Idah to trade, but that place has actually been a port of entry for vessels ever since the issue of the charter. As a matter of fact, Onitsha, the most turbulent place in the territories, and the scene of constant trouble prior to the charter, is the only town that has ever been closed to trade. The prohibition, of course, extended as fully to the trade of the Company as to that of other foreigners. As the Company at that time (1886) was the only European trader in the territories, and had large commercial establishments at Onitsha, it cannot be seriously contended that the closing was in order to prevent competition. Moreover, in another part of his report, the German Consul says that ""competition with the powerful and admirably organised Company is as good as impossible in the same locality,"" which, whether true or not, is plainly inconsistent with his previous and absolutely unfounded imputation of motives for closing ""Onitsha, Idah, &c.""', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain and Portugal in East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '9.

As competition with the powerful and admirably organised Company is as good as impossible in the same locality, the monopoly is clearly expressed thereby."" This is a mistake. No such regulation exists. The Company, as a trader, is as much a ""foreigner"" in the Niger, and is subject to exactly the same restrictions as any other merchant. Disturbed districts may occasionally have to be absolutely closed for administrative reasons; though only one such instance—that of Onitsha—has actually occurred on the Niger since the issue of the charter, more than three years ago. But, subject to such possible dispositions in the interest of order, merchants, and others, including the Company, may live, build, and travel where they will. Trading vessels, including those of the Company, may, of course, only call where there are custom-houses. This principle is more or less stringently followed in every river where free transit is in force, as otherwise it would be impossible to prevent smuggling; but it is especially necessary in the Niger owing to the great number of creeks through which the main river may be reached from the sea, and to the necessity for preventing the smuggling of rifles, cartridges, and spirits. A free transit river, and especially where the revenue will not permit of coastguard supervision along thousands of miles of river back in a wild and malarious country, must be treated in this respect like a sea coast, where vessels may only communicate with the shore at certain points, although merchants and others may build, trade, or reside where they please on the land. As there are no less than twenty ports of entry on the 300 miles of the lower Niger, between Akassa and Lokoja, and a large number also on its tributaries or creeks, and on the river Benue and the middle Niger above Lokoja, this necessary system imposes no hardship on the commerce of either the Company or of other traders in the territories, who are in every respect on the same footing as the Company.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

In the nineteenth century, Aja refugees from the Werne river valley and the Porto Novo region swelled the ranks of related communities that had earlier settled in the adjacent parts of the presentday Lagos State and Ogun State of Nigeria following the Dahomeyan conquest of the coastal Aja states of Aliada and Whydah in 1724 and 1727 respectively.$^{27}$ This extension of the Aja culture area eastwards was a significant contribution of the nineteenth-century wars to ethnic interpenetration in the area under study."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': ""In addition, the captives which these kingdoms needed as a form of currency with which to buy rare goods and the instruments of war were being carried off at a rate which was becoming less and less compatible with the survival of the societies concerned, especially when they were seized from peoples already subject to tribute, since that depleted the reserves of the dominant powers. Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism.

Yet in 1879 this whole structure began to crumble, and by 1900 it had ceased to exist.' With the imposition of colonial rule, 'the characteristic link between Africans and Europeans was no longer that between trading partners ... The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance.

Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals.

At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

Amin is here describing resistances which were directed against an African aristocracy, but which were also a response to French economic aggression.\nAs the nineteenth century developed, Amin goes on to argue, the French ceased to demand slaves and came to demand raw materials and agricultural produce instead. In Waalo they began to experiment with agricultural plantations but these failed because of 'the resistance of the village com› munities'. The French could not succeed in overcoming resistance to proletarianization until they had occupied the whole area and were able to use continuous force. But this colonial conquest came so late in the progression that resistance to it was not very effective. By this time Islam had ceased to be an ideology of resistance and had become the spiritual solace of the defeated aristocracy, who used it to discipline peasant culti› vators and to ensure that they produced whatever the French demanded from them. 39 If Amin argues that the really important resistances came before the Scramble, other historians employing the economic perspective seem to be arguing that the really important resistances to formal colonial rule came only in the twentieth century. Certainly there was plenty of economic resist› ance during the Scramble. In particular, the Europeans broke away from their old alliance with African traders and middlemen and used force to set up a monopoly of commerce.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast.

The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up.

A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya. This was especially the case against the Nandi.$^{9}$ The Maasai example serves to illustrate the kind of dislocation that had taken place among the economies of various societies in this general area. Thus, colonialism came to an area already suffering from an economic crisis with all its attendant effects.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 340, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '04-11-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_05_1864', 'content': ""Your memorialists are perfectly satisfied, by information (now in England), Wm.

It remains now to inquire whether it was a legitimate war, and whether it is such as will be sanctioned by the laws of nations.\n\nI am very much against these native wars, as they have a most pernicious effect on the prosperity of the country; a flourishing people when once attacked is generally reduced to the utmost beggary; the invaders do not attempt to improve their condition, but reduce them to serfdom, and thus nip the little improvements which were being made. The kingdom of Woollie in former years was tributary to the King of Boondoo, the father of our present hero. After his death, a Marabout fanatic, Sakoo the Great of the East, rose up and invaded Boondoo, destroyed the town, captured a lot of the inhabitants, and paralyzed the government. After committing a great deal of mischief, he lapsed into a nonentity, and nothing more is heard of his conquests. Baccary Saidah, with great activity and industry—aided by the French, whose ally he is—endeavoured to renovate his tottering kingdom, called upon all the former tributary towns to pay their yearly quota, and to acknowledge the supremacy of Boondoo.\n\nThe King of Woollie, finding that he had increased in wealth and power, and sneering at the dilapidated condition of his once powerful but now questionable enemy, returned his demands, rather impolitely and with decided refusal, stating at the same time that he considered his kingdom perfectly independent of Boondoo. Baccary Saidah received the intelligence with unruffled countenance, but set about in great earnestness with reforms.\n\nAbout three or four years ago, the Marabout in N\'yanny rebelled against their rightful master, the King of Catabar, destroyed several towns, declared themselves independent, and treacherously killed Walley, the head chief of Coonting, and made that town their capital. The King of Catabar sent for the assistance of Baccary Saidah, who had been endeavouring for the last three years to get permission from the King of Woollie to pass through his country, but without success. Early this year he sent one of his sons and two of the princes of his realm to be kept as hostages for the good conduct of his men whilst passing through Woollie, but his Majesty, unfortunately for him, yielded to the imprudent advice of his Prime Minister, Saloom Jarty, and head chief Calley Walley, unsparingly used the ""cat"" over the backs of two of these hostages, and returned them with the third to inform Baccary Saidah, their King, that they had sufficient muskets and gunpowder ready for him, and that they had not known when ""cow-drivers"" had become warriors.* Baccary Saidah was very much enraged at the disgraceful treatment he had received from one whom he had hitherto called his friend, and raised the war cry in the ears of his large army, who were bent to avenge the insult—""To Woollie, to Woollie.""'}, {'id': 1311, 'article_title': 'River Gaboon.—New French Claims', 'full_section_title': 'River Gaboon.—New French Claims', 'last_edit_date': '02-22-1868', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1868#article-12', 'issue_date': '23_04_1868', 'content': 'Trade is wretchedly dull here, and on every part of the adjacent coast; this arises in a great measure from wars among the different tribes, which, having broken out almost simultaneously at different points, produce is very scarce and excessively dear, and provisions can scarcely be purchased at any price.

He thought they might look forward to going on at least as well as now, and with a future improvement. Having alluded to the loss the Company had sustained in the death of the late Chairman (Mr. Hadow), the Chairman moved the report.

By a semi-official Note sent to the Paris Press through the Havas Agency, it is stated that the Minister of Marine has received from the Resident at Porto Novo no official communication concerning the invasion of that territory by the troops of the King of Dahomey. At present the Minister has only heard of the matter by private letters and by the account sent to the Government by the French Consular Agent of Lagos. A small French garrison is at Porto Novo, but it would have, if attacked by the bulk of the Dahomey army, to get into the fort, and remain there until reinforcements were sent out. The French Government through the Temps, says it has received no information about the incursion unless through the Consul at Lagos and private sources, nor can it at once obtain answers to the demand sent to the military commander at Porto Novo, telegraphic communication being wanting.\n\nRecent advices report that at Massamedes, on the coast, a very valuable vein of almost pure copper has been discovered at a distance of about fifty miles from the port. It is stated that the neighbourhood is very rich in minerals, and that several copper mines are in close proximity to Massamedes.\n\nAt Kinsembo trade has been seriously interfered with, owing to a war between the chiefs of Quibo and Kacungo. The prisoners captured by either side were cruelly tortured and then beheaded. The natives have a superstitious objection to burning the heads of their victims, and the result is that they always behead their prisoners first and then destroy the trunks by fire.\n\nNews from Ambrizette reports that the Portuguese war ship Reine de Portugal had gone there to settle a dispute between the natives and one of the English trading houses there. It appears that some little time ago two of the natives were caught stealing, and they were detained by the representatives of the English firm until the King was disposed to investigate the matter and punish the offenders. The natives, however, effected a rescue. About four hundred of them surrounded the factory, and amid threats of personal violence they broke into the premises and carried off the two prisoners. The English firm thereupon made a claim for the value of the property stolen and damaged, and the Portuguese war vessel proceeded to the port.

Since the destruction of Ijaye, of which we gave so full an account, furnished by one who had been in Ijaye during the entire siege, the work of devastation and pillage has been constantly going on. A missionary authority, writing of the thousands enslaved at Ijaye and Ishagga, adds: ""The small farming towns between Abeokuta and Ijaye are forsaken and destroyed; the fields have returned into wilderness; kidnappers and wild beasts infest the bush; and where corn, cotton, indigo, &c., were produced, there are now briars and thorns."" Awaye, a town of several thousand farming people, has been taken by the Ibadans, destroyed, and the inhabitants carried away as slaves. The rage of war, the hate of tribe against tribe, is increasing. Makun, a town of 8,000 people, was taken by the Abeokutans, after a siege of three months. The people were all made slaves. An eye-witness says: ""Thousands of them were carried to Abeokuta, many in a miserable state, necessitating their being carried in baskets by their captors. It was a heartrending scene to see these poor people carried along—husbands without their wives, mothers without their children, the latter without their parents; and most of them destined to spend the remainder of their lives in slavery.""\n\nThe Ibadans are now encamped at Ipara, a small Ijebu town, about a day\'s journey south of Ibadan; the Ijebus and Egbas have their camp in Makun, a short day\'s journey south of Ipara, and only one day\'s journey from the coast. It is said that the Ibadans have pressed the Dahomans to attack Abeokuta under these favourable circumstances.\n\nThe same authority says that there seems to be no hope at present of any pacification. Men\'s passions are inflamed; there are many who love war for the sake of plunder; the love of man-stealing, of catching slaves, is increasing.

The Woolli people, however, attacked him, killed or took prisoners a number of his followers, and drove him into the neighbouring Nyani country, where he is now settled at a place called Toobacouta, and endeavouring to obtain allies from the surrounding tribes. Mamadoo Lanin is said to be a fanatical Mohammedan, and as such would find little difficulty in obtaining recruits among his co-religionists to join in a holy war. Such a person is a very disturbing influence in the Upper River, and if left alone would be likely to affect very seriously the trade of that district. He has sent messengers with presents both to Saide Mattie and Beran Ceasey, requesting their help, but it has been ascertained on good authority that they have both declined, Saide Mattie replying that ""a man must repair his own house before attempting to build one for a stranger.""

There was serious fighting reported not far from Lagos, and in consequence no produce could be brought to the town. So serious had been the effect on trade that the British authorities had ordered an expedition to be sent up to see about settling the matter. The expedition, which consisted of Houssa troops, under the command of English officers, had left for the interior before the Senegal sailed. From Lagos information was also received of the death of Major Vetch, an English officer, who had gone to the coast to organize a thorough system of police. Soon after arriving he contracted the coast fever, and died. Serious troubles were also reported at Bonny and Grand Bassam. At the former place trade was entirely at a standstill, whilst at Grand Bassam the natives were causing much annoyance and loss to the traders, a small steamer belonging to one of the English firms having been stopped by the natives as it was being brought to the coast with produce.

Still the commerce of these colonies is considerable, and quite worth looking after. The total trade of the four colonies in recent years averaged about £3,250,000. In 1884, the exports amounted to £2,000,000, and imports £1,700,000. Two millions of the total trade must be credited to the Gold Coast and Lagos, in which palm oil and palm kernels are of so much importance.

Nearly the whole of the expenditure is for administration, leaving little for public works and the development of the resources of the settlements. The exports during the past ten years show considerable fluctuations in value, depending partly on the market value of the staple products, and partly on the more or less disturbed state of the interior, where the native tribes are constantly at war with each other. In 1875, the value of the exports on the Gold Coast was £327,012; in 1879, it was £751,850; in 1881, 1882, and 1883, it hovered round £350,000; suddenly advancing to £667,000 in 1884. For Lagos, the exports were valued at £517,535 in 1875, £734,707 in 1877, £460,000 in 1881, £594,000 in 1883, and £672,000 in 1884. For the last ten years the exports of Sierra Leone have kept pretty steadily at about £580,000; in 1876 they sank to £297,000, and in 1882 and 1883 rose to £420,000 and £442,000. Gambia shows considerably more variation; in 1875, the exports were valued at £147,465, sinking to £86,000 in 1876, and, with intermediate fluctuations, reaching £254,711 in 1882.

During the past fifteen years its northern frontier had been constantly harassed by the inroads of the Mohammedans, who had made Ilorin their centre of operations towards the south, and by that renewed pressure from the north the inhabitants of Yoruba had not only been cut off from their former sources of supplies in that direction, but had also been forced to submit to the exactions and commercial blockade of their weaker kinsmen who inhabit the neighbourhood of the Gulf lagoons. These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands.

As night came on fighting ceased, and about 10 o\'clock the District Commissioner, Captain Barnett, assisted by one of the European residents, entered the town with a small detachment of Houssa police, and captured over 100 prisoners, besides some two or three hundred muskets and all the fetish drums. It is thought that the prompt and decisive measures adopted by Captain Barnett averted a much more disastrous result, and prevented the possible destruction of the trading factories. In the fetish house was found a kind of pie made in a large brass pan, which upon being examined was found to contain portions of two human bodies. The skulls were smashed in, the victims having been killed by a heavy blow. They must have been dead about a week. All is now quiet. The prisoners have been sent to Accra for trial.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast.

The textbook details how European powers, such as the British and French, employed military and diplomatic strategies to secure their economic interests, including monopolizing arms and ammunition to maintain power. It highlights the construction of transport and communication infrastructure, like roads and railways, as a prelude to conquest and resource extraction, underscoring the overlap of commercial and military objectives. Examples such as the Force Publique in the Belgian Congo and the Italian campaign in Libya illustrate the tension between these objectives, as colonial powers sought to control trade routes and suppress resistance. However, it also notes that the colonial economic system did not reach its prime until the Second World War, indicating a gradual intertwining of economic and political dynamics. Similarly, The African Times articles describe military operations by Germany and Britain on the East African coast to control arms importation and slave exportation, reflecting the intersection of military and commercial goals. They recount the use of gunboats and military expeditions, such as the German bombardment of Saadani and British intervention in the New Calabar River, to protect trade routes and suppress resistance. Conflicts involving the Dualla in Cameroon and the Settra Kroo Natives in Liberia further illustrate the complex relationship between economic interests and military actions. The articles also emphasize the challenges faced by colonial powers, such as the need for cooperation with local chiefs and difficulties in maintaining order without sufficient military presence, adding nuance to the claim.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa.

Less effective were embargoes on the export or import of items such as horses, weapons, salt or types of cloth, while an indiscriminate blockade of towns or areas was difficult to sustain, not least because smuggling offered high profits. But the disruption in the normal flow of caliphal trade caused for example by Ningi and Mbutawa raids was serious enough to require a remedy. Indeed their own experience of severe food shortages and the interruption of the grain trade during the djifiàd had made men like Muhammad Bello acutely aware of the importance of encouraging traders by keeping roads open, establishing markets and enforcing the laws regulating fair trading.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

These facilitated, partly caused, and were also in part the result of the changes we have noted above in the political structures and military systems. More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront. They were also deployed to produce goods for the local markets and for long-distance trade, so as to acquire the wealth necessary to attract more clients and buy imported arms and ammunition.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""The impact ofthe slave-traders on the political fortunes ofthe indigenous aristocracy was not uniform. In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Production and trade', 'content': ""The abolition of the slave trade by Britain in 1807 introduced an element of structural imbalance into this situation, especially in the south, where surveillance was instituted earliest and maintained most strictly, although domestic slavery was tolerated.$^{48}$ During the second half of the nineteenth century slavery expanded very substantially, especially in the Niger bend. This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange. It is not surprising, then, to find entire groups, such as the Zamberma, spe› cializing in the extraction of this 'black ore'. The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New political trends', 'content': ""Besides these centralizing trends, another interesting and in this case a completely new nineteenth-century phenomenon was that of modernization or, as some would call it, renaissance. Euro-African contacts, which until the beginning of our period had been confined largely to the coastal peripheries, were, in the period under review, steadily extended inland as a result of the Industrial Revolution, largely through the efforts first of explorers, then traders and, finally, missionaries. This steady extension of European contacts and influence inland included not only guns and powder, but also railways, telegraphs, agricultural and mining machinery, the print› ing press, technical education and, above all, finance capital. These new developments created opportunities, but also challenges and dangers. Among the most novel and interesting features of African history during the period were the initiatives and reactions of African rulers and advisers in the face of these opportunities and challenges. It would appear that in most cases the approach of the Africans was not simply one of blind imitation or wholesale substitution but rather one of adaptation and syn› thesis. Instances of this process of modernization in Africa are legion. 56 Egypt built its first printing press at Büläk, Cairo, in 1822; the first printing press was established in Portuguese Luanda in 1841; the first modern mines were opened in Algeria in 1845 and in the Gold Coast in the 1870s. Some of the states, such as Ethiopia and Tunisia, embarked on public works; nearly all the Barbary states, as well as Egypt reformed their monetary systems. Other states, such as Egypt, set up textile and cotton mills, saw mills, glassworks and paper mills, all during the reign of Muhammad 'AIL But more interesting and of far-reaching consequence was the moder› nization process in the military sphere. In the face of steady European encroachment, many African states, especially in North and West Africa, modernized the organization, training, equipment and recruitment of their armies. As will be seen in later chapters, Morocco, for instance, set up at Fez an engineering school to train artillery men, surveyors, and car› tographers and sent soldiers abroad for training.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""The naval squadrons were less concerned about suppression than about their task of protecting the 'legitimate' trade of their own nationals.

Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

Bristol captains who frequented that port were in the habit of supplying me with goods on credit, and as the credit system is general in our place, so I trusted also some of such supplies to people belonging to this town. These people became dilatory and afterwards unwilling to pay me for what I had given them on credit. As I must pay these captains, of course, I tried all means to come at payments, but it was fruitless. Being so pressed, I applied to the king of the place to enforce from the several debtors payments for me, which application the king readily complied with, but he was unsuccessful in obtaining any payments from the debtors for me. The king afterwards gave me permission to seize any oil which those debtors of mine might bring on the sea-coast for sale, till full payments were effected to me. On the strength of this I seized one of my debtor's, by name Ovorcoyrats, oil, which he had transported to the coast for sale. The oil amounted to eighty pots, about $160, which seizure was to be applied as part payment of what he owes me. Ovorcoyrats, therefore, was incited and instigated by all the educated traders, influential persons in that town, and those who cherished hatred against me, to do me harm; even the townspeople desired to kill me or to drive me out from the said place, but the king permitted them not to perform their evil intentions against me.\n\nA time after the seizure above-named, Ovorcoyrats took two women and three men belonging to my family captive and carried them away, and afterwards attempted at night to kill me in my own house, having collected in my yard upwards of 200 men, at the head of which he and his brother were.

Accordingly, one house of mine was set on fire by a certain Nar (trader) by name, and all the things I had in that house were plundered. During this plunder I escaped from my house, about which armed men were encircled, and reached the borders of the Volta, and was brought over on that side the river by a man by name Povoroo. An influential man from Jellicoffee, by name John Tay, sent messengers to me, desiring me to stop and remain on the Volta till he comes up to settle the palaver between me and the Addahs amicably.

Mr. Portal states that there has been the most friendly inter-communication between him and Captain Wissmann, who has shown anxiety to respect the interests and property of missionaries and British Indian subjects.\n\nEarly in June it was known that the power of Bushiri had been broken by the successful German attack of May 8. Bushiri\'s Arab followers were leaving him, and he was wandering from village to village, endeavouring to induce the tribes to take up arms. Relieved of opposition in the neighbourhood of Bagamoyo, the German authorities turned their attention to Saadani, where the English missionary, Mr. Brooks, and his followers were murdered in January. There was no hope of peaceful submission, and on June 7 the town was bombarded from the ships and a force of over 1,000 men was landed. The Arabs fled from their entrenchments and retreated into the interior. Captain Wissmann endeavoured to make peace with the people of Pangani, but the withdrawal of the German forces from Saadani was interpreted as a sign of weakness, and encouraged active opposition to the Germans, and so increased the difficulty of coming to an arrangement.\n\nAll remnants of opposition had disappeared from the neighbourhood of Bagamoyo, and Captain Wissmann had invited British Indian traders to resume their ordinary avocations under his protection. They flocked to meet a caravan of ivory which arrived at the ruins of Saadani; other caravans were arriving at Pangani; and, as the question of Pangani was disposed of, everything pointed to a revival of trade.'}, {'id': 6019, 'article_title': 'The African Times.', 'full_section_title': 'The African Times.', 'last_edit_date': '10-01-1890', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_10_1890', 'content': ""In another column, our readers will find an account, given on the authority of the Paris correspondent of the *Times*, of the probable causes which led up to the late—or, shall we say present—difficulty between France and Dahomey.

The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy. They seem generally to have found no less difficulty in understanding its use or reason than the King of Dahomey himself whose request to President Carnot for enlightenment was published some weeks ago.

The popular belief has been that the Admiral on the West African station, and the military forces employed in garrison duty in the same district have tried to diversify their monotony by picking a quarrel. The account now published, if true, relieves them of the burden of such a reproach. Neither officers nor men have any inclination to force their country into speculative enterprises in such a region as the Slave Coast. Personally they are not likely to win glory thereby; and for the State the consequences of such a contest are both painful and unprofitable. For the ascertainment of the source of this inglorious business attention must be directed to a very different quarter. Arms and commerce are proverbially at strife. Everyone sympathises with the trader's complaint of the confusion which warfare introduces into his affairs. He is the natural advocate and friend of peace, at least when his relations are with communities as advanced and well-regulated as his own.

It is true that the export in this locality is almost, although not entirely, kept under by the vigilance of the squadron, but this is only effected by keeping a number of men-of-war (there were six in December last) anchored within two miles of the coast, at short distances from each other, with armed boats in the intervals; an arrangement entailing the severest and most trying duties on the officers and men employed, and attaining its partial success only at very great cost to the country.\n\nIf the present trade of the settlements be compared with that of any other British possessions, it is not certainly of any great moment; but, such as it is, it owes its continuance mainly to the encouragement and protection which their presence affords it. Their exports in 1863 (the latest for which complete returns can be obtained) amounted to within a trifle of 650,000l., whilst their imports for the same period reached 533,000l.\n\nThe mode in which the trade is carried on has been already alluded to in the former part of the report, and it will be readily understood that a commerce, which is conducted chiefly by native agents, and to a great extent in countries inhabited by savage and lawless tribes, at considerable distances from the settlements, can only be prosecuted in safety when their influence is felt and their authority respected; indeed, notwithstanding the comparative security afforded to trade, local interruptions of it are but too numerous, and the difficulties which have arisen between the natives and ourselves have, in many instances, had their origin in robberies and assaults committed by them on our traders and their servants, so that the merchants are probably not in error in asserting that the complete annihilation of their trade would in most cases follow the withdrawal of the protection they now enjoy.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Royal Niger Company', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""## Taxation\n\nThe taxes are levied upon European trade, in the interests of which the administration was originally established, and as the Company is the principal trader it is also the principal taxpayer of its territories. The importation of arms and spirits is prohibited into the larger portion of the Company's territories. The duties collected on other articles are low, amounting to 2 per cent. upon many of the chief commodities of trade, but have given rise to much complaint and to not a little misapprehension.\n\nWith regard to the provisions of the Act of Brussels, the Anti-Slavery Conference which met in Brussels in 1889 came to certain conclusions concerning the most effective means for counteracting the slave trade in the interior of Africa. Amongst other steps were the establishment of strongly-occupied stations in the interior from which repressive action could be taken, the opening up of communications, the restriction of the importation of firearms and of ammunition into the territories infected by the slave trade, the prohibition within certain territories and the restriction in others of the importation of spirituous liquors. Most of these provisions were anticipated in the measures adopted immediately upon the assumption of administrative power, notably those referring to the prohibition and restriction of the importation of spirits and firearms. The formation of stations in the interior has responded to the commercial as well as the administrative requirements of the Company, and forts have been established along the course of the Niger and the Binué up to the limits of the Company's territories.\n\nThe development of an internal policy has been much impeded by two causes. One is the hereditary inter-tribal habit of slave-raiding prevalent within the territories, the suppression of which is essential before any real progress can be made. The other has been the necessity of the Company to devote the principal part of its energy to the settlement of frontier questions with France and Germany. In 1886 an agreement was made between Great Britain and Germany, by means of which a line of demarcation was drawn from the Rio del Rey, on the Gulf of Guinea, to a point on the Binué, a little to the east of Yola, the capital of Adamawa, one of the Mohammedan provinces of the Empire of Sokoto. Beyond Yola the line was left undetermined, and Germany, being anxious to secure the largest possible portion of the back country, despatched repeated expeditions with the object of increasing German influence in territories which the English company regarded as forming part of the sphere under its influence by treaties with Sokoto. The exertions of Germany called for equal exertion on the part of the Company, and the question of the German frontier was not settled until 1893, when the line of demarcation was carried by agreement to Lake Chad."", 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The situation in East Africa still engrosses a good deal of the attention of our politicians.

As regards the projected blockade, the Prime Minister has stated very clearly the views and intentions of the English Government. This country has undertaken, in conjunction with Germany, to establish a blockade upon the East Coast, and this blockade is to be ""against the importation of the munitions of war and the exportation of slaves; and for nothing else."" Thus the policy and intentions of England are clearly defined. We wish the same could be said for Germany.

What we have undertaken will be conducted chiefly on the coast which falls under British influence. In no case will British ships be called upon to afford support to any military movement which may be attempted by the German forces on shore. It is necessary to lay stress on this, because it appears that in some parts of Germany, at least, a desire is shown for the employment of military forces on shore. Lord Salisbury makes light of the apprehensions lest the natives of the blockaded coasts may fail to distinguish between the German and English flags. So long as England and Germany are engaged in carrying out a policy which England has made her own for many years past there is no reason why this difficulty should arise. We rejoice that Germany recognizes a duty to civilization which England has long discharged single-handed, and co-operate with her in a course of action from which we could not have held aloof without abandoning our traditional policy and doing violence to national sentiment. But if Germany is resolved upon making her efforts for the suppression of the slave-trade subservient to an attempt to recover her position in East Africa, there is only too much reason to fear that the natives may fail to distinguish between the German and English flags when they see them associated together.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-12-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1888#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export.

The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey.""

Either the entire administration and commerce of the Colony must be placed on a broader basis, and then a prosperous development of the Colony in every direction is expected with certainty; or the old course is kept up, and then the Colony will meet with unavoidable ruin. According to the present system the Colony must cover all its administrative expenses from the current receipts. These receipts consist, almost exclusively, in the duties levied at the coast. The income of the duty increases and decreases with the commerce in the Colony. German trade in Cameroons, however, is going backward, in consequence of the falling of prices for African products and of the trading monopoly of the tribes on the coast, which more than doubles, often quintuples, the price of the goods from the interior, thereby limiting the intercourse of the coast with the interior. If this continues, the end can easily be foreseen. The Colony will be less capable to recoup its costs of administration—it will require more and more support from the Empire and yet it will not improve. Within the frame of the present administrative system there is no means to check this sinking movement. For the cancer the Colony is suffering from, the monopoly of the Dualla, can only be cured by using stronger and powerful means. To do this the present administration is perfectly incapable. Its means only go so far as to carry out on the coast the most necessary police functions and to exert a limited jurisdiction. This limited power of the German administration does not reach beyond the coast. The armed force consists of a few black policemen in the gun-boat. But, like the Arabs in East Africa, the Dualla in Kamerun will not give up their predatory trade voluntarily; they will have to be forced to restrict themselves to legal commerce and to allow the Europeans to enter their commercial districts—the endeavour to force this, miscarried in East Africa on account of the lack of sufficient power, causing rebellion; a similar proceeding in Kamerun would also have similar consequences. If in East Africa half only of the means of power displayed later on would have been put into requisition at the beginning, a sedition would never have taken place; the Empire would have saved many millions, and the development of the Colony would have taken an undisturbed course. The predictions of the experts are similar now with respect to Kamerun. With relatively small protective forces the entire opposition of the Dualla could be broken. These protective forces would be sufficient to garrison a number of stations on the routes in the interior, facilitating to the German trade a safe pushing forward to the Hinterland. These 200 men could do as much service to the German trade in Kamerun as the 2,000 men of the protective forces in East Africa. It is said that the number of the latter is to be considerably decreased. If this opportunity be seized to transport part of them to Kamerun then the expenses of the new enrolment and equipment of the Kamerun troop would be saved, and we should have a victorious and well-trained troop entering into Kamerun.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1891#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SHRINKAGE OF EMPIRE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A short time ago, while the Congo Conference was sitting, England declared the navigation of the Gambia River, on the West Coast of Africa, open to the commerce of all nations.

As a matter of fact, the Government were compelled to do what they did by the squeezing-out process which the French have been so quietly but relentlessly employing against us in that region. This policy was carried on with much determination during the Second Empire, but has been pursued more vigorously than ever since the conclusion of the war with Germany.

They further added that the launch of the French gunboat now on the Niger was preparing to descend the stream to Timbuctoo with the rising of the waters.

I was also equally successful in making a similar agreement with the King of Woolli—both which agreements subsist to this day, and, on the whole, have been as faithfully observed by the two kings as could reasonably be expected. I was fortunate enough to prevent at that period the Almamy\'s ratifying a treaty with the French, whereby he was to bind himself to \'shut the roads,\' as it is called, against the \'coffles,\' or country caravans, proceeding from the neighbourhood of the Senegal to the Gambia through his dominions.

Next from his own knowledge he remarks upon ""the extravagant waste of ammunition in the slave-traders\' camps"" and then asks how it is that these same slave-traders, who ""for the last three years have been blazing away as though they possessed exhaustless supplies of gunpowder"" could still be so well provided with ammunition as to be able to keep up a heavy fire for several hours upon the Congo State forces. Putting two and two together, the conclusion at which he arrives is that one of the three Governments—Great Britain, Germany, and Portugal—must, in defiance of Article X., have been conniving at the importation of these fire-arms and this ammunition. If this be so, it is easy to see that the march of civilisation in the Dark Continent must be very seriously impeded. Every Government, in fact, can, by winking at the behaviour of its own subjects, very seriously interfere with the well-being of the territories of the other Governments. Unfortunately, it is easier to state the conclusion than to suggest the remedy. England may be able to answer for her subjects, though, considering the difficulties of African administration, it would not be surprising if sometimes she failed to keep all the sheep in check; at any rate, she cannot control the subjects of Germany and Portugal. It is much to be feared that so long as the slave-traders have the commodities wherewith to pay for arms and ammunition there will be found unscrupulous Europeans ready to smuggle them.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1893#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRADE IN BRITISH WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. Every effort should be made to open commercial relations with tribes hitherto inaccessible, either by inviting the visits of caravans from a distance, as a recent Governor of Sierra Leone did, or by encouraging exploring expeditions by British officers and others, as has been done in Ashanti and the countries beyond, from Cape Coast, or by attempting to arbitrate between contending tribes in the interests of commerce, as has been done in the Yoruba territory from Lagos. During the last decade, the Church, Scotch, and London Missionary Societies have shown themselves more enterprising on the east of Africa than on the west; and yet in the rivers of Western Africa there are better highways to the interior than the caravan route into the Galla and Wagogo countries.

Colonel Paris presided, and there was a large attendance of members and others interested. Commander Cameron, who, on rising, was loudly applauded, said: What he wished to speak about was the commerce of Africa, and what would come out of the Berlin Conference, and other events which were now happening; for the Conference could not fail to be of great importance to British trade. Tropical Africa, except in a few cases, on the shores of great water-ways, was scarcely known. From the interior the difficulties of transport prevented any profit except on the most valuable products. The first idea of the trader seemed ivory. India-rubber was coming into use, and before he left the West Coast over £20,000 worth had been exported from Zanzibar in one year. Many valuable gums and spices were found in Central Africa. Africa was to all appearance, until a few years ago, the happy hunting ground of Englishmen; it was only those who voyaged who could really compete with us. Now all these things were changed, and on every side they saw a scramble for Africa. It was our duty to know as much as possible about the resources of this continent, and how the future of Africa was to be controlled by the Congo Free State, which promised to be the outcome of the Berlin Conference. Very great results were to be expected, and he might mention that, north-east of Victoria Nyanza, there was a plateau which might be colonized by Europeans, and whence trade might be put into some of the great producing centres of Africa. The trade of the Arab at Zanzibar was carried out by a system of advance. On the west coast there was a trade carried on by a few Europeans. In the last century the Portuguese had an enormous trade up the Zambesi, and in Zumbo Town there were the ruins of a cathedral and a university which had at one time 370 students. There were two other towns of equal importance. The great difficulty in this trade was the climate. At a conference in Brussels in 1876, the idea of an International Association was sketched, and the King of the Belgians had set himself steadfastly to work to further this great idea of promoting the civilization of the ""Dark Continent."" Nearly all the people of Africa were traders; the cultivation of the soil was relegated to the women. At Nyanza there were enormous assemblies of people, some of whom came to market 15 or 20 miles, travelling against the current of the Congo. From this locality he had brought home nutmegs that were of the greatest use in commerce. From the same region there came wild coffee. There were enormous districts where any amount of rice could be grown; you had only to ""scratch the earth,"" and it smiled at you. At some of these interior stations whole caravans were supplied by small villages with wheat sufficient for a week\'s journey. The people of those villages were able to produce for from ten to twelve times their number with scarcely any labour. On the Niger we had utilized water traffic, and the Congo had a number of miles of water carriage which could be utilized. There was, at the same time, the great difficulty of getting from the coast to this system on the Congo. Various schemes had been proposed to connect Stanley Pool with the Congo by railway, and he believed that after the settlement of the dispute between France and the International Association, the French would construct a railway to Stanley Pool, or the Association from the left bank of the Congo, and they would then be able to have instant communication with the centre of Africa. Further south, the Portuguese were beginning to wake up to the value of their territories. They were now making contracts to construct a railway into the interior. It was their duty as Englishmen to look after that scheme. The region he was speaking of produced ivory, gum, cotton, and spices. The Powers at the Berlin Conference had recognized the International Association as practically a sovereign State. What they must strongly insist upon was free trade, and permission to reside and trade in the Free State. Another point was as to the mode in which future annexations were to be made. Annexations had been going on rather fast lately, and the Conference agreement was to the effect that when a place was annexed notice was to be sent to the other countries, and that people trading at such a place were to continue trading under the same guarantees as formerly. He fancied that would be simply that there might be equal rights to all nations, and people already trading in places which had no European sovereign might find their positions injured by annexation on the part of European Powers. In this matter, also, he thought that great care had to be exercised. Then they had to think of the great trade which used to pass down Egypt from the Upper Nile. The Suakin and Berber Railway was contracted for at one time by Ismail Pasha, but he was compelled to give up the idea. If that railway had been built, we should have had none of the difficulties in the Soudan which we had at present. He mentioned as a sign of the times that an Ambassador from Timbuctoo was at Paris treating with the President of the French Republic. We had the trade of the Lower Niger in our hands, but in the Upper Niger a great portion of the trade might be diverted from us if the proposed railway were completed. There was one thing which he must say, and that was that if we wanted outlets for our goods we must send proper and suitable goods for the people. The establishment of the Congo Free State would prove a benefit to English trade, but we must watch the constitution of that State, and, if there were any objectionable features in it, get them removed. In conclusion, Commander Cameron remarked that in a very large portion of Africa cotton of very good quality grew. He had specimens at home of cotton goods which had been made by the natives in the interior, and he believed that, as communication improved they would see cargoes of cotton coming to Liverpool from Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY IN CENTRAL AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Feb. 19, a paper on ""Slavery in its relation to Trade in Tropical Africa"" was read before the Society of Arts, by Commander V. L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)', 'content': ""Nowhere in West Africa had there been a longer tradition of confrontation between Africans and Europeans than in the Gold Coast between the Asante and the British.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""The third category of states included geographically and culturally distant peoples such as the Dagomba, the Mamprusi and the Gonja.

They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories.

Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Churchill wished to express his heartfelt sympathy with the hon. baronet in the death of his brother, and also with the families of the officers who had fallen in this strife. It appeared that the differences arose from the King of Ashantee demanding the giving up, under an extradition treaty, of an alleged offender, which Governor Pine refused to do unless evidence of his guilt were supplied, upon which the King of Ashantee threatened the invasion of our territory, and in the spring of last year he invaded the Protected Territories, and the Fantees were obliged to turn out in great force to meet the invasion. Major Cochrane was sent with an auxiliary force, but he failed in his support, and in consequence the Ashantees overran the whole territory, massacred 4,000 or 5,000 Fantees, and then retired, and it was to prevent the recurrence of such an event that Governor Pine applied to the Duke of Newcastle. In reply, his grace stated that he had considered the plans submitted to him, but he declined to give his adherence to them, and he enjoined upon the Governor that the principle of all military proceedings on that coast should be that of defence, and not that of aggression, and that on that principle alone were governors entitled to make war; but ultimately Governor Pine was authorized to strike a blow against the Ashantees, if it could be done consistently with the safety of the troops. The Duke of Newcastle had shown the utmost desire that the troops should be cared for in every way—(hear, hear)—and to inveigh against the Government for culpable negligence was to make a charge which could not be sustained. Stores of various kinds calculated to serve for a long time were gathered together, and the disasters which had occurred might be attributed to the two facts that the Tamar, which conveyed the troops, had arrived a month later than was anticipated, and that the wet season set in a month earlier than usual. The delay of the vessel was not remarkable when it was remembered that the troops sent from the West Indies had to be collected from different islands, and that the ship had to make her way in the face of the trade winds. He did not think, therefore, that there was anything very unusual in arriving a month after the time expected. As to the troops being located near Cape Coast Castle, it seemed that was one of the healthiest stations on the Coast. The principal charge seemed to be that thirteen officers had died. But when this was stated, the nature of the climate must be considered, as well as the fact that all persons who went there, including the black troops, had to pass through a period of acclimatisation. This return of the deaths of officers, it must be borne in mind, extended over the whole year. He would also remind the House that officers in the line, who were anxious for rapid promotion, often exchanged into West India Regiments, and he had made the attempt himself; but if they did so they acted with the knowledge that they were exposing themselves to a climate most deleterious to health. He rather regretted the precipitate manner in which the Colonial-office had written to remove the depot at the Castle, and this not for any ulterior design of invading the territory of Ashantee, but for the purpose of ensuring the safety of those under our protection. He wished more efforts had been made to construct roads, which would not only have been valuable in a military point of view, but which would also be useful in the furtherance of commerce, and this might have been done at a trifling cost, probably at 35l. per mile. The Ashantees received a large portion of their supplies by the river Volta, one part of which formed a part of our territories, and the other part belonged to the Ashantees. That could be readily blockaded and supplies be thus cut off. Large quantities of arms, ammunition, and other munitions of war were obtained by the Ashantees through the Dutch settlements also. It was quite possible by certain arrangements to put an end to this kind of traffic. With regard to our army surgeons, two of the most competent, who were sent out with our troops, were coloured surgeons, natives of Africa, and who had been educated in the British medical schools. It appeared that they were the only two surgeons who had never been attacked with fever, or the other diseases incidental to the country. He thought that this was an important fact, which proved that if we were to maintain troops in that part of the world it was most essential to employ coloured surgeons to remain with them.

We found, as the grandfather of Mr. Swanzy stated in 1816, when examined before the Committee of the House of Commons, that the whole country was impregnated with gold. Messrs. Swanzy are one of the oldest firms in the country, and on the question of modern gold mining they are amongst the first authorities. In order to develop gold mining, we shall have to obtain good machinery, and also seriously to face the big question of labour. At present it is not very difficult to find labour, but if we have taken the trouble to note the number of Krooboys employed upon the coast, in the steamers, in the oil rivers, and in the mines, we found that there has been an appreciable rise in the rate of their wages since working in the mines has commenced; so that I do not think, when the mines are properly opened, we can trust to Krooboy labour, or even to the Fantees, because the latter are beginning to find out that they can use powder, and that they can make more money for themselves than by working for wages. At one time the country was ten times more thickly populated than it is now, and the French, who lead us in most things in Africa, show us what should be done. Last December, 137 Chinese coolies were brought by the French to carry out some experimental works, and, during the five months they were working, not one of these men had died, as far as I have heard. If we can get a persevering race like that to do the work, the labour question will be solved; and now, when we see Chinese rice being imported into Africa, I cannot help thinking that the question of labour has begun to be solved. This is not my own idea, but I have thought it carefully over for some time, and I am convinced that the labour question will be a crucial test; though I believe it can be easily overcome if our Government will give consideration to a well-considered scheme for placing Chinese labourers in our settlements. If a person were able to obtain Chinese labourers, he could afford to pay them higher wages, because he would know he could depend upon an industrious race of people, and that he would be able to place his works upon a better footing. The people of Wasa are a most pleasant and civil race; they do not agree with our idea, perhaps, of the part we took in the Ashanti War, but they are a pleasant class to deal with. Many of the arms, and much of the powder used, are imported from the French settlement of Assini, where any ship might land stores without any restriction whatever.

This system had caused many disputes and jealousies between the two races, and there can be little doubt that the Fantees do their best to force all trade between the Ashantees and the coast to pass through their hands, and that the true cause of our difficulties with Ashanti has been this action of the Fantees. It would not be difficult for us to allow the Ashantees free access to a portion of the coast and prevent any collision between them and the Fantees.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence. When we think of how much has been effected in the consolidation and extension of our Gold Coast territories since 1871, we may confidently hope for a further extension and a great future for this rich and important possession. The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast. A most valuable arm they are likely to prove. They are very brave, very sober, and very loyal to their white officers.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRADE IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The question of the drink traffic and King Ja Ja's troubles, which have been subjects of discussion in the House of Commons lately, ought to attract increased attention to the trade of West Africa.\n\nOur oldest settlement there is at the mouth of the Gambia river; but though the oldest, the total import and export trade amounts to only £380,000 a year. With the exception of the Senegal, the river is the finest on this part of the coast, but it is almost useless for trade purposes, because the country is in so disturbed a condition. Wax, hides, and ground nuts are the principal exports. The ground nuts are sent to Marseilles, where a substitute for olive oil is pressed from them. Rice, cotton, maize, and a kind of millet are also produced, but not in sufficient quantities for export. The charge on ordinary merchandise is 2 per cent. _ad valorem_.\n\nSierra Leone, with a coast line 200 miles long, has a trade of a different character, the produce of the palm, nuts and oil, hides, gum copal, ground nuts, ginger, and kola nuts being exported. The gum copal and the palm oil are for the most part shipped to Great Britain, and the hides to the United States.\n\nThe most promising place of all in this part of the world is Lagos, where the natives are eager to trade. The exports are palm oil and various oil seeds; but although the chances of business are excellent, British rule has failed to develop trade to anything like the extent that was anticipated. The reason is the isolation of the settlements, which were originally slave settlements. Fifty years ago slavery was abolished, and then, instead of making a radical change in the methods of government which the altered conditions required, no action was taken, and the machinery of government was merely adapted to the circumstances. The British Administration has made practically no effort to conciliate the tribes in the interior, or to remove the suspicions which the early history of the colonies had implanted in the minds of the natives. Custom-houses were set up, and, as the natives derive no benefit from the expenditure of the taxes in the colonies, they naturally did not like the new institutions. Then, again, the natives on the coast hate those in the interior, and British administrators invariably sided with the former. The three Ashantee wars were due to this cause. If efforts were made to conciliate the Mandingoes, the Foulahs, and other large tribes in the interior, the trade of these settlements would certainly not consist, as it does at the present time, almost exclusively of the produce of the fringe of land adjoining the sea. The Americans and Germans, particularly the latter, are looking after this trade.

Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast.

Herr Flegel and his companions have endeavoured to take advantage of the colonizing fever from which Germany has been suffering to raise up a company in Germany to take advantage of the Niger being free to all to use it for the approach to its principal affluent, the Benue, and make that a preserve for German traders. He alleged that he had made treaties with many chiefs, and that their country had been ceded to him and placed under the protection of the German Empire. English enterprise, backed by mercantile prudence and foresight, has established trading stations in terms of amity with the natives, and negotiated binding treaties with the chiefs, so that now, when Herr Flegel and his compatriots again put in their appearance on the Benue, they will find their hopes of founding a German colony there somewhat difficult of accomplishment.\n\nIt is to be hoped in the interests of trade and good order that as Great Britain has now declared herself responsible for good order on the Niger, she will maintain an efficient staff for that purpose, and prevent trouble between the native chiefs and the traders, and not only despatch a punitive expedition after outrages have taken place. The Niger penetrating into Mohammedan and partially civilized countries, has a great advantage in the demand for manufactures over rivers, the inhabitants of whose banks are savages, ignorant of wants, and only wear clothing to satisfy the whim and fancy of the moment.

The way in which they have finally resisted the advance of the little handful of British troops and native allies upon their capital, fully justifies the reputation they had obtained for personal bravery and military skill; while the uselessness of their resistance shows how completely all those countries in West Africa, within a hundred or two hundred miles of the sea-coast, are at the command of the civilized powers of Europe, of whom Great Britain alone has taken any real interest in their affairs. After the evidence which the Ashanti expedition has supplied, there cannot be a doubt—and there ought not to be a doubt in the mind of any native African authority—that 5,000 British troops, supposing they could be made secure from the evil influences of climate, and that they could obtain proper food and means of conveying sufficient ammunition, could traverse native Africa from east to west and from north to south, everywhere triumphant. Is not this a great lesson for West African potentates and other native authorities? The King of Dahomey will do well to take it seriously to heart, when meditating another grand diabolical ""custom,"" with its unspeakably horrifying human sacrifices; or another inroad into the Egba territory, in pursuance of his insane ambition or revenge against Abeokuta. Abomey is not more than half the distance from Whydah that Kumasi is from Cape Coast, and the country is much more accessible, open, and practicable for a body of troops. Christian Europe—now that Ashanti horrors have been so fully exposed, and, we will venture to hope, put an end to—will not much longer tolerate similar and even worse practices in Dahomey. We, at least, will do our part, that they shall not. If Great Britain does not interfere to put an end to them, some other European power will take possession of Whydah, and do so. It would be a conquest rich in mercantile results, while invaluable in the cause of outraged humanity and not a little important as regards facilities for introducing to the knowledge of those great truths, which can alone successfully combat and destroy the debasing and destructive sway of Satan, so long supreme over the vast countries of West and Central Africa. While thus giving warning to Dahomey, we should be greatly wanting in our duty if we did not give a word of advice—and we would have it looked upon as a large one—to our friends, the Egbas and Jebus. Our friendship for Abeokuta is too well known and has been too well evidenced for any one to deny or dispute it; we have given many and great proofs of it, and, therefore, we ought not to be misunderstood, when, with all our heart, we counsel and advise the authorities there and in Jebu, not to raise or prolong causes of contention with the British authorities in Lagos; or put forward pretensions which the well-known and, even in West Africa, sufficiently well understood principles by which British action and government is guided, must prevent her listening to. Egba, Jebu, their kings, authorities, and peoples, have nothing to fear from Great Britain, while they cultivate friendly relations with her Government in Lagos, and do all they can to facilitate and extend their trade with that place. But—and let them lay this well to heart—they can never be safe if they choose to pick quarrels with the Lagos Government. If this does wrong to them at any time, they may be sure that such is not the wish or intention of the Queen’s Government in England; and their representations, if made directly to it in a proper manner, will be sure to receive attention, because they will be seconded by us and other friends of Africa. We see a great and proud future for Abeokuta, and the Egba and Jebu countries generally, if they will but comprehend their true interests, and show themselves ready to second the English desires for the extension and development of trade and resources in them and beyond them. We have a mental view—we can see that future in our mind, though native African prejudice may prevent it from becoming a reality for yet a short time—we have a mental view of a good road, and soon after, even a rail or tram road, from the Lagoon, through Abeokuta, to Ibadan, in one direction, and to the Niger at Rabba, in another. These would make Abeokuta the great interior emporium of trade with the whole of that vast African interior, from the sea-side to the Niger, and the further side of that river; and Lagos, the great shipping port for all the produce—a hundred, aye, and many a hundredfold more than passes through her at this present time. This is an eventuality that must and will be realized. No opposition that native Africa can show, will prevent the progress of that great march of trade and commerce, which caters for the wants, and fulfils the demands of the civilized world that the natural resources of the whole earth shall be developed, and the products be made to minister to its use and enjoyment; while, in return, it imports its civilization and its wealth. The people of Jebu and Abeokuta do not at present comprehend the great advantage they have in Lagos being a British settlement. They do not seem to be conscious of the importance of the fact that this secures them at all times, upon certain and easy conditions, a safe port for their trade—a full security that the trade which must in time make Egba and Jebu, with their industrious populations, fat with wealth and riches, can never be interfered with by any other power; whereas, if Great Britain were not there, there is more than one other that might and would seek to conquer and keep possession of those countries, the undeveloped wealth and future possible importance of which is at last beginning to be understood and appreciated in Europe. No man can be a friend to Egba and Jebu who does not advise and entreat them to be always close friends with Lagos and its British authorities. Whatever his pretensions may be, if he counsel them to any other policy, any other course than this, he must be their enemy. In close alliance and friendship with Great Britain at Lagos, they have, as before observed, not only a happy present, but a glorious future before them—a future in which Great Britain will largely assist, and to which, without her friendship and aid, they can never attain. Close friendship with England means no more attacks by Dahomey; but possibly a subjection of Dahomey to Abeokuta. With the close friendship and alliance of Great Britain, this, and much more than this, is possible to a strong and determined people such as are the Egbas; while without it, they can never be free from uncertainty and danger.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-03-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_03_1874#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present is a very critical time in the history of the British West African Colonies.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

The slavery which exists among the pagan tribes in the Niger territories corresponds to the serfdom of the Middle Ages. In some cases a slave inherits from his master, to the prejudice of his relations. In other tribes slaves have practically complete control of the State. The dark side of the picture is that at religious festivities slaves are sacrificed to their gods. The Company lately engaged in a small war with the powerful tribe of Asava, who refused to abolish the barbarous custom. Although the tribe numbered 20,000 men, the Company proved successful, and the custom has been abolished. No doubt the example will be followed by neighbouring tribes. The Company consider it impracticable to proceed to uproot the religious prejudices and fanaticism which have existed in these tribes for untold generations, but they hope that the contact with civilization will work to that end.

The configuration of the basins of the rivers Niger and Binué as they float to the sea may be represented by the letter Y, of which the tail stands on the Atlantic coast. The distance from the confluence of the rivers to the coast is about 300 miles. The district is traversed from west to east by rising ground from which other rivers running parallel with the main flood of the Lower Niger flow also to the sea. These minor rivers are known under the general name of the Oil Rivers. Their mouths constitute coast ports where African trade has for a very long period been carried on. The names of the seven principal Oil Rivers are Benin, Brass, New Calabar, Bonny, Quaebo, Opobo, and Old Calabar. The coast district through which they flow to the sea spreads east and west of the mouth of the Lower Niger, and forms one British dependency known as the Niger Coast Protectorate. It stretches from the frontier of Lagos to the Rio del Rey, which is the frontier of the German Cameroons. The mouths of the Niger and the territory lying round and enclosed by the rivers Niger and Binué up to the limits of the British *Hinterland* in the interior, constitute the sphere of influence of the Royal Niger Company, which for purposes of convenience may be spoken of as ""Nigeria."" Thus we get in this portion of British West Africa three separate British dependencies—the colony of Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate filling up the space between the French and German frontiers upon the seaboard, with the Royal Niger Company\'s territory of Nigeria spreading Y-shaped into the interior and possessing on the coast only the narrow riverain strip by which it commands access to the sea.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The collapse of Old Oyó', 'content': ""In c. 1800, the most important single power and the one that held sway over most of the lands and peoples of the Mono-Niger region was the Old Oyo empire.$^{6}$ While the core area of this renowned Yoruba state hardly extended beyond localities situated between the Osun and Ogun river basins, the territory from within which tribute came and over which discernible military, political, economic and cultural influence or control of varying degrees was exercised was approximately the western half of the area covered by this chapter.\nIn the extreme west, the Aja state of Dahomey was reduced to tributary status in 1748 after a series of Oyo attacks from c. 1740, and it remained so until the early 1820s; Porto Novo had been similarly reduced when it was secured by Oyo as its main port for the export trade in slaves.$^{7}$ The route linking this port and Oyo ran through the areas of the Egba and Egbado sub-groups of the Yoruba who had to be controlled by Oyo imperial authorities through the posting of Oyo state officials (ajele) to such strategic Egbado settlements as Ilaro and, later, Ijanna.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

They tried to exercise some influence through the trusts or credits they gave to Efik traders; and sometimes used economic sanctions by collectively suspending trade with any defaulting Efik merchant. But when, in the nineteenth century, the Efik began to quarrel among themselves, the traders came in as arbitrators and kingmakers.\nMissionaries of the Church of Scotland Mission reached Calabar in 1846. They formed a little self-governing colony of five to six white missionaries, teachers, staff, and converts, at Duke Town and Creek Town.

A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards. In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition.

Some of them were large and powerful while others were small and weak. But all of them had participated in a regional trade network whose routes connected most of the major capitals. It was into this regional trade network that the inter› national trade from the East African coast was to be absorbed. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the most powerful of these kingdoms were probably Buganda, Bunyoro and Burundi.

A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

These characteristics made it particularly vulnerable to the destructive effects of the slave trade, since there were no large states able to protect their citizens. Rather, the various Igbo communities would appear to have engaged in inter-group wars, raids, and kidnappings for slaves to sell to the delta states and the Efik of Calabar, who served as middlemen. That is, although Igboland provided most of the slaves sold at the ports of Bonny, and Elem Kalahari, in the Niger delta, and at Calabar on the Cross river estuary, the Igbo did not come into direct contact with the Europeans before the nineteenth century. Also, the Igbo country was not reached by visiting Europeans until the closing years of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. And these initial contacts took place along such river routes as the Niger, the Imo, and the Cross river. Thus the communities at the market centres on the rivers at which the coastal middlemen met hinterland traders became better known than others. The Aro who controlled the internal trade routes and some of the markets at which the coastal middlemen purchased slaves and, later, palm oil and palm kernels became notorious for their abilities both as traders and as the operators of a well-reputed oracle. Similarly, the Ndoki towns of Akwette and Ohombele on the Imo river served as the markets for Bonny and Opobo. On the Niger, the states of Aboh, Osomari, Oguta, Asaba, and Onitsha provided market centres which were the foci for external influences and contacts.\nAlthough the Atlantic slave trade was formally abolished by the British in 1807, it lingered on on the coast till about 1850. And for the rest of the century, the internal trade for slaves among the coastal peoples increased because of the demands of the palm-oil trade. Similar demands for man› power in the production of palm oil and palm kernels, as for crop farming and ritual services, encouraged the continuance of the internal slave trade within Igboland.$^{8}$ Accordingly, the slave trade and slavery must be con› sidered an important factor for social change in Igboland for most of the nineteenth century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1800-45', 'section_title': 'Coast-hinterland trade relations', 'content': ""long-distance trade of East-Central Africa and was the major pre› occupation of most Yao.

They forget the fact that a wound which can be inflicted in a moment cannot be healed for a long time. I state it as an indisputable fact which can bear any test of investigation, that Captain Glover, during the period of his administration of the government of this settlement (from 1863 to 1872), managed to inflict such serious political wounds on the minds of the Egbas and Ijebus, that it is surprising he and his friends should expect those wounds to be healed in the very short time in which Governor Hennessy tried to heal them. Happily for Lagos Lord Kimberley sent out Governor Hennessy at the time he did; otherwise I cannot say how serious the state of things in Lagos would have become.

He thinks that an important trade with that country may be opened up. He pointed out that all the trade must be done through Lagos. For 500 miles along the coast of West Africa there was but one break of any importance in the monotonous stretch of steeply sloping shore, but one natural harbour where the waters of the lagoons escaped into the sea. With the exception of Lagos, there was no place where cargoes could be landed without danger of being damaged or destroyed. When in 1862 the English took possession of this port the name of Lagos stood out upon the map of the world as a hotbed of fever and a nest of slavery unequalled even in the Dark Continent. Apart from the slave trade there was little commercial activity in the place. Matters had improved since then. The health of the town was no worse than that of Kingston or other low-lying West Indian ports, and the inter-tribal wars which had caused misery to the inhabitants of the interior were being settled. In 1862 the imports were £77,932 9s. 7d. and the exports £61,952 9s. 4d., in 1866 the imports were £220,766 and the exports £262,699, and in 1879 the imports were £527,871 and the exports £654,379. Since 1879 the total values had remained, in round numbers, from £900,000 to £1,100,000, in spite of the steady decrease in the price of produce and of goods. When he mentioned that palm oil reached £52 per ton in 1862, and had sunk as low as £17 10s. in 1888 and 1889, it would be understood that the apparently stationary condition of the trade of Lagos during the past twenty years represented in reality an increase of about 100 per cent. in bulk. As shown in the tables of steam tonnage entered and cleared, the increase was still more remarkable. The trade of the colony came from four chief sources, which might be roughly described as the western or palm oil district, in the neighbourhood of the coastline; the Oguru river valley and Abeokuta, to the north; and the lagoon limits of the Jebu country and the strip of coastline known as the Lekki district, to the eastward. Still further towards the east was the Ondo route, which ran from Arijon, on the lagoon side through Ijesha and Ilorin to Shonga on the Niger. This last route might be considered as the main source of the supply of ivory and Niger produce to the Lagos market. It would appear that the output of produce in the western district of the colony had nearly reached its maximum for the present, and that the same might be said of the producing power of the Abeokuta neighbourhood. Perhaps a third of the total trade of the colony was derived from the eastward markets of Ijebu, Ondo, and Mahin, and his object now was to state a few facts which had an important bearing upon the question of the future development of this Eastern traffic. In the early months of the last year he was employed on a political mission to the interior of Yorubaland, and was greatly impressed with the commercial future of the Yorubas; and it would help the development of their prosperity if the interest of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce could be excited to encouraging more direct commercial relations with this people. Between Yorubaland and the coast was a large district inhabited by the Ijebus, who acted the part of middlemen, and strongly resented the intrusion of foreigners. They retained the whole of the interior traffic in their own hands. Mr. Millson gave a glowing account of the country further north, which he visited. Its several towns he described as populous, and the whole district as affording great inducements for trade. Ibadan was one of the chief towns, and Oyo, where the king resided, was a city of 40,000 people. From Ibadan to Oyo—which is about 800 ft. above the sea—the country was a veritable garden; food was extremely cheap, and roads good for foot passengers. The population of Central Yoruba, the area of which could not exceed 7,000 square miles, must be estimated at not less than 3,000,000. Each of the large towns was surrounded with farm villages and hamlets, which were scattered for many miles in all directions. It was a land of plenty, and in the more upland regions as healthy as most tropical countries. To turn from these considerations, he would mention a few facts which bore upon the commercial prospects of the country. To deal in the first instance with palm oil, it had to be accepted that the market was at present strictly limited to local consumption in consequence of the exactions of the middlemen, and that the price bore the same proportion to European values as that of other articles. Just as maize, which fetched only 4½d. for 70 lb. in Ibadan, was sold for 2s. 6d. to 4s. in Lagos, so palm oil in Ibadan was purchased for 2s. 6d. per 11 gallons, or £3. 15s. a ton, as compared with £17 10s. to £23 10s. in Lagos. Now when it was considered that the whole of the richer lands of Yoruba had scattered among the farms, on an average of from 12 to 30 to the acre, fully bearing palm trees (the fruit of which was allowed to rot upon the ground as soon as the limits of local demand were reached), it was clear that the supply of the coast markets would be increased at a most profitable rate were free communication possible. The native would eagerly avail himself of such an opportunity for increasing his wealth and indulging his taste for travelling, bargaining, and European luxuries. In the same way palm kernels, the shipments of which formed nearly half of the total exports of Lagos, commanded a merely nominal price in Yoruba. A measure of kernels was purchased by him at Ibadan for 1s. 6d. which would have fetched 5s. in Lagos. It was unreasonable to suppose that the Yoruba would hesitate to avail himself of such profits when he persisted in cultivating his land in so laborious a manner for the most minute gains earned by any labourer in the world. From Abeokuta alone, since its inhabitants had had free access to the markets of the coast, nearly half the trade of Lagos had its origin. Abeokuta was a large city of 100,000 inhabitants; but Ibadan was still larger, was hardly any further from the lagoon side, and was inhabited by a more industrious people. In addition to the supply of palm oil and kernels, Lagos would profit by a large supply of cotton which was already in demand among cotton spinners in England. He was informed by the Secretary of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce that they would be willing to accept as much as could be put upon the market. It was the opinion of competent observers that with the introduction of improved qualities of cottonseed the future of West Africa as a cotton-producing country would be of great importance. Experiments had been made in the Lagos Botanic Gardens with a view to discovering the quality of cotton most suitable to the soil and climate, and it would appear that Egyptian cotton offered an encouraging future to cultivators. A supply of seed was procured from the Government of Egypt, and sufficient quantities to enlarge the sphere of these experiments had been distributed among the kings and chiefs of the interior. An inquiry was to be made into the methods of planting followed in Egypt as compared with those adopted by the natives of Yoruba, and it was to be hoped that the interest shown by these people in agriculture would be directed into this new channel. Into the question of other articles of commercial importance it was not his intention to enter, but he might mention ivory, shea butter, benniseed, cotton cloths, fibres, gums, coffee, and cocoa as offering scope for the development of minor industries. When he stated that over 80,000 young plants of cocoa, coffee, cocoanut, kola, and other valuable trees had been distributed since the month of May 1888 by the botanic centre of the Colony of Lagos, and that over 60,000 of these had been purchased by the natives, it would be understood that one was not in error in counting upon their interest in agriculture as a means of profit as well as of actual maintenance. It must not be forgotten that the Yoruba was by custom a fully clothed mortal. It was considered unfashionable to appear in the public streets without a complete covering of two or three ample and well-dyed cloths draped round the body in not ungraceful folds. The Yorubas consumed each year about 31,500,000 yards of cotton, silk, grass, and mixture cloths. Of this large supply of cloth more than 95 per cent. was of home manufacture, made of home-grown cotton, dyed with native dyes, and woven of yarn spun by hand. Nearly 25 per cent. of the total population was engaged in preparing cloth for the native market. The richer cloths alone, such as silks, velvets, velveteens, satteens, and damasks, were purchased from Lagos through the Ijebu middlemen by the chiefs of the interior at most exorbitant rates, representing in many instances nearly 200 per cent. of profit. Accepting the annual consumption of native cloth in Yorubaland at 30,000,000 yards, and reckoning the price at not more than 3d. a yard, we had the somewhat startling figure of £375,000 as the value of the yearly output of the native looms. Assuming that European merchants would not be able to supplant more than half of this, we had an increase in the output of cotton goods alone amounting to £187,000. To this must be added an equal consumption of tobacco, spirits, hardware, &c., which should increase the imports of the colony by £400,000. This would, of course, represent an equal or greater export of palm oil, kernels, cotton, ivory, and other articles which had at present no market.\n39'}, {'id': 6207, 'article_title': 'The Situation at Lagos', 'full_section_title': 'The Situation at Lagos', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1892#article-2', 'issue_date': '02_05_1892', 'content': 'From Accra, under date April 21, we are informed that the Jebus and Egbas combined threaten Lagos.

Carter, K.C.M.G., in responding, said that on his arrival in Lagos he was called upon to deal with an interior complication in connexion with the Jebus. The Jebus had acted as middlemen to the Yorubas, and barred them from access to Lagos, and hampering trade by tolls against the Yorubas bringing down their produce. This system had been the great bugbear of Lagos, and the attention of every administrator had been directed towards some means of abolishing it. The Jebus were a most intractable race, who would not alter their methods of government or system of trade. He found on arrival at Lagos, that this people had offered a gross insult to the acting governor while on a visit to Jebu Ode, endeavouring to settle a dispute, and to make some settlement in regard to freeing the roads from the interior to the Jebu country. Her Majesty’s Government, therefore, decided to insist upon an apology from the Jebus, and also upon a permanent settlement of the road question. A treaty was made but was kept but a very short time, and when an officer was sent to ask for an explanation his life was threatened; under such circumstances he felt further forbearance should not be exercised, and had no hesitation in recommending that they should be compelled to fulfil their treaty obligations. The result was the Jebu expedition, which had done more for the Colony of Lagos than any event since the cession to the British crown. The Egbas had closed their roads in sympathy with their neighbours; but the friendly intercourse was shortly resumed. The main incidents of the last expedition were known, so there was no necessity to dilate upon them. A treaty was concluded with the Egbas and the long-standing war between the Ibadans and the Ilorins was brought to a close. Apart from these points, a mass of information had been acquired in regard to interior affairs which could scarcely have been obtained in any other fashion. The recent events in Lagos had brought to the front the question of railways, and he had not been unmindful of this important factor in the development of new countries. Hitherto he had not been sanguine as to the prospect of West African railways, but his acquaintance with the Yoruba country had entirely changed his opinion. It has long been considered in Lagos that a railway in Abeokuta would offer the best chances of financial success, as it would traverse a fertile country, and its terminus would be close to Lagos. There was one important point in discussing the question of an interior railway. At present the Egbas withheld their consent to such a project, though he did not despair of removing their objection. In such matters progress must be slow, and it must not be forgotten that until his own visit no governor of Lagos had ever been permitted to enter Abeokuta. He did not anticipate any serious difficulty with the Yorubas, but they had not formally consented to the project. In the event of the construction of a railway to Ibadan, it would soon be necessary to extend it to the eastward, possibly as far as Ikirun.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE WEST AFRICAN CRISIS—CONFERENCE IN LONDON', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**Mr. Fairley** said that those interested in the trade of Lagos had met repeatedly to consider the closing of the trade routes through Abeokuta and Jebu to the capital of the Colony. The entire trade of the Colony depended on the route through Jebu territory, Lagos having natural advantages for trade development owing to its situation at the mouth of the waterway communication with the sea, which tapped some 20,000 square miles. Action on the part of any of the tribes to block the way affected the whole of the different authorities, as they were dependent on one another for the maintenance of private treaties affecting their slaves. Internal feuds might exist on matters affecting the people themselves, but within seventy or eighty miles of the coast any disturbance was apt to block the transit of goods, and trade became paralysed. Great Britain having defined, along with France, a boundary between Dahomey and Yorubaland, and having assumed the latter country as a sphere of influence, had responsibilities which she could not disregard, and the promotion of commerce, of missionary enterprise, and the well-being of the people demanded her attention. It was essential that there should be free communication with the interior, and that the Yorubas should not be prevented from bringing their produce to the coast. The authorities of Jebu had taken an antagonistic attitude to the Government of Lagos on account of its remonstrance for blocking the routes. A visit of the acting governor was treated with disdain. Subsequently an apology was demanded, failing which steps to compel obedience would be taken. On Jan. 21, Jebu messengers visited Lagos and made apologies for insults given to the acting governor, and afterwards a treaty was entered into. Following this the Egba authorities at Abeokuta closed their roads, and the letter containing the remonstrance was returned unopened. The Jebu authorities had intimated that the agreement was made without authority, and the result was that the whole trade was blocked on every side. They were of opinion that Clause 2 of the Jebu agreement was the cause of this combined action of the authorities of Abeokuta and Jebu. The Jebus in the past had put Abeokuta under obligations to them for returning the slaves passing from Yorubaland to the free soil of the British Colony, and the Jebus had had large payments for these services, which, together with the taxes on merchandise passing through, brought a larger revenue than the £500 provided for in the agreement now repudiated. And the authorities of Abeokuta professed to be aggrieved at the British having taken over the protection of the kingdom of Ilaro, bordering on Dahomeyland. Ilaro was conquered by the Egbas fifty years ago, and paid tribute to them until some few years ago. Abeokuta, being unable to give protection to Ilaro against Dahomeyan raids, Ilaro made a claim to independence, and sought to place itself under British protection. This was done by proclamation on Aug. 13, 1891, and following the decision of the Brussels Conference Ilaro would be included in the Protectorate. The authorities of Abeokuta subsequently recognised the right of Ilaro to protection from the Lagos Government. The time has come when the Government must take steps as would ensure freedom of passage to everyone, and having made arrangements to see that they were carried out. They asked this not only on commercial but humanitarian grounds. They believed that a display of force would bring about all that was wanted, and while so much activity was being displayed elsewhere in Africa it was not inappropriate that the present position should be taken advantage of to put an end to those interior difficulties which caused stoppage of trade and widespread misery to the population of Yorubaland.', 'last_edit_date': '1892-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1892#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Memorial of the West African Company, Limited, Showeth,—That your memorialists have a deep interest, as a commercial company, in the promotion and prosecution of trade, and in obtaining an adequate supply of cotton from the West Coast of Africa, in which quarter they have for several years anticipated with sanguine hopes and expectation its extensive and increasing cultivation.\n\nThat judging from the rapid increase in the growth of this plant up to the year 1859, at which time 3,417 bales were exported from thence to England, your memorialists have had reason to expect the exportation to this country, since that time, of large quantities from the districts of Abeokuta and Lagos, stimulated, as its growth must necessarily have been, by its recent great increase in price.\n\nThat, notwithstanding these reasonable expectations, the exportation of this article, as well as of palm oil and other products, from those districts, has wholly ceased.\n\nThat your memorialists, and many other merchants, have several hundred bales of cotton, and many thousand pounds' worth of other produce lying at Abeokuta in a wholly useless and deteriorating condition, arising solely from the fact that they are not allowed to remove their property from thence to Lagos for shipment, either by road or river.\n\nThat, as a consequence of this prohibition, the mercantile establishments of your memorialists, and of other merchants, which in such a climate of necessity entail very considerable cost in their maintenance, are totally inactive; and if the existing obstructions to trade and to the removal of their property are permitted to continue, they cannot look forward to any other result to themselves than that of absolute ruin.\n\nThat your memorialists have well-grounded reasons for believing that this state of things is attributable solely to the conduct of the tribe inhabiting the Egba territory, at Abeokuta, and the tribe inhabiting the Ijebu territory, and to their respective advisers; and the following statement may be relied upon as affording the true explanation of the causes which have subjected your memorialists and other merchants to the obstacles, losses, and apprehended consequences to which they have adverted.\n\nThe two above-mentioned tribes entertain towards the European settlers of the new colony of Lagos a jealous and unfriendly feeling; and partly from this cause, and partly also from the fact that they are at war with the tribe inhabiting Ibadan (who are anxious to trade with the settlers at Lagos), they have united together in a compact to close up against all traffic and communication the river Ogun—the high road from Abeokuta to Lagos, and the ancient high road from Ibadan by way of Ikoradu to Lagos, and by these means to lock up all British property in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-04-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.746, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Blocking of Trade Routes at Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A MEETING of merchants of Liverpool and Manchester engaged in the Lagos trade was held on March 8, in Liverpool, to consider what steps should be taken in view of the closing of the trade routes outside Lagos and the consequent stoppage of trade. The meeting was very largely attended. Mr. HENRY DUNKLEY explained that the meeting was really called to see what should be done under the present circumstances to show the Government the seriousness of the situation, and to strengthen the hands of the Government in taking such steps as would bring about the reopening of the trade routes. He remembered a similar step being taken by the Egbas about 1861, and then the roads were kept closed for about five years. The correspondence which his company had received showed that the closing of the roads was the result of a premeditated plan, as the Egbas had for some time past been buying salt, tobacco, and other articles, so that they might be prepared for such a step. He did not know if any treaties were made by England with the Egbas similar to that with the Jebus, but if they had the Government should compel them to carry out their agreement, and all present should support the Government in moving to put matters on a permanent footing for the future.\n\nMr. JONES said he thought the meeting premature, as the Government would not do anything till Governor Carter returned from the interior. If it were true that the slave traders suffered at Abeokuta by their slaves escaping to the British settlement and becoming free men, and that this was the reason why they blocked the road, then the sooner the British authorities showed their abhorrence of such a thing as slavery the better. Indeed, he thought that the British authorities ought to go further and insist upon the slaves in Abeokuta, which is so near the British settlement, being free. This was a matter which every Englishman ought to take up.\n\nMr. T. E.

With regard to the lately-made Jebu treaty, it was open to question how far the King recognised it. It was made by two who undertook to represent the King, and under this treaty it was arranged that the British Government should pay £500 a year on condition that the roads were kept open. The Colonial Office were under the idea that the reason the Jebus did not carry this out was because the Government had lately been trying to induce those tribes to allow of Free Trade. Free Trade the Natives did not want, because the produce came down through their territory and they wanted to put a toll upon it.\n\n**Mr. Fairley** said it was on account of the exorbitant duties that the Government took any action at all. A piece of cloth sold in Lagos for 6s. when it passed through the tribal King's hands became worth £1, and it was not surprising that he wanted to repudiate the treaty.\n\n**Mr. Lawrence, M.P.**, said that our Colony at Lagos was a strip about ten miles wide, and goods had to pass through a tract of country about forty miles wide. The duties were something outrageous, amounting to 200 per cent. Owing to the blocking of the strip outside our Colony man hunting and catching had increased. People could not do legitimate trade because of the duties, and they found it easier to go and catch a slave than to do legitimate trade. We had warned the French away from Abeokuta, but what was the good of doing that if we denied ourselves the right of trading with the Egbas? We were not going to say that the Egbas might do whatever they liked and snap their fingers at us.\n\n**Mr. Tomlinson, M.P.**, asked if those high duties had only been put on since the attempt was made to repudiate the treaty.

In regard to the Jebus, it was only a few weeks since a treaty was made with the Governor of Lagos, by which it was engaged that the roads through their country should be kept open for the transit of goods and merchandise, in consideration of a yearly subsidy to the King and chiefs.

The manner in which the cession of Lagos was obtained in 1861 made the interior tribes look upon the English with suspicion and distrust, and consider their country in danger of being some day wrested from them. To add to this suspicion and distrust, the first Governor who was sent to rule the newly acquired settlement in 1862 (the late Governor Freeman), set himself up, and acted so loftily in all his communications with Abeokuta, that the Egbas became embittered against him, and he increased this bitter feeling by sending on to Abeokuta in May, 1862) Consul Taylor, whom the British Government sent to reside in Abeokuta, in so unceremonious and off-handed a manner—instead of doing things according to native ideas and customs, by first sending civil and polite messages, and so preparing them to receive him—that the Egbas refused to receive him. They were already made suspicious and distrustful of the English by the Governor's acts towards them, as prior to this Governor Freeman was known to have been sending messages to the Ibadan, with whom they were then at war, by Captain Glover (then commanding Her Majesty's ship Handy in these Lagoons), against whom the Egbas entertained bitter feelings for having, during his travels to and from the Niger in previous years, through the Egba territory, forcibly carried away a large number of Houssas (slaves of the Egbas) to the Niger territory. Instead of trying to remove this feeling by mild and courteous acts and expressions in all his communications, he continued to write imperious, insulting, and threatening letters to the Egbas, telling them in plain language that their country would be taken away from them if they continued to quarrel with the English Government at Lagos. Now I ask, Mr. Editor, were not the Egbas justified in resenting, in the best way possible, expressions such as these? In short, the Egbas remained sour with Lagos. When Governor Freeman left for England, Commodore Wilmot (now Admiral Wilmot), then commanding Her Majesty's naval squadron on the West Coast, came to Lagos, and went up to Abeokuta with the acting Governor, Captain W. R. Mulliner, to try and appease the Egbas, and put matters right again; but immediately on their return to Lagos, and before the good Commodore could do anything, Captain Glover arrived as Lieutenant-Governor; and it is known how much squabbling there was between the Commodore and Captain Glover, because the Commodore could not agree with Captain Glover in his intended policy. Captain Glover's name, for the cause already stated, set the Egbas in fresh rage, as they considered that they were no longer safe. Hence arose all the troubles and annoyances which the Egbas gave to Lagos. Added to this is their having been desired by Captain Glover privately—when he went to their camp at Makun, to treat with them—to come and destroy the town of Ikorodu, to revenge both themselves for Ikorodu having sided with the Ibadans in the war, and Captain Glover for the insolence of the Ikorodus to him when he went to their town in 1862; the Egbas little thinking that it was only a scheme of Captain Glover's to draw them near the Lagoon, and so expose themselves to the fire of rockets and shells which he had prepared for them in aid of the Ikorodus. On that day when he suddenly fired upon them in March, 1865, the Egbas lost over 700 persons killed. Can they be expected ever to forget this act of treachery on Captain Glover's part? This deep wound remained in the minds of the Egbas and continued to rankle in their breasts, so that they determined to drive the white men from their country. This it was that moved them to plunder and drive out the white missionaries from Abeokuta in 1867, when they heard that Captain Glover was placing constables in all the towns along the road from Ebute Metta to Otta. They looked upon it, not as intended to protect the road from lawlessness, which was a pretence, but as an occupying of the country which intervenes between Lagos and the Egba territory, which occupation they looked upon as a preliminary step towards encroaching upon and occupying all their territory; for, said the Egbas, so long as these white men remain among us, so long shall we have endless troubles with Lagos. After this, matters remained quiet, no doubt from some check to further action being sent to Lagos from the Colonial-office. Trade went on, and confidence was beginning to be restored, as many of the old chiefs died in the meantime, and the people began to be interested in lawful commerce; and had Capt. Glover allowed this quietness to continue and not have interfered with the internal policy of the Egbas and Ijebus in their dealings with the Ibadans—their interior and warlike neighbours—the trade of Lagos would have remained undisturbed and flourishing, and all the commercial disasters which have recently taken place would have been unknown. But no! Captain Glover would not have the Egbas and Ijebus do what they think best for their own country's safety. He tried to bully and bribe both Egbas and Ijebus to give open roads to the Ibadans in the beginning of 1871; and because they would not be bribed nor bullied, nor allow him to dictate to them, he prohibited the export from Lagos not only of arms and munitions of war to the Egba and Ijebu territories, but also all sorts of iron, nails, cask-hoops, farming-implements, &c.; at the same time that he got the Ibadans to assist him in frightening the tribes bordering on the eastern side of the Ijebu territory, north-east of Lagos, into opening a road for the Ibadans by which they might obtain supplies of arms and ammunition to strengthen their hands in attacking and fighting the Egbas and Ijebus, and forcibly obtaining the short road to the coast through the Ijebu country. This so irritated the Egbas and Ijebus, that they concluded to stop all trade with Lagos, so that the white man, who was giving them so much trouble and so harassing them, and whose acts were imperilling their safety, should go out of the country. They therefore closed the trade in March, 1872."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-03-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Blocking of Trade Routes at Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""On the motion of Mr. J.

It is necessary, for the purpose of developing the resources of these countries, that all the roads leading to them should be kept perfectly free and open, and it is their opinion that an end so desirable can only be attained by a policy, on the part of this Government, of non-interference in the politics of the surrounding countries, in which Lagos can have no possible concern. For some time past the policy of non-intervention has been disregarded, and one of an opposite character substituted, which has led to a stoppage of the Abeokuta roads, and threats of immediate closing of others. The policy of intervention above-mentioned is exemplified by following facts.\n\nIn the latter part of 1869 a blockade of Iheri was established by Tywo, who left Lagos openly with an armed expedition for the purpose of recovering his own debts; on his arrival, he seized several persons (about twenty) as hostages, took them to Ikorudu, and kept them until part of his debts were paid.\n\nThe blockade lasted six months, and was detrimental to trade in Lagos, and only beneficial to Tywo himself, all business with Iheri being stopped, and his monopoly complete. One incident occurred as follows: About thirty Lagos traders went to Iheri, but on the way, beyond the jurisdiction of this Government, a Lagos constable challenged the party, which disavowed his authority and proceeded to the market; on their return, they were arrested and taken to Government House, and subsequently imprisoned for one month by the police magistrate.\n\nTywo, who is a native trader of great influence, has been further supported by this Government on many occasions, to the detriment of independent trade here. For instance, about two months ago, he stopped all Egba trade except through Iheri, forcing Egba traders to sell at that market instead of coming themselves to Lagos, and only allowing those canoes to pass down that were directed to his factory here. A new measure of produce was introduced here, which met with great opposition on the part of the natives, but it was enforced by the constable sent from Lagos; some leading merchants here complained to the Government of this interference, and offered direct proof of the facts, but could obtain no satisfaction.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_06_1872#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Recent Troubles with the Jebus', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From Lagos, under date June 20, we are told that the markets in the Jebu country have re-opened, and the natives have resumed trading.

We have no doubt it will be the same on the present occasion, and that, when the Dahomans shall have been routed and chased back to their own country, the River Ogun, which will by that time be in full water, will be thronged with canoes bearing the much and long-desired produce to Lagos. Since the native authorities in Abeokuta and Jebu will have obtained the certainty that the late Administrator, Captain Glover, will no more be sent out to the West Coast in any capacity, so as to have the power of interfering in any way in their affairs, we can see no reason why the good understanding between them and Lagos, so profitable and necessary to both, should not be at once restored.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

While the articles highlight the broader impact of these conflicts on trade, they do not explicitly differentiate the impacts based on regional development levels, unlike the textbook, which suggests varying impacts depending on regional development.

Yet in 1879 this whole structure began to crumble, and by 1900 it had ceased to exist.' With the imposition of colonial rule, 'the characteristic link between Africans and Europeans was no longer that between trading partners ... The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance. Hopkins warns us not to imagine that Niger delta traders like Nana Olomu were forerunners of nationalism or spokesmen for popular griev› ances, pointing out that their 'vision of social justice did not include the emancipation of their own slaves'. Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

The rivalry for control of trade increased the social disruption and this was further intensified by population move› ments caused by the contemporaneous Nguni (also referred to as Ngoni in some of the literature) invasion. The consequent instability increased the number of people who were ready to follow enterprising leaders. In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another.

Another member of the chiefly family in Unyan› yembe called Nyungu ya Ma we left his country in 1874 to establish a well-organized kingdom among the Wakimbu to the south-west of the Wanyamwezi. Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state.

These covered a large part of Tanzania and, on a smaller scale, western Kenya. Traditional rulers who were able to control the trade were also able to accumulate the imported goods with which to build up a large army and to expand administrative machinery. Weaker states were either raided for slaves or annexed to form larger entities. In these areas the effect was either constructive in that it enabled certain rulers to build up bigger kingdoms in areas previously supporting smaller states, or destructive in the sense that it encouraged rebellion, which in turn destroyed the unity of the states that existed. Despite this generalization, the effect of the long-distance trade was generally destructive. There is no need to detail here the evils of the trade in human beings. But even the value of the material base built on imported goods was deceptive. Most of these goods were luxury items: beads, bracelets and other ornaments. What was useful was cloth, but even this competed with local sources of production which were eventually destroyed. Worse still, the trade in luxury goods and the general violence caused by the need to raid other societies in order to maintain the trade, meant neglect of subsistence agriculture. It is unlikely that the new structure could have been maintained even if colonialism had not intervened. In fact few of the large states built up during this period survived intact to the 1890s.\nIn order to illustrate this general picture it will be necessary to look briefly at the three caravan-route regions. In discussing the Kamba, we noticed how even their control of trade declined when raiding for slaves became prominent. The Kamba were a non-centralized society. The long› distance trade probably encouraged an enlargement of scale of various traditional institutions, beginning with kinship, village age-group and defence organizations. But none of these became the basis for a centralized state structure. In the whole of Kenya, only in the western region did the coastal trade lead directly to an enlarged and centralized political system.

The acquisition of firearms, especially, increased their capability to raid others.\nAs they raided, they accumulated cattle, hoes, ivory and captives; the last two could be sold to coastal traders for all kinds of luxury goods including textiles, bracelets, beads, tableware and, above all, firearms. Larger states could raid smaller ones, but all of them raided the neighbouring noncentralized communities, who suffered the most. The exception of Rwanda and Burundi (already mentioned) shows that it was possible to form an alternative strategy in dealing with this penetration of trade. Their strength came not from acquisition of guns but from their ability to maintain stability and unity in the densely populated mountain environment. Their extensive wars and raids during the period enabled them to accumulate wealth in a situation in which ivory and captives were irrelevant.\nThe second region we have deliberately omitted in this section is southern Tanzania.

The Sudanese and Muslim character of these societies made them more stable than those of the Gulf of Guinea, but they were nevertheless deeply affected by changes in the external demand for their products and people. The slave trade from this region had been declining since the 1760s, with a brief increase in the 1780s. Neither the legal abolition of the British slave trade in 1808 nor the effective en› forcement of the French anti-slave-trade legislation in 1831 niade much difference to a trade that was already declining but nevertheless continued in a small way in various disguised or illegal forms until the 1850s. The more important economic change was the enormous increases in the prices offered for Senegambian products. By the 1830s, the annual average value of gum exports was already more than five times the value of slave exports at their peak, and alongside the revived gum trade were remarkable increases in the export of gold, hides, ivory, and beeswax, with the ground› nuts that were to be the major export by mid-century also beginning to make an appearance. 3\nThese changes in foreign trade made enormous differences in the local economies as well, shifting income from those who had once profited from the slave trade to new groups who were in a position to profit from the new production. From the late eighteenth century, and for reasons that were at least partially independent of the European factor, Islam began to gain a new dynamism; The peasantry began to convert en masse, partly as a form of protest against the aristocracy that was seeking to profit from the new economic currents by raiding the peasantry rather than protecting it. Senegambian societies thus found themselves caught between two new forces, a newly aggressive Islam and the new economic influences of a world economy being overturned and remade by the forces of indus› trialization.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Production and trade', 'content': 'During this period, to an even greater extent than is the case today, the basis of economic activity was agriculture.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

The slaughter is said to have been fearful, at least a thousand men having fallen on both sides. The Bonny men went up to New Calabar with their war canoes, having in them empty casks, which were to counterfeit casks of palm oil for trading purposes. At the bottom of the boats, however, were lying Bonny warriors to the strength of four thousand eight hundred men. These landed at different parts of the beach, but the casks were very prominently displayed. Immediately on gaining the shore there was quarrelling amongst the men, and the new arrivals swung their oars above their heads in a very threatening manner. Thinking that there was some disturbance, most of the men in command of the fort hurried down to the beach. The ruse had thus the desired effect, and the Bonny men marched up the hill to capture the stronghold. A powerful chief, called Warraboo, was in charge of one of the storming companies, and as soon as he rounded the bend of the hill he saw a large force ascending on the opposite side. This was the other company of Bonny men. Warraboo, mistaking them for the enemy, opened fire upon them with a Gatling gun, while his followers also fired their muskets. The fire was most deadly, and was kept up for some time, until the supposed enemy rushed pell-mell down the hill. At the bottom the retreating army was met by the New Calabar men, and, escape being thus cut off, a desperate fight took place. It was estimated that, in addition to those killed by the New Calabar men, the number of slain through the blunder of Warraboo was at least five hundred. Notwithstanding this loss, the Bonny men succeeded in capturing the fort, and were in possession of it at the latest accounts. There was much excitement at New Calabar, and uneasiness was felt for the English traders and other British subjects, as there was no Consul or other British official to watch over English interests. The New Calabar men were numerically strong, and if they were reinforced by the followers of Ja Ja, as it was feared would be the case, the war must resolve itself into wholesale carnage. It was expected that when the news reached the English authorities, one or two gunboats would be ordered down to the scene of hostilities, as nothing short of some demonstration of this kind would have the effect of stopping the war. Trade in both Bonny and New Calabar is entirely at a standstill. In Bonny outposts are stationed all along the beach, and no person is allowed to land after dusk. The penalty for an infringement of these restrictions is death. One native landing from a vessel was asked to give the password, and being unable to comply, was shot dead instantly by one of the sentries. Up to the latest accounts no British representative had arrived, and further fighting was believed to be imminent.'}, {'id': 6019, 'article_title': 'The African Times.', 'full_section_title': 'The African Times.', 'last_edit_date': '10-01-1890', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_10_1890', 'content': ""In another column, our readers will find an account, given on the authority of the Paris correspondent of the *Times*, of the probable causes which led up to the late—or, shall we say present—difficulty between France and Dahomey.

The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy. They seem generally to have found no less difficulty in understanding its use or reason than the King of Dahomey himself whose request to President Carnot for enlightenment was published some weeks ago.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district.

Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880.

This time, the hold-up was extended to Western Nigeria, and it ended only with the intervention of the British government. A commission of enquiry headed by Nowell$^{81}$ revealed that the marketing system, which involved thousands of intermediaries, was both inefficient and wasteful, and was disadvantageous to both the producers in West Africa and the consumers in Western Europe.\nThe United Africa Company (UAC), an amalgamation of many former British firms, was the most prominent and most powerful firm in West African trade after 1920. It alone handled nearly half of West Africa's overseas trade during the 1930s, and dominated British West Africa, 82 especially Nigeria. The Company's subsidiaries operated in East and Central Africa, but their role there was much smaller.

There was an overall revival of coercion in economic relations, indicating that the colonial economy had to be buttressed by non-economic means when in crisis. African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported. However, in East Africa the 'Asian' merchants were essential for keeping the money economy intact and avoiding reversion to barter, just as their capital had been the original basis for the extension of specie and small-scale money exchanges throughout the region.$^{16}$ In the final analysis, therefore, the British administration co-operated to protect the interests of these retailers and produce buyers.

The tendency of West African merchant firms to monopolize through 'pools' is well known, and trading companies throughout the continent guarded their interests by refusing to compete in such a way as to raise prices. Indeed, intermediaries such as the 'Asians' in East Africa and the Lebanese in West Africa also set prices and conditions among themselves so that the African peasant had little choice when he went to make his sales. The cash-crop farmer faced the prospect of being gypped at the weighing scales, in the processing stage (as with the cotton ginnery), in transportation, in the calculation of returns and in the repayment of loans or advances where applicable. African producers were also making retail purchases from the middlemen traders and the commercial firms. A fundamental inequality marked the exchange between the colonial economy and the metropolises. This unequal exchange was reflected in the disparity between the low remuneration Africans received and the relatively high cost of manu› factured imports; and it also manifested itself in the low wage rate in the colonies as compared with the metropolises. Of course, unequal exchange was not a purely economic phenomenon. It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason.

In 1856, Macgregor Laird established the first trading station at Onitsha, and in 1879, the United African Company was formed out of the many rival British firms attempting to trade along the Niger valley. It received a royal charter in 1886 as the Royal Niger Company with powers of government. It established one of its main depots in Igboland at Asaba, complete with constabulary and trading station. Missionary activities among the Niger Igbo had been started as early as 1856 at Onitsha under the leadership of Ajayi Crowther and other freed slaves from Sierra Leone, some of them of Igbo origin, and belonging to the Church Missionary Society. However, the Catholic Society of African Missions (SMA), from Lyons, established rival stations on the west bank of the Niger from the 1880s; first at Asaba, and later at Isele-Uku, and Ibusa.\nThus, the first inroads into Igboland were made by the traders and missionaries, along the Niger.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'. The European-controlled Atlantic trade, on the other hand, 'did not give rise to any productive forces: on the contrary, this caused a disintegration of society ... African societies obviously opposed this worsening of their situation, and Islam served as the basis for their resistance ... The Muslim priests tried to organize a resistance movement; their aim was to stop the slave trade, i.e. the export of the labour force, but not to end internal slavery ...

But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system.

We could not accept this as the worthless result of our labours. It became evident that some other means must be employed. There was but one—a commercial combination that, having other principal operations, would, on certain conditions, make what we wanted in the Niger an accessory. That combination was found in what is now the ""Company of African Merchants."" But their condition of action was necessarily the same as that previously imposed by those who would have made it a principal—viz., Government co-operation, by a subsidy for a limited period. The difference was, however, an essential one. Government aid was no longer required to enable a company to be formed, or to bolster up a company. Here was a powerful body, with an ample subscribed capital, who, though having a profitable field for its full employment elsewhere, were yet ready to treat with the Government on terms of equality for a work which it was everywhere believed the Government were anxious to have performed. They made their proposals to the Government for enabling the latter to achieve what had been long regarded as a great national object, and as indispensable to the spread of Christian civilization in Africa. They did not seek any exclusive advantages. So far from this, they have, we believe, consented to associate another company, the West Africa, with themselves in this noble work. They offered to carry up traders and their goods at fair rates. They offered to repay the Government advances out of profits, should there be profits out of which to repay them. They stated distinctly that if the Government could find any other person or persons to perform the same services for a specific period, such as would alone suffice to solve the problem as to whether the Niger could or could not be made the field of a self-supporting commerce, they were perfectly willing to leave the work in such persons\' hands, without in any way opposing or embarrassing them in their efforts. Would it have been believed that this should have given rise to a virulent and combined opposition on the part of others, not one of whom would come forward for the work, and very few of whom had anything whatever to do with the trade on the Coast within 500 or 1,000 miles of the embouchure of the Niger? And yet such has been the case. We mentioned last month that a deputation of the African trade had been received by Lord Palmerston. The object of that deputation was to oppose any Government grant for the Niger. Since then memorials have followed in the same track. If the Niger cannot be traded in in the same simple way in which trade is carried on with the Coast districts, or in rivers not requiring steam navigation, the Niger, forsooth, ought to be left unnavigated and untraded in. The principle established in the discontinuance of trading consuls has, as we have already stated, been contended for as applicable to this case of the Niger. But surely nothing can be more dissimilar. If the parties opposing the grant, for several of whom we have a personal esteem, had trading establishments up the river, or if they were offering guarantees to the Government that they were about to form and maintain such at their own risk and charge, the principle would apply. But without these it does not apply. Not one in twenty of the opponents could be even indirectly affected by it; and we can only see in the opposition the evidence of that hostility to progress in Africa which declares roads to be unnecessary, which deprecates the establishment of civilization in place of barbarian rule, and which does not hesitate on occasion formally to declare that Africa suits best as she is.'}, {'id': 474, 'article_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'full_section_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_11_1864', 'content': 'If we have been silent since July last on the subject of the navigation of the river Niger, it is not because we have become indifferent thereto, but merely that we have been unable till the present month to insert the residue of the papers laid before the House of Commons in June, 1864.

With the Sultans of Gando and Sokoto he has made treaties which give the company command of the Niger up almost to Timbuctoo, and of the Binue, its great tributary, to the limits of navigation. The company are at liberty to trade over all the dominions of these potentates, and treaties have been drawn out with such exactitude that neither the Sultans nor any European rivals can misunderstand them. Indeed, it is stated that Herr Flegel, who followed Mr. Thomson on the Binue on behalf of a German company, has been summarily turned out of the river. Mr. Thomson speaks in the highest terms of the value of the Niger as a trade route. The whole country is densely peopled with Mahomedan tribes, who have a passion for voluminous wrappings. The country is fertile, and, with ordinary care, not unhealthy. It is pretty certain the British Government will formally recognize these recent acquisitions of the company by extending to them its protection. Mr. Thomson was cordially received by the Sultan of Sokoto, who seemed delighted at the prospect of having direct trade dealings with England.\n\nIn Mr. Thomson\'s work on the Central African Lakes, he takes a desponding view of the resources of Africa. These resources, except in a few places, he believes not worth developing. One of these places is the Niger region, that river, according to him, being the only one of any commercial value. In this pessimistic view he is supported by Dr. Fisher, who preceded him in the Kilimanjaro region, and who had before that resided for seven years in Zanzibar. Dr. Fisher has just published a little volume (""More Light on the Dark Continent""), to show that from a commercial point of view Africa is worthless! Dr. Fisher\'s statements do not apply to the Niger region; they may do so to Angra Pequena, which has just been pronounced a desert, while Dr. Lenz, who touched at the Cameroons on his way to the Congo, gives a gloomy account of that German annexation.'}]","[{'document_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The above paragraph follows immediately the statement that ""promises have been made to those chiefs [in the Niger] that trading ports should be established in their territories."" To procure a continuous and dependable steam navigation on the Niger and its tributaries, with the formation of trading ports there, had therefore, to say nothing of the preceding eighteen years, been for the last six years the recognised Imperial policy. Dr. Baikie was maintained in the Niger, in furtherance of this policy, at an expense of not less than 2,000l. a-year. Several voyages of Her Majesty\'s gunboats up the river had also been made during those years. Dr. Baikie\'s reports had been published from time to time by Her Majesty\'s Government, in order to afford information and, as it was evidently hoped, inducements, to the mercantile community. But all had been in vain. Strenuous efforts were made among the African merchants in London and Liverpool to induce them to fulfil the Government desire on the basis of a subsidy. But they either scouted, or lent but an inefficient countenance to, the proposal. Individually and collectively, they would ""have none of it."" Things remained in this state till the powerful Company of African Merchants, with its fully-subscribed capital of 400,000l., came upon the scene. The opinions and views of persons hitherto not engaged in African trade, but who became shareholders of this company with the express condition that it should co-operate, if possible, with Her Majesty\'s Government for carrying forward the Imperial policy in the Niger, were now brought to bear on this question. And only thus could any body of merchants, whether as directors of a company or otherwise, have been brought to consent to take upon themselves the great labour, as well as risk, of such an enterprise. The field, as already stated, had been long open—no one stepped in to occupy it—all turned their backs on it, until the Company of African Merchants, acting under the impulse already described, agreed to enter on certain conditions, such as had been on a former occasion accepted by Her Majesty\'s Government for a very much smaller service. One department of Her Majesty\'s Government had been year after year calling out to its agents on their watch-tower, ""Sister Anne, Sister Anne, is there any one coming—any one to place steam navigation on the Niger, and to enable us to redeem those promises we have made, again and again, to the chiefs, the nonfulfilment of which dishonours and disgraces this country?"" At last the hoped-for one appears—appears, in efficient form—appears, fully capable in every way of giving the required aid. And then in step the African merchants to protest against the work being done in the only way in which it can be accomplished. They call upon the Government to stultify itself in all it has been doing for years past. They say, throw away the ten or twenty thousand pounds you have spent on Dr. Baikie and on gunboat expeditions up the river during the last six years. And why, forsooth? For this only reason, as appears by the memorials—this: we cannot and will not eat the hay ourselves, and we will not that others eat of it. This dog in the manger system is nothing new in the world. But that it should have succeeded with the department that holds the purse-strings of the Government and nation, seems to us inexplicable. But alas! such has been the fact. Instead of meeting the opponents with, ""Gentlemen, this navigation of the Niger—this trade in the Niger—has long been a cherished desire of Her Majesty\'s Government; will you undertake it as efficiently as has been proposed to us, and on better terms than have been proposed to us?"" the department says, ""We think you are right—so you will not and cannot eat hay, it would really be very hard that anybody else should be allowed to do so; it would be hard to see others feeding, and the nation rejoicing, where you cannot and will not eat. You are right, gentlemen.

But inasmuch as we are going to incur a very large outlay in the first instance, and as we are willing that it should be open to all, if we succeed, to come up and enjoy the fruits of our enterprise, we say to the Government it is fair that we should have some assistance towards maintaining steam navigation on the River Niger. Surely, if a subsidy can be justified anywhere—if the Cunard subsidy can be justified, where there are independent lines running across the Atlantic without a subsidy—surely for a purpose like this the very small subsidy which we have asked should be granted. And I believe it is likely it will be granted. I am sorry to say that we have met with some opposition from the members of firms engaged in the coast trade.

""African Merchant"" himself must recognize that such retrogression is not practicable, for it would involve leaving the Niger region to the land-grabbing operations of foreigners with a colonization craze. The British Government wished to prevent a foreign protectorate, and they were glad to find persons prepared to save them trouble and expense. They jumped at the offer of the National African Company, and were not too particular about the effect of entrusting the taxing and administrative powers to a party of traders who might be tempted to handicap competitors to secure to themselves a practical monopoly. It is true that the Charter purports to preserve the rights of other traders, but due and licence charges are doing the monopolists\' work on the Niger. What Liverpool merchants ask is that the Charter shall be revoked, and the administrative powers conferred on a non-trading organization. In the present company the dual position of governors and traders is anomalous, and leaves the management open to suspicion. The quotation from the Foreign Office letter suggests that Lord Salisbury has misconceived the desires of independent merchants and traders. They do not wish to return to the old system, but to secure such arrangements as will prevent the trade of the Niger being injured for the benefit of a chartered and limited company. They have established a case for that inquiry which should have preceded the grant of a charter. The incubus is the more galling from the circumstance that authority is conferred on a new company, to the detriment of merchants engaged in the trade of the rivers forming the Niger delta. Before the Government adopted so important a step as chartering one set of traders, they should have obtained the views of merchants who know something of the region in question. So far, the agents of the company do not appear to have achieved any administrative triumphs; their capacity seems to be limited to providing fellow-traders with grievances and driving out of the river the smaller class of traders.

Once again the important districts through which the Niger River flows are condemned to unproductiveness. Once again the work of civilization in the interior of Africa is impeded.

Because of any unwillingness of those departments of Her Majesty\'s Government to whom it appertains to decide what is necessary for the successful accomplishment of a great work in which this country has been many years engaged?

We insert among the Parliamentary proceedings of the month an explanation of the ""why"" this great work in Central Africa has not been proceeded with. The reply of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to some questions put by Lord Elcho explains the matter, on which additional light has since been thrown by the publication of the ""Niger Papers"" laid before Parliament.

Was the blow to the slave-trade which it would give to be no longer thought of? Were barbarism and unproductiveness to be prolonged _ad infinitum_ throughout extensive regions in which a noble river flowed, and with which it was the natural channel of communication? We could not accept this as the worthless result of our labours. It became evident that some other means must be employed. There was but one—a commercial combination that, having other principal operations, would, on certain conditions, make what we wanted in the Niger an accessory. That combination was found in what is now the ""Company of African Merchants."" But their condition of action was necessarily the same as that previously imposed by those who would have made it a principal—viz., Government co-operation, by a subsidy for a limited period. The difference was, however, an essential one. Government aid was no longer required to enable a company to be formed, or to bolster up a company. Here was a powerful body, with an ample subscribed capital, who, though having a profitable field for its full employment elsewhere, were yet ready to treat with the Government on terms of equality for a work which it was everywhere believed the Government were anxious to have performed. They made their proposals to the Government for enabling the latter to achieve what had been long regarded as a great national object, and as indispensable to the spread of Christian civilization in Africa. They did not seek any exclusive advantages. So far from this, they have, we believe, consented to associate another company, the West Africa, with themselves in this noble work. They offered to carry up traders and their goods at fair rates. They offered to repay the Government advances out of profits, should there be profits out of which to repay them. They stated distinctly that if the Government could find any other person or persons to perform the same services for a specific period, such as would alone suffice to solve the problem as to whether the Niger could or could not be made the field of a self-supporting commerce, they were perfectly willing to leave the work in such persons\' hands, without in any way opposing or embarrassing them in their efforts. Would it have been believed that this should have given rise to a virulent and combined opposition on the part of others, not one of whom would come forward for the work, and very few of whom had anything whatever to do with the trade on the Coast within 500 or 1,000 miles of the embouchure of the Niger? And yet such has been the case. We mentioned last month that a deputation of the African trade had been received by Lord Palmerston. The object of that deputation was to oppose any Government grant for the Niger. Since then memorials have followed in the same track. If the Niger cannot be traded in in the same simple way in which trade is carried on with the Coast districts, or in rivers not requiring steam navigation, the Niger, forsooth, ought to be left unnavigated and untraded in. The principle established in the discontinuance of trading consuls has, as we have already stated, been contended for as applicable to this case of the Niger. But surely nothing can be more dissimilar. If the parties opposing the grant, for several of whom we have a personal esteem, had trading establishments up the river, or if they were offering guarantees to the Government that they were about to form and maintain such at their own risk and charge, the principle would apply. But without these it does not apply. Not one in twenty of the opponents could be even indirectly affected by it; and we can only see in the opposition the evidence of that hostility to progress in Africa which declares roads to be unnecessary, which deprecates the establishment of civilization in place of barbarian rule, and which does not hesitate on occasion formally to declare that Africa suits best as she is.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—With reference to my letter of the 29th inst., I am directed by Earl Russell to transmit to you, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty\'s Treasury, copies of further letters addressed by the African Company of Merchants to Viscount Palmerston, with reference to the subsidy which they are desirous of obtaining from Her Majesty\'s Government for the purpose of navigating the river Niger.—I am, &c.,\n\n(Signed) A.

It is well known that the rivers from which palm oil is now exported, to the value of 1,500,000l. per annum, were once the head-quarters of the slave-trade. The palm-oil trade, wherever established on the coast, has driven out the slave-trade. Precisely the same effect will follow when legitimate commerce has been established in the interior; by thus counteracting the slave-trade at its chief source a saving will, ere long, be effected on the West Coast squadron, in comparison with which the subsidy applied for must appear trifling.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But we hope and believe that such an opposition cannot avail to stop the onward march of African civilization and development.

Commerce is only subject there to ordinary expenses and risks. It would be a gross injustice if the assistance of the State were there given to any one individual or body of merchants, placing him or them in a position of advantage in relation with compeers. And the State is not justified in interfering at all, except to preserve order and give protection, wherever trade is thus established.

What we wanted them to embark in was a company for navigation and trade in the River Niger alone. Once we thought we had nearly obtained what we asked for. Some enlightened men would condescend to manage such a company, giving it for adequate compensation the benefit of their African experience, provided the public could be induced to furnish the greater portion of the funds, and that Government would grant a subsidy. This latter was a sine qua non. Without this, nothing could be done. It would take years to develop production and trade, so as to allow of either navigation or trade becoming remunerative.

The proposal to open Central Africa to commerce by the rivers Niger and Chadda embraces philanthropic and national objects as well as commercial; and as it will assuredly be attended with a considerable loss during the time necessary for establishing and developing trade, the directors feel they would not be justified, as regards the shareholders, to embark so large a sum as 80,000l., unless Her Majesty's Government will consent to share the preliminary risk and expense by means of a subsidy for maintaining steam communication on the rivers. In the event of the enterprise ultimately failing, the total loss would scarcely be less than double the subsidy.\n\nThe subsidy applied for is 35,000l., spread over five years, with an undertaking to return the amount out of profits after 6 per cent. on the capital embarked.

No such regulation exists. The Company, as a trader, is as much a ""foreigner"" in the Niger, and is subject to exactly the same restrictions as any other merchant. Disturbed districts may occasionally have to be absolutely closed for administrative reasons; though only one such instance—that of Onitsha—has actually occurred on the Niger since the issue of the charter, more than three years ago.

A free transit river, and especially where the revenue will not permit of coastguard supervision along thousands of miles of river back in a wild and malarious country, must be treated in this respect like a sea coast, where vessels may only communicate with the shore at certain points, although merchants and others may build, trade, or reside where they please on the land.

Many Tanganyikan peasants, who had a much lower level of involvement in money exchanges than their brothers on the Gold Coast, simply sought to abandon cash-crop farming in the years after 1930. In this they were not very successful, because the power of the colonial state was brought in to tilt the scales against what was considered to be a reversion to barbarism. Campaigns to 'grow more crops' were instituted, and bureaucratic sanctions were thinly veiled forms of force for the expansion of acreages in the face of falling prices. This type of campaign was backed not merely by merchants but also by industrialists requiring raw material and by powerful metropolitan organi› zations such as the Empire Cotton Growing Association, which continued to be active in the years after the slump."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': 'and migrant workers and frustrate any sense of class solidarity, it is hardly surprising that rural resistance rarely took a collective form.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': 'Disgruntled workers, organized through informal grass-roots networks, refused to work unless their wages were adjusted. They gathered in front of the main entrance to the port demanding better salaries and working conditions. The colonial governor sent in troops to smash the demonstration and arrest the leaders. At the same time chíbalo workers were used as strike breakers to keep the port going. Quickly the strikes were broken. Even where the employers agreed to pay increases, they often reneged upon them as in the case of the 1919 strike. Nevertheless, despite these reversals and the rise to power of a fascist government, strikes continued after 1926, though less frequently. 96 Perhaps the most bitter port confrontation was the Quinhenta strike in 1933. Port officials and handling companies, suffering the effects of the world depression, decided to reduce the already low wages of wharf workers by between 10 and 30%. This cutback represented five times the amount gained in the 1921 strike. When the announcement was made, workers walked off the job and refused to return after lunch, leaving the port paralysed. Leaders of the strike vowed that they would not return until the cuts were rescinded. Faced with a paralysed port, employers agreed to the demands and port workers returned only to find themselves locked in the port and surrounded by police who forced them to unload all the ships. Thereafter, it was announced that the cuts would not be restored. One Lourenço Marques newspaper captured the anger and frustration on the wharf. \'Workers with empty bellies faced their boss, who, with his full belly, answered them with empty promises.\' 97 As in other parts of Southern and Central Africa, independent churches offered another institutional framework for workers and peasants to vent their hostility against the new social order and the hypocrisy of the established Christian churches. A secret government report noted that the popularity of the separatist churches was due \'both to the racial discrimina› tion within the larger society and the insensitivity of the European missionaries with regard to the natives\'.$^{98}$ As early as 1918 there were seventy-six separatist churches known to be operating in Mozambique.

He pointed out the necessity which existed for additional taxation to meet the deficit, and held out no hopes of any retrenchment in the public service. Anything like direct taxation it was found could not be levied, from the nature of the country and its population. A tax upon wool would have been very unpopular in the Eastern Province, and the only course hinted at in the speech was an increase of the customs duties. This hint was immediately about to be acted upon by those importers who had goods in bond. But Government promptly issued a notice that forbade any imported goods being entered for consumption—in fact, being taken out of bond—until the owners had signed a bond by which they engaged to pay, in addition to the present duty, any further sum upon any article of import which the Parliament might impose during the present session. Considerable excitement was occasioned in the colony by these proceedings. Measures were promptly taken to test their legality before the Supreme Court. The two sitting judges pronounced a strong opinion against the Government on the question, but postponed any decision for three days, in order that the collector of the customs at Cape Town might have an opportunity of communicating with the authorities at Graham\'s Town. On the morning when the case was to be heard a second time an *Extraordinary Gazette* published Act No. 1, 1864, by which the Governor was indemnified for any proceedings which he might have taken; and it was enacted, moreover, that if any action, suit, or proceeding should have been commenced against the officers of customs, either before or after the taking effect of this act, in respect of any act of theirs in obedience to the instructions of the Government, such action, suit, or proceeding should be dismissed, and the defendant or defendants should be entitled to his or their full costs. The import duties were also increased by 25 per cent. Upon the receipt of this *Gazette* the judges decided that they had no longer any alternative in the matter. The law had been passed and promulgated, and though such legislation was ""unjust and tyrannical,"" they were there only to interpret and to enforce the law, and the application must be dismissed with costs. Since then a public meeting had been held, at which resolutions were adopted condemning the passing of the act, embodying the resolution of the house as illegal and unjust, and a petition to the Queen was prepared, praying Her Majesty to withhold her assent to the same. The validity of the proceedings of Parliament had been called in question by two of the members on account of irregularities in convening it, and the Supreme Court having refused an interdict, an action was to be brought to try the question.

Meanwhile, on the 18th April increased duties had been imposed by ordinance of that date, the duty on spirits being thereby raised from 1s. to 2s. 6d. per gallon. The new ordinance was not received at Pram Pram till the 25th April, when it arrived bearing endorsement of the commandant at Accra that the new scale of duties was not to come into operation until the date of the arrival of the new tariff ordinance at Pram Pram. As the ordinance did not arrive at Pram Pram till the 25th April, and the rum had been landed, entered, and gauged on the 23rd, Mr. Selby tendered the 1s. duty, to which alone it seemed clearly liable. This the Customs refused to receive, demanding the 2s. 6d.

The former actually receives, under treaty, annual subsidies from Her Majesty’s Government to keep the peace and protect our traders. They attacked the Prince of Badiboo, burned his towns, and laid waste the whole of one of the best-cultivated and most flourishing districts; the people fled, and dare not return.\n\nThese cases only illustrate a few out of the many outrages which have taken place in the Gambia annually for several years. It must be borne in mind that, besides our paying duties to our own Government, these chiefs levy on our traders and planters heavy taxes, and yet British merchants have to submit to be thus plundered.\n\nThe town of Bathurst is now full of refugees pleading with the Government for help from these robbers. The Administrator, Captain Moloney, does all he can, but he has only a few native police at his disposal, and his powers have been completely withdrawn by the London Colonial Office; however willing to help us, he is under orders to use no force, and he dare not act without authority from England. Even our men-of-war have orders to give no assistance up the river. Although in a British river we are thus openly outraged almost under the eyes of the officials, our laws will not permit us to defend our property and rights; otherwise we could organize a force to put down these robbers. Their influence and power might have been easily suppressed a short time back, but now they are increasing throughout the river, and it will now require a strong force, and unless some steps are taken, they may endeavour to plunder Bathurst and drive the Government into the sea.'}, {'id': 5962, 'article_title': 'The Proposed Charter of the African Association', 'full_section_title': 'The Proposed Charter of the African Association', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1890#article-0', 'issue_date': '01_04_1890', 'content': 'The Chairman stated that he had received a letter from Messrs. Pickering & Berthoud, of Manchester and Liverpool, on the subject. The African Association, it was pointed out, was quite a recent combination of about six Liverpool and Glasgow firms engaged in trade with that part of the West Coast of Africa extending from Benin to Old Calabar, and known as the Oil Rivers. The granting of a charter would tend to seriously hamper legitimate trading, and they need point to no other proof in support of this assertion than the present position of the Royal Niger Company. It was the prohibitive duties introduced by these chartered companies that merchants had most to complain about; and in the case in point a charge of £50 per annum was exacted from everyone wishing to trade. The Niger Trade had been considerably crippled by the Royal Niger Company, and it was due to this that so much agitation was being carried on in Liverpool against a similar monopoly being obtained by the Liverpool African Association, which would push out from the rivers all those who had not accepted the terms offered. Unless some energetic measures were taken, they much feared the Government would be prevailed upon to grant one.\n\nMr. Dean (Messrs. B. Ollivant & Co.) said he was out in Lagos in 1888, and at that time there were rumours that it was intended to extend the power of the Niger Company so as to include the five oil rivers. The native population had a hatred of anything like a chartered company, and the protest of Lagos against the proposal was signed by every merchant whose opinion was of any value.\n\nMr. Jackson (secretary of the African Association), who was called upon by the chairman, said he was simply instructed to say that if the Manchester Chamber of Commerce desired any information from the Company, members of its directorate were willing to come to give it.\n\nMr. Tomlinson (a member of the African Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce) said he had seen an announcement that the Association had withdrawn its application for a charter. He wished to know whether that was so.\n\nMr. Jackson said he could not give an official answer to the question.\n\nMr. J. T. Bradbury (Liverpool) was opposed to the granting of a charter. He said that since the Niger Company had been chartered his firm had been compelled to abandon trade up the river, which they formerly had a steamer of their own to carry on.\n\nMr. Sykes (Manchester) said the object of the charter was to create a monopoly which ought not to exist, and which was entirely opposed to the principles of free trade.\n\nMr. Brunnschweiler said he understood that the trade on the Niger had largely increased since the Niger Company was chartered. (""No, no."" A voice: ""Certainly not in Manchester goods."")\n\nMr. Butterick proposed that in the opinion of this meeting a charter should be granted to the African Association Limited, providing that the interests of other trades were protected.\n\nMr. Blackstock seconded this.'}, {'id': 6662, 'article_title': 'Liverpool and the West African Trade', 'full_section_title': 'Liverpool and the West African Trade', 'last_edit_date': '11-15-1895', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1895#article-0', 'issue_date': '02_12_1895', 'content': 'A letter was read from the Foreign Office, dated Nov. 5,  \ncontaining the following remarks on the points raised by the  \ncommittee with regard to the increase of the duty on spirits,  \n&c., at the Niger Coast Protectorate: (1) The increase will  \ntake effect at all ports throughout the Protectorate from the  \n22nd inst.; (2) the new duty will be charged on all spirits  \ntaken out of bond on and after the date mentioned in the proclamation; (3) consignments of spirits brought into but not  \nlanded at any port of the Protectorate previous to Nov. 22  \nwill, on being landed on or after that date at the port of their  \ndestination, be charged with the increased duty; (4) it is not  \nproposed in regard to duties on spirits and arms and ammunition to adopt any exceptional treatment as regards the latter,  \nexcept such as may apply to them under the provisions of the  \nFirearms Ordinance, 1894.

It is greatly to be deplored that the British local authorities had not shown themselves alive from the first to the impending danger of which they were warned early in December last by the King of Eastern Akim, whose communication was so highly distasteful to the Administrator (see correspondence, p. 126). The result will be, that what might have been effected at very little cost will soon have to be effected somehow or other at a very large one, and with the unnecessary sacrifice of many valuable lives. But to imagine for a moment that such cost, which we ourselves have made necessary, because we were determined to disregard the native warnings, and refuse the native applications for the then trifling amount of aid required—to imagine that such cost can be provided for by the invaded and devastated Territories, deprived too of their Ashanti trade, by raising the duties 150 per cent. on spirits, 250 per cent. on tobacco and powder, 100 per cent. on guns, and 10 per cent. on Manchester and all other goods except provisions, books, newspapers, &c., could, in our opinion, only have entered into the heads of officials who had first been deprived of whatever common sense they might have before possessed. It is said the Cape Coast chest is empty. It ought not to be so; but if it be so, impracticable duties like the above-mentioned will not fill it.

But all this has been disregarded. The Administrator and his Council have laid an enormous war tax egg. True, they astounded Cape Coast and Elmina when they held it up to public gaze in all the pride of authority on the 17th April. But they will never get their expected fowl out of it.

Properly speaking the boundary for customs of the Gold Coast would run therefore on the right bank of the Volta. This measure directs its point against the German Togo district and commerce there. It is to induce the traders in the interior not to send their goods to Togo, but to the English part of the Slave Coast to the left bank of the Volta, where they can get European goods almost free of tax, and therefore much cheaper than in Lome, Klein Popo, Porto Novo, &c. The manufactories on the German side of the Volta are put a great deal to inconvenience, for the intercourse on the Volta and on the borders of their own country is rendered very difficult by endless custom vexations. From the Slave Coast, across the river towards the Gold Coast only products of the country are permitted to be brought. On the Volta are custom boats, which stop every canoe, examine and confiscate the goods if the owner is not carrying an invoice issued by the English Custom office, showing that the goods are bought on the Gold Coast. The whole Customs proceedings on the frontier are of course exceedingly circumstantial and this has excited great discontent among the natives. Haussa soldiers stand on the whole western bank of the Volta.

The Report itself is valuable and instructive reading, and we regret that want of space compels us to pass over much that we should like to reproduce in our columns.\n\n**Revenue and Expenditure.**—The revenue of the Colony is almost entirely derived from a duty of 1s. a gallon on wines and malt liquors and 2s. 6d. a gallon on spirits, and from a 10 per cent. duty upon the principal imports; also specific duties on tobacco, cigars, gunpowder, cartridges, lead, percussion caps, and guns; stamp duties; and a tax upon the sale of liquors.\n\nUntil 1888 there was a duty of 4 per cent. upon all imports with few exceptions. But the Ordinance imposing those duties was repealed in 1887 in favour of an increase in the duties on wine, malt liquors, tobacco and cigars. The revenue at once\n\nfell from £122,350 to £97,806 19s. 5d., and although in 1889 it rose to £105,388, it became patent that the fiscal change was not a success. Hence the reversion to, and an increase of, the previous duty from Jan. 1, 1890.\n\nIn that part of the Protectorate which lies to the eastward of the River Volta the duties upon spirits, tobacco, gunpowder, and guns was, in 1890, reduced, and all merchandise was entirely exempted from duty. It was found that trade was being attracted to the colony of Togoland in consequence of its low import duties, and this reduction was therefore a measure of self defence. It has answered all expectations, the trade at the ports of Ada and Kwitta having increased enormously since the step was taken. From 1892 the duty upon gin, which had eastward of the River Volta been 6d. per gallon, was reduced to 5½d., while the duty on brandy and other spirits was increased from 4d. to 5½d.\n\nThe total revenue of the Colony in the four years has been: 1889, £111,388 6s. 7d.; 1890, £156,449 0s. 10d.; 1891, £186,020 11s. 9d.; 1892, £183,074 11s. 1d.\n\nIt does not appear that the 10 per cent. duty has hampered the trade of the Colony in goods subject to that tax.

In contrast, The African Times news articles provide detailed examples supporting the claim, highlighting instances where import duties and licensing fees were sources of contention. For instance, the imposition of duties on goods imported into the Scarcies River led to disputes with French merchants, and a £100 license fee for trading in spirits by the German Governor in a British territory caused protests among British traders. Additionally, the re-imposition of duties on building materials led to petitions from merchants. These examples illustrate how such policies often led to conflicts and dissatisfaction among traders, reinforcing the notion that they were indeed a source of tension.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In Sierra Leone, the frustration of the educated classes and the African traders, and the unemployed in the big towns was given open expression in the riots of 1919 in which protests against the price of rice took the form of attacks on Syrian and Lebanese traders, and in the workers' strike that same year. Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'African participation in the colonial economy, 1920-30', 'content': ""African peasants were up against the commercial system. The tendency of West African merchant firms to monopolize through 'pools' is well known, and trading companies throughout the continent guarded their interests by refusing to compete in such a way as to raise prices. Indeed, intermediaries such as the 'Asians' in East Africa and the Lebanese in West Africa also set prices and conditions among themselves so that the African peasant had little choice when he went to make his sales. The cash-crop farmer faced the prospect of being gypped at the weighing scales, in the processing stage (as with the cotton ginnery), in transportation, in the calculation of returns and in the repayment of loans or advances where applicable. African producers were also making retail purchases from the middlemen traders and the commercial firms. A fundamental inequality marked the exchange between the colonial economy and the metropolises. This unequal exchange was reflected in the disparity between the low remuneration Africans received and the relatively high cost of manu› factured imports; and it also manifested itself in the low wage rate in the colonies as compared with the metropolises. Of course, unequal exchange was not a purely economic phenomenon. It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

Local artisanship suffered heavily from European competi› tion and manipulation, along lines already manifest in the pre-colonial period. As the colonial economy became firmly rooted in the 1920s, Africans were producing that which they did not consume and consuming that which they did not produce. In effect, domestic demand did not stimulate the maximization of domestic resources. As a further deleterious consequence, the colonizers wasted some African resources and ignored others, because their yardstick was the utility of the given resource to Europe rather than Africa. None of the major economic elements such as savings, investment, prices, incomes and output were correlated in response to domestic require› ments. For these structural reasons, recent research by African economists and historians has challenged the old formulations of colonial development and has posited instead that colonialism produced economic dependence, lopsidedness and underdevelopment. 14 The most significant event in the evolution of African economies in the inter-war period was the great depression of 1929-33.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction.

Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads. Nor were they meant to facilitate inter-African travel and communication. Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts. In the second place, such economic growth as occurred in the colonies was based on the natural resources of the area and this meant therefore that areas not naturally endowed were totally neglected.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

On the whole, coastal areas had had a longer contact with Europeans and Arabs than the interior areas. Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya. This was especially the case against the Nandi.$^{9}$ The Maasai example serves to illustrate the kind of dislocation that had taken place among the economies of various societies in this general area.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work.

Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

The African Committee of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce call attention to certain provisions which, in their judgment, are harassing and vexatious, particularly those with regard to the £2 annual license to be required from all traders, and the clauses forbidding the gifts of spirits to Natives by Europeans.\n\n**PREMPEH REMOVED TO SIERRA LEONE.**—Prempeh, the ex-King of Kumasi, the Queen-mother, his father, and brother, together with the war chiefs Kinos, Manpong, Offisu, and Ogean, and their followers, have been removed from Elmina Castle, where they had been confined since their arrival at the coast after the Ashanti expedition, and taken, on board the steamship Bakana, in charge of an escort of Hamsa, to Sierra Leone. Prempeh, who, at first, seemed to be somewhat alarmed at his sudden removal, soon got to be reconciled to his fate when once he was on board. The chiefs Boatin and Fuku, who were among the Ashanti Envoys in England prior to the British Expedition, left Accra by the same steamer.\n\n**THE CONGO STATE AND THE STOKES INCIDENT.**—We learn that the Congo Government claims 150,000 francs as duty payable on ivory belonging to the murdered Mr. Stokes. As that is exactly the sum paid by the State as compensation for the assassination, Major Lothaire\'s villainies would not cost it a single farthing. To put a man to death without trial, and then to levy heavy duties on his property, savours more of brigandage than of the processes of civilisation. We are not surprised to learn, therefore, that ""relations continue to be strained between Lord Salisbury and the Congo Administration."" The Congo authorities had better beware how they trade upon the assumption that England can be affronted with impunity. They have got it into their heads that we attach very high value to the co-operation of the Dhansis expedition with our forces at Uganda. Of course, it is the interest of both Powers to stand together against the Dervishes on the Upper Nile; but that interest is not so paramount in the case of England as to necessitate submission to insult. Even if it were so there can never be real friendship between Great Britain and the Congo State until the murder of Mr. Stokes is compensated for, so far as compensation can go. To award his relations a certain sum, none too liberal, and forthwith to take it back is a mockery of justice which does not comport with British notions.'}]","[{'document_title': 'TRADE WITH THE GAMBIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. J. F. Hutton said that for years past the Manchester Chamber of Commerce had been in correspondence with the Colonial Office in reference to the West Coast of Africa, and had constantly called attention to the neglect of the authorities to attend to the interests of our trade, and to the responsibilities that ought to be undertaken in connexion with it. This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position. The trade of the district was gradually passing into the hands of the French, from the want of activity and determination on the part of the British authorities. The British traders were being taxed without getting any adequate protection in return. The merchants had no representative on the Council.

From the poverty-stricken condition of the Free State Government, and for political reasons, I fear the duties will not be arranged in anything like a satisfactory manner for the traders, and if the French and Portuguese Governments follow suit, there is no saying where the thing will end; but of this we are certain, a great blow will be given to English enterprise, and we know that neither French nor Portuguese capitalists will put money in these colonies. Belgian capital is out of the question altogether; the Free State seems to be regarded as a hobby or a speculation of the King. How long will it take to open up the Dark Continent to the boasted advantages of civilisation if the pioneers are to be hampered and hindered by the Governments who ought to help them to the utmost?""\n\nIt may be asked why Holland should especially bestir itself in Congo matters more than other nations? The reason is that the Dutch joint-stock company, De Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels Vennootschap, exports seven-eighths of the total produce of the Congo; its shares are in the hands of numerous holders; it is one of the oldest European establishments in that region, and has a character, an organisation, and a prospect higher than it ever previously possessed.\n\nThe duty which Holland is striving to fulfil with respect to her African Trading Company has its counterpart in England. We Englishmen have also compatriots whose history has been similar to that of the Dutch company. Though not possessing such an extensive interest, their establishments are spread over the territory claimed by the Portuguese and the French. These Powers may follow suit if the present encroachments be not resisted, and it behoves our Government to see that our merchants do not suffer through the proposed innovations. But Governments will not, cannot, act unless moved from outside, and the traders of the Congo district thoroughly realise this fact. The export houses have all decided to urge the Powers to ameliorate the present condition of affairs, with a unanimity born of common danger.—R. C.

Or, license duty at 4 frs.; export duty at 2 frs.; total, 6 frs., or about 26⅓ per cent.\n\nWho will not call such duties exorbitant?\n\nThis becomes the more apparent, as ivory is very divergent in value, regulating itself according to the weight of each tusk.\n\nThe tusks weighing over 20 lbs. English, are generally the dearest, then follow those of from 10 to 20 lbs., whilst the cheapest are less than 10 lbs.\n\nDuring the last two years we sold in eight successive sales in London: Tusks of over 20 lbs. English, from 30 frs. to 23 frs. per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram is 13½ to 17½ per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram is 20 to 26 per cent. Tusks from 10 to 20 lbs. English 27,75 frs. to 21,74 frs. per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram is 14⅓ to 18⅓ per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram is 21⅓ to 27⅓ per cent. Tusks below 10 lbs. English 19,75 frs. to 10,80 per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram, is 20 to 37 per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram, is 30 to 55½ per cent.\n\nIt requires no argument to prove that, with such burdens, the ivory trade is impracticable to the Congo trader. The buying is done in small lots at a time. He who purchases a lot of small ivory is by no means sure of securing large ivory later on. The negro will no longer be able to barter the article for goods. The contact with Europeans will decrease, and the trader will find a fresh field for his operations, and will acquire his ivory on easier terms and find other means of cheap transit to the East Coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Plenty of literature respecting the commercial and political condition of the Congo Free State is in existence for the information of those who will take the trouble to read it. Those who do will not be long in discovering that there is a great deal of private discontent among the traders of the great river basin. One cannot expect that merchants who have established themselves in a locality on the faith of certain promised conditions which they consider favourable, will remain silent when they see important clauses in those conditions treated one after another as so much waste paper. The export trade of the Congo State in 1889 reached a value of £172,000. According to the new scale of duties announced in the eighth official bulletin, such a body of merchandise would now be subject to impost duties amounting to £56,845, or something like a third of its value. It is impossible to evade the direct consequence which must manifest itself in higher prices to the consumer of the produce, and this must either constrict the scope of the shipper’s operations, or seriously retard its development. It has been loudly asserted that the real progress of the Congo region began with the founding of the State in 1885. The figures used to support this statement should be calmly examined from more than one side. Taking as a possibly typical instance the last ten balance-sheets of the Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels-Venoothschap, trading between the river and Rotterdam, we find that from a dividend of 28 per cent. in 1880, the profits declined, by irregular graduations, to nothing at all in 1885. In 1887 the Company began to pay again, and a 9 per cent. dividend in that year was followed by one of 5 per cent. in 1888, and another of 13 per cent. last year. A statistical writer, however, calls the attention of those who may read these figures to the fact that the biggest cost of recent years have not been without their influence on balance sheets. It is a fact that good trade will assert itself in spite of taxes and duties, the vagaries of monetary ratios, or any other commercial bugbears.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established. The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district. The ""customs"" have been abolished, a uniform export duty of 2s. 6d. per ton being levied instead. As things stand, we make no pretence to the sovereignty of the country; we only constitute ourselves the final authority in matters of dispute between the natives and traders of whatever nationality, and debar our continental neighbours from proclaiming themselves masters of the country. Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce.

As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Political Troubles on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British and African steamer Opobo, with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa, arrived at Liverpool a short time since.

At Salt Pond trade was at a standstill, owing to fighting going on a few miles from the coast. The trouble was between the tribes in the interior, those on the sea-coast, and the natives known as the ""middlemen."" Both parties were desirous of direct intercourse, which the ""middlemen"" natives were doing all they could to prevent. The effect was that business was stopped, and several encounters had taken place. The war in the Ashantee country showed no signs of abatement.\n\nAffairs in the Cameroons are in a very unsatisfactory state. It is said that the natives have boycotted all the whites, and refused to trade with them or supply them with food. No white man can buy a fowl or a bullock, and the natives have barred the way to the fresh water, so that the whites have to depend upon rain for all the water they require. Large numbers of the factories up the river are closed, and the traders are sending their working staffs home. The natives are determined that the German Government shall derive no advantages from the port. They are paying up all the debts they owe to the white traders, but are doing no fresh business.

Their houses as well as their plantations were all destroyed when the Germans bombarded the town, so that they have nothing to lose.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description.

He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MANUFACTURERS IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Mr. Alvan Millson, Assistant Colonial Secretary, Colony of Lagos, delivered an address in the Manchester Chamber of Commerce rooms on June 5th, on the Commerce and Industries of the Yoruba country.

These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation', 'content': ""Immanuel Wallerstein has seen this war of the traders as one of the decisive events of early colonialism: 'Many parts of sub-Saharan Africa ...

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

At this time, trade in slaves (which had not been prominent under the Kamba) seems to have become more important. Kamba traditions picture this as the most disruptive period in their history: disruptive famine led to inter-lineage conflicts that were used by ambitious members of society to sell weaker ones to Arabs.$^{17}$ Kamba traditions, therefore, rightly indicate the relationship between the decline of trade in goods in which they themselves played a major part and the rise of the system of profiteering in persons in which the Arabs and Swahili traders played a prominent role.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sahara in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Desert trade and the nomads', 'content': 'Changes in European military technology accelerated in the latter half of the nineteenth century, with the result that European forces, armed with the latest weapons, faced opponents with outdated arms. Technological change did not only permit the conquest of the desert; it also transformed the economic life of the Sahara, as the manufacture of cheap products permitted a new phase of European penetration. Trade with Europe had existed before, but the nineteenth century witnessed a massive increase in the scale of this trade with varying effects depending on the structure of Saharan regional economies. For example, the cotton goods industry of Morocco, which had trans-Atlas outlets, succumbed after i860 to the competition of Manchester cotton goods, while the woollen textile industry of southern Tunisia fared much better and continued to feed products into trans-Saharan networks.$^{18}$ On the fringe of the Sahara various groups involved themselves in exports of primary products. For example north of the Senegal basin increased exports of gum arabic allowed a zawiya lineage, whose members specialized in Islamic scholarship and the mediation of disputes and organized trading caravans to escales on the Senegal river to gain in power and influence.19 In the area north of the Sokoto caliphate the rise ofexports ofostrich feathers and tanned goat skins in the last thirty years of the century forced nomadic ruling classes to adjust to the new¬ found ability of peasants and servile agriculturalists to earn income from collecting and selling these products.20 European economic penetration also affected the tastes of consumers, so that the custom of drinking heavily sugared tea spread during the century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'European trading influence spread much more quickly and more widely than missionary influence in the first half of the nineteenth century. This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation', 'content': ""I began this chapter by describing the situation in the last twenty years of the nineteenth century. Yet it has proved extremely difficult in practice to discuss resistance within this chronological limitation. At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'.

The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': ""It is important not to exaggerate the extent of European power in Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century, or the rate at which Europeans acquired 'possessions' or penetrated inland before 1850.

In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials.

The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture.

More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront.

This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

I called the interpreter, and when he came, talked in Bakwelli, that the people might hear a little, and said: ""They knew we were in a hurry. I had told them we wanted to get back quickly. My friend was leaving Victoria for England. If we went straight to Ekumbi, we had time, but if we were delayed to go to Balundu first, we might be too late; so I wished to propose that our friend and host should send to Balundu to inform Balundu people and Yellow that the white man had been there, and wanted to go to Ekumbi; that they had wished him to come to Balundu first, but the white man was in a hurry, so he returned; but he wished them to send word to his friend on the beach if the Balundu people had no objection to his going to Ekumbi, and he would return with his brother missionary, and have plenty of time to visit all the country. That we did not want to trade, but to see the country only."" This pleased the people, and perfectly satisfied my interpreter. One thing only was asked: a bit of paper to carry to Yellow to show that the white man had really sent the message.

The *Cape Times* hears that Captain Matthews, R.N., who has command of the Sultan\'s troops, has proceeded to the mainland with 600 men. This force will construct a series of forts to keep Mirambo\'s army in check, and to prevent his aggressions upon Europeans passing through his country.\n\nThe Rev. J. O. Whitehouse, the acting foreign secretary of the London Missionary Society, writes as follows: ""A letter has recently been made public through the daily press giving an account of the much lamented death of Captain Carter and Mr. Cadenhead, and expressing the belief that the situation of the members of the Belgian Expedition and of the missionaries at Urambo (Mirambo\'s town) is very critical. By the mail from Zanzibar on the 14th inst., letters were received from Dr. Southon, this Society\'s missionary residing at Urambo, which enclosed his journal, which gives a full and carefully-prepared narrative of his interview with Mirambo on the subject of the death of these gentlemen, and also of the statement made to him by Captain Carter\'s servant, who had been brought by Mirambo to his town."" Mr. Whitehouse forwards an extract from Dr. Southon\'s journal which is too long for publication, but the purport of which is reassuring as regards the attitude of Mirambo towards the white men in the country. Speaking at a meeting at Manchester, the Rev. E. H. Jones, Secretary of the London Missionary Society, said that the latest communications from Dr. Southon, medical missionary in the territory of the African chief, Mirambo, caused him to fear that Mirambo\'s people were concerned in the deaths of Messrs. Carter and Arkenhead, of the Belgian Exploration Expedition. At the date of the letter Mirambo was away from his capital, with 6,000 or 7,000 fighting men and a good deal of gunpowder.

In this I found two coloured crystals, and though I was not able to measure the angles, not having a goniometer, I am persuaded that we may find garnets and rubies. There was one piece found in some washings which was reported to be a diamond, and was said to scratch glass; but I did not see it myself. There is so much hard crystal that has not got the right number of sides, or the right number of angles, though it will cut glass, that one cannot be sure of this; and as I did not see it, I cannot say much about it, but I have a strong idea precious stones will be found. If you look at the end of one of these pieces of quartz, you will see how straight the cleft has gone.

Originally a slave of the King of Bonny, he emancipated himself, fought for and obtained the independence of Opobo, has since amassed considerable wealth, is a man of liberal ideas, and his territory is certainly more advanced and civilized than that of any of the other native potentates in this part of the world. Ja Ja is a man of extremely fine physique, speaks English fluently, has a keen sense of humour, a fair knowledge of logic, and is essentially a man of business. He is stated to be cruel, and his face, when not lighted up by a smile, certainly looks harsh and unfeeling; but it must be recollected that what is termed cruelty in England is a characteristic of every African ruler, and the ruled take good care they do not have any one but a strong man over them, as weakness or leniency in these parts inevitably leads to anarchy and internal dissensions. Ja Ja is stated by the traders here to have sacrificed a human being daily for some weeks previous to our arrival, to propitiate his gods. This may or may not be true, but even if it were, it must be recollected that human sacrifices and the eating of human flesh are, unfortunately, not quite extinct in even this, the most civilized of West African monarchies.\n\nWhen every one was present and seated on the upper deck of the *Watchful*, the Consul commenced the ""palaver"" by stating that he had summoned the kings and chiefs of Opobo and the European traders in the first place to investigate a complaint contained in a letter written by the King to the late Foreign Secretary, the Marquis of Salisbury, to the effect that the traders in the river had, in defiance of his treaty with the Queen, proceeded to the interior of his country to trade direct with the oil markets. The traders admitted the truth of this complaint, but stated they had been compelled to do so in consequence of the badness of trade; that the Berlin Treaty guaranteed perfect freedom of trade in all rivers and territories in West Africa under British protection; and that as Ja Ja was trading direct with England, and the English market, by ship...'}]","[{'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established. The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district. The ""customs"" have been abolished, a uniform export duty of 2s. 6d. per ton being levied instead. As things stand, we make no pretence to the sovereignty of the country; we only constitute ourselves the final authority in matters of dispute between the natives and traders of whatever nationality, and debar our continental neighbours from proclaiming themselves masters of the country. Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce.

The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey.""

They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites.

Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

Unfortunately, the traders and merchants considered that the independence of the chiefs was more for their benefit than the establishment of British rule; that the influence of the British Consul, backed up by an occasional gunboat, was sufficient to prevent any serious difficulties; and that the treaties with the chiefs secured trade on profitable and equitable terms.\n\nUnder the old régime large fortunes were made, but competition has now much reduced the profits, while German and French annexations have closed some districts to Englishmen and seriously injured their interests in others. In the days that were gone, the courts of equity, formed of the principal merchants, used, with the assistance of the British Consul or the captain of a man-of-war, to smooth all local disputes, settle prices, and generally make regulations for the conduct of trade. Whilst all the merchants were English this system acted very well, although no doubt at times considerable difficulties arose.\n\nForeign competition has sprung up now to a very considerable extent, most of it being in the hands of Germans, and the way that the trade has passed into their hands is not creditable to the foresight or patriotism of English merchants. Even when trade was conducted at more remunerative rates than at present, the scale of pay to clerks and subordinates was not sufficiently high to induce men of education and standing to face the risks of the African climate, and separate themselves from their families and the comforts of civilization for lengthened periods; and in consequence, among those who went to the coast, there were some men whose ideas of commercial morality were at a very low ebb.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Present Depression in all Branches of African Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Yet the Government is not alone to blame. Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed.

We say their export, because their palm-oil is not produced at Benin, Brass, Bonny, Opobo, Old and New Calabar, and Cameroons, but is procured from interior countries, and merely brought to the above-named places for sale and shipment. The natives of these oil-exporting towns go up with their slaves to the interior, carrying manufactured goods, gunpowder, rum, and other desired commodities, which they there exchange with the interior people for oil, to be brought down by themselves to the coast.

They have systematically opposed every effort of the European or even educated African merchant and trader to establish commercial or other relations with the interior. They seal this up, as it were, from the intrusion of civilization and Christianity, in order that they may preserve their monopoly of trade. In the same way that, previous to 1835, they monopolized the supply of slaves to the ships of the odious foreign slavetraders, so do they now monopolize all trade relations with the interior.

Livingstone and Stanley had been busily occupied filling up the map. The secret of the source of the Niger had long been known, and the river itself had been left, in the main, to numerous private traders, who had competed keenly one with another. In 1879 the whole of the English firms doing business on the river coalesced and formed one large company, under the name of the United or National African Company. This combination was a part, and no small part, of the new European movement in Africa. It was formed to combat foreign competition, which had been growing at a rate that augured badly for British interests if resources and efforts remained divided. In this connexion, and in illustration of the view that Africa is being at last treated as a continent, as a theatre of empire and a means of national aggrandisement, Mr. Lucas notes what European peoples were once strong in Africa, and who are they that now prevail.\n\n""The Portuguese,"" he says, ""are still there, but with only a shadow of their former strength; the English are there; the French are there. One European Power, the Dutch, for many years the strongest of all, has now no place at all in Africa, though the Dutch race is perpetuated in the south, under English or Republican Government. On the other hand, the Germans, who, except for the few years when the Brandenburghers traded on the Guinea Coast, never had any footing in Africa, have lately taken a prominent position among the Europeans who are in so lordly a manner slicing up the continent. The Dutch were, above all others, a trading and carrying people. They went to Africa—at any rate, to West Africa—as carriers, and when the carrying trade over the Atlantic came to an end their connexions with West Africa gradually died away. Weak as Holland is when compared with Great Britain, or France, or Germany, she still holds her East Indian and West Indian possessions; but since West Africa has ceased to be what she once was, the scene of a series of depôts from which ships fetched human wares, she has left the Guinea Coast apparently for ever. Meanwhile, a new Power—Germany—has made its appearance. The Germans, no doubt, like all other peoples, look in their colonial enterprises to securing trade for the mother country; but they have taken their place in Africa under, and in full harmony with, the new set of conditions. They have come there as a continental people to a continent, not as a sea-going merchant people to a coast. They have come, not like the Prussians of old, to build and hold on sufferance small factories, but to rule, or claim to rule, to protect, or claim to protect, large areas of territory.

The seaboard of the Niger and Cross river deltas extends about 400 miles from Leckie, the late frontier of the British colony of Lagos, to the German frontier on the Rio del Rey. At the mouths of seven of the so-called ""oil rivers""—viz., Benin, Brass, New Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, Quaebo, and Old Calabar—British traders have carried on trade with the races of the coast. These tribes act as middlemen between the British merchants and the producing tribes of the interior, and must absorb a large share of the profits of the trade. It is an example of the lethargy into which long-established trades are apt to fall, that, until quite recently, no effort has been made by any of the ""oil river"" merchants to break down the monopoly of the middlemen and to penetrate into the interior. The black middlemen of the rivers Benin, Bonny, Opobo, Macebo, and Old Calabar draw their produce from regions untapped by the main Niger and its affluents.

These Brass men were, until recently, the terror of the inhabitants of the lower river, and often turned the cannon which they managed to obtain on the steamers of the enterprising firms who were opening up their insignificant river.

At first sight there may appear nothing of importance in all this; but a glance at the map will show that it is a serious step towards the barring out of British trade with that part of the interior of Africa.\n\nAs far back as 1849 one of the most energetic and far-seeing of the Governors of the Gambia—the late Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell—writing to Earl Grey on his travels in Bondou, a fertile territory between the Upper Gambia and Senegal, says: ""I had frequent interviews with the Almamy, or the Mohammedan Sovereign of Bondou, and was successful in inducing him to enter into an agreement to protect travellers through his country to the Gambia, on receiving certain annual presents from the merchants. I was also equally successful in making a similar agreement with the King of Woolli—both which agreements subsist to this day, and, on the whole, have been as faithfully observed by the two kings as could reasonably be expected. I was fortunate enough to prevent at that period the Almamy\'s ratifying a treaty with the French, whereby he was to bind himself to \'shut the roads,\' as it is called, against the \'coffles,\' or country caravans, proceeding from the neighbourhood of the Senegal to the Gambia through his dominions. I actually met in the interior the gentleman sent by the French Government from St. Louis to Bondou for the above purpose, as is mentioned by one of them in the published narrative of their travels.""

It is now announced that the British Government will recommend Parliament to grant a subsidy to a contractor who is prepared to lay and work a cable between St. Vincent and the chief places on the West Coast. We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

The textbook highlights how colonialism dismantled inter-African trade networks, reorienting commerce towards metropolitan countries and disrupting longstanding commercial relations. This shift, coupled with the abolition of the slave trade and the transition to export agriculture, led to internal conflicts and self-destruction among trading factions, further destabilizing trade. Indigenous trading communities, reliant on European arms and intermediaries, became vulnerable, exacerbating tensions. The textbook also cites the 1919 riots in Sierra Leone as a protest against colonial economic management, underscoring the impact of political disturbances on economic activities. Similarly, The African Times articles detail specific instances where trade was halted due to conflicts, such as the stoppage at Brass and the dull trade in the Cameroons due to local disagreements. They also describe the closure of trade routes in Lagos and disruptions in Salt Pond due to tribal conflicts, leading to depressed trade, falling export values, and merchants struggling without adequate protection.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward.

Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend. Silks and carpets from Turkey and Tripoli, natron from Borno, and Hausa textiles, were exchanged for kola nuts, gold, cotton materials from Dagomba, Mossi and Mande, shea butter and livestock from the Sudanese Sahel."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

These covered a large part of Tanzania and, on a smaller scale, western Kenya. Traditional rulers who were able to control the trade were also able to accumulate the imported goods with which to build up a large army and to expand administrative machinery. Weaker states were either raided for slaves or annexed to form larger entities. In these areas the effect was either constructive in that it enabled certain rulers to build up bigger kingdoms in areas previously supporting smaller states, or destructive in the sense that it encouraged rebellion, which in turn destroyed the unity of the states that existed. Despite this generalization, the effect of the long-distance trade was generally destructive. There is no need to detail here the evils of the trade in human beings. But even the value of the material base built on imported goods was deceptive. Most of these goods were luxury items: beads, bracelets and other ornaments. What was useful was cloth, but even this competed with local sources of production which were eventually destroyed. Worse still, the trade in luxury goods and the general violence caused by the need to raid other societies in order to maintain the trade, meant neglect of subsistence agriculture. It is unlikely that the new structure could have been maintained even if colonialism had not intervened. In fact few of the large states built up during this period survived intact to the 1890s.\nIn order to illustrate this general picture it will be necessary to look briefly at the three caravan-route regions. In discussing the Kamba, we noticed how even their control of trade declined when raiding for slaves became prominent. The Kamba were a non-centralized society. The long› distance trade probably encouraged an enlargement of scale of various traditional institutions, beginning with kinship, village age-group and defence organizations. But none of these became the basis for a centralized state structure. In the whole of Kenya, only in the western region did the coastal trade lead directly to an enlarged and centralized political system.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

When rubber prices plummetted, both Portuguese merchants and a new wave of poor whites ... arrived to establish themselves in commerce.' In the opinion of the most recent study of the Bailundu war of 1902, resentment at this European trade aggression had a great deal to do with the massive popular uprising which broke out against the Portuguese. 44 But in general historians of resistance who work from the economic per› spective associate mass revolt not with resentment at the European attack on trade, but with the more slowly developing realization on the part of African populations that the whites were determined to obtain cheap labour. Many Africans might at first welcome the Europeans as protectors against over-demanding chiefs, or rapacious Swahili traders, or slave-masters. But they very soon discovered that European demands upon them were equally, if not more, intolerable.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Minerals', 'content': 'The export sectors of the countries under discussion had two major characteristics.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history.

For the last ten years the exports of Sierra Leone have kept pretty steadily at about £580,000; in 1876 they sank to £297,000, and in 1882 and 1883 rose to £420,000 and £442,000. Gambia shows considerably more variation; in 1875, the exports were valued at £147,465, sinking to £86,000 in 1876, and, with intermediate fluctuations, reaching £254,711 in 1882.

It amounted to £137,017 1s. 4d. as compared with £115,317 9s. 6d. in 1893, showing an increase of £21,699 11s. 10d. Customs receipts showed an increase of £15,590 14s. 2d., as compared with the previous year, and licenses an increase of £5,206 4s. 5d. The estimated expenditure amounted to £106,825 1s. 4d., and the sum actually disbursed to £124,829 6s. 4d., showing an excess of £18,004 5s. This excess was mainly due to expenditure in public works, also to the large increase of the constabulary force, which was found essential, owing to the active interior policy pursued which has necessitated the establishment of military posts in the hinterland. Notwithstanding the increased expenditure, there still remained a surplus of £12,187 15s.\n\nThe statement of assets and liabilities shows a balance in favour of the Colony, at the end of 1894, of £48,857 17s. 7d. as compared with £36,670 2s. 6d. at the close of 1893 and £26,253 17s. 7d. at the end of 1892.\n\nThe estimated expenditure under the head of Public Works amounted to £8,035, and that expended to £4,124 12s., a saving of £3,910 8s.\n\nThe total vote for “Public Works Extraordinary” amounted to £27,140 12s. 10d., the sum expended to £35,925 0s. 1d.—an excess of £8,784 7s. 3d. £4,907 5s. 9d. was spent on roads to the interior, and opening up and clearing waterways. There are now two good roads from the Ejinrin and Epe markets to Jehu Ode (19 miles and 22 miles). It is possible to use carriages on both roads, which two years ago were simply ruts; showing the advance that has been made since the Jebu War of 1892.\n\nThe Yewa River in the Western District, on the banks of which coffee plantations have been established, has been so cleaned that launches can now go where two years ago canoes were unable to be used owing to the thick growth of weed on the water.\n\nThe general Imports into the Colony show a slight decrease in value as compared with 1893; but this is not surprising, considering 1893 was exceptional owing to the stoppage of trade in 1892 through hostilities with the neighboring tribes. In 1894 the total value of imports amounted to £744,561 as compared with £749,027 in 1893—a decrease of £4,466; but the customs duties show an increase of £15,590 as compared with 1893.\n\nThe Exports also show a slight decrease. In 1893 the total value was £836,295, against £821,682 in 1894—a falling off of £14,613.

The effect was that business was stopped, and several encounters had taken place.

It is said that the natives have boycotted all the whites, and refused to trade with them or supply them with food. No white man can buy a fowl or a bullock, and the natives have barred the way to the fresh water, so that the whites have to depend upon rain for all the water they require. Large numbers of the factories up the river are closed, and the traders are sending their working staffs home. The natives are determined that the German Government shall derive no advantages from the port. They are paying up all the debts they owe to the white traders, but are doing no fresh business. The people on both sides of the river have joined together, and made common cause against the Government. They do not threaten, nor will they fight, but they will not work. Their houses as well as their plantations were all destroyed when the Germans bombarded the town, so that they have nothing to lose.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position.

These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands.

The continual wars led to slave catching, and the result was that the trade routes to the interior were, with few exceptions, closed to traffic, and it was more difficult for a trader to penetrate beyond the coast line than for a Mohammedan to traverse the desert of Sahara.

A Royal Commission has been appointed to inquire into the causes of depression in trade. The causes of the depression in African trade are not far to seek, and the remedies must be applied by the Government, and not by the merchants.

Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed.

The article in question says:—\n\nOne of the ways in which the development of trade must be carried out is by pushing factories up beyond the tribes who now serve as middlemen between the European trader and the native producer. Some difficulty will no doubt be encountered in passing through the unhealthy and malarious districts in which these middlemen live, but the improved knowledge we are obtaining of how to combat climatic diseases will render such an enterprise more easy than it would have been twenty years ago. Indeed, if we contrast the early reports of the Niger with its present exploitation, we may believe that the climate of no tropical country will permanently prevent its being opened up to commerce. This is a ray of hope for our African traders, and it is to be hoped that our Government will enable them to avail themselves of it speedily, and not allow them to be forestalled by the merchants of other nations. As if the inaction of our Government had not been sufficiently disastrous to the trade of the African merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, the home legislation of the last few years has also done much to hamper their enterprise. One industry alone, which, though it may be considered a small one, came in the aggregate to a considerable amount, has been completely driven out of the country. The trade in matches to the West Coast used to be supplied by Manchester. Now, the children who used to be employed in their manufacture are sent to school hungry, while German matches are sent in German ships to those who used to buy the English ones, and the only profit to English people is that of the middleman, and even that is being rapidly taken from them.\n\nThe German and French textile manufactures are also running us close, and we have to watch carefully the change of fashions and ideas among the natives. Many cheap articles made in France, with a ready sale on the coast, could easily be made in England.

Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain and Portugal in East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'all traffic with them forbidden, as in the case of the populous towns of Onitsha, Idah, &c., as in them there would have been competition of other merchants.""

There were several such hold-ups in the Gold Coast where cocoa farmers were substan› tially exposed to international market forces. The most serious cocoa hold› up, between October and December 1930, has been described as 'an economic strike for higher prices' and was 'directed against the large expatriate buying firms and their monopoly control' over the Gold Coast economy.$^{79}$ In addition to withholding their cocoa, Gold Coasters boy› cotted European goods. Arrests were made and fines imposed by chiefs to maintain the hold-up. The effectiveness of the movement threatened the very foundation of colonial economic relations, as the colonial govern› ment, like the expatriate firms, depended on the cocoa trade for its revenue. Evidently the movement was against the interests of both sides. Accord› ingly, the colonial administration broke the movement by force, fining and imprisoning chiefs who supported the hold-up.$^{80}$ During the 1937/8 cocoa season another big hold-up was staged against the most important cocoa exporting firms which had formed an agreement to buy cocoa at a fixed maximum price. This time, the hold-up was extended to Western Nigeria, and it ended only with the intervention of the British government. A commission of enquiry headed by Nowell$^{81}$ revealed that the marketing system, which involved thousands of intermediaries, was both inefficient and wasteful, and was disadvantageous to both the producers in West Africa and the consumers in Western Europe.\nThe United Africa Company (UAC), an amalgamation of many former British firms, was the most prominent and most powerful firm in West African trade after 1920.

Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances.

He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided.

The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward.

Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another negative impact of colonialism in the political field was the mentality that it created among Africans that government and all public property belonged not to the people but rather to the white colonial rulers and could and should therefore be taken advantage of at the least oppor› tunity.

For instance, NguniKhoisan clashes were frequent, especially in the area between the Upper Kei and the Amathole to the north-west of the Transkei.$^{8}$ Conflicts were usually sparked off by the stock-raiding activities of the San, which pro› voked reprisal raids by the Nguni. It must be said, however, that such conflicts, whether between the Nguni and the Khoisan, or between Nguni chiefdoms, were usually fairly localized and controlled.\nThe so-called eastern frontier of the Cape was, however, a zone of blackwhite tension and often open conflict, and for this several factors were responsible. First, it must be borne in mind that for centuries Ngunispeaking communities had been slowly moving south-westwards from the Natal area. On the other hand white expansion in the opposite direction had been taking place since 1652, when Jan van Riebeeck founded a Dutch settlement at the Cape. The two movements were bound to clash somewhere. They clashed in what South African historiography used to refer to as 'Kaffir Wars'.\nSecondly, the Fish river, although recognized by the Cape government as the boundary, was often violated by the people whom it was meant to separate and keep apart. The colonists, especially cattle-farmers, violated it in search of grazing. The Africans, on the other hand, had never had any intention of recognizing, let alone respecting, this boundary, because when it was proclaimed by the Cape government many Xhosa communities had long been established along the Fish river and to the west of it. The frontier zone was regarded by many Xhosa as part of their ancestral lands of which they had been deprived by the ever-expanding Colony. For this reason, therefore, many Xhosa continued to graze and water their herds across the Fish and in defiance of the Cape government.

Even where the employers agreed to pay increases, they often reneged upon them as in the case of the 1919 strike. Nevertheless, despite these reversals and the rise to power of a fascist government, strikes continued after 1926, though less frequently. 96 Perhaps the most bitter port confrontation was the Quinhenta strike in 1933. Port officials and handling companies, suffering the effects of the world depression, decided to reduce the already low wages of wharf workers by between 10 and 30%. This cutback represented five times the amount gained in the 1921 strike. When the announcement was made, workers walked off the job and refused to return after lunch, leaving the port paralysed. Leaders of the strike vowed that they would not return until the cuts were rescinded. Faced with a paralysed port, employers agreed to the demands and port workers returned only to find themselves locked in the port and surrounded by police who forced them to unload all the ships. Thereafter, it was announced that the cuts would not be restored. One Lourenço Marques newspaper captured the anger and frustration on the wharf. \'Workers with empty bellies faced their boss, who, with his full belly, answered them with empty promises.\' 97 As in other parts of Southern and Central Africa, independent churches offered another institutional framework for workers and peasants to vent their hostility against the new social order and the hypocrisy of the established Christian churches.

The British jurisdiction extends over a territory of about 6,000 square inches, and a population computed at about 275,000 natives. The trade of the Gold Coast has doubled during the last ten years. In 1871, the imports, according to the Gold Coast Customs returns, amounted to 250,000l., and the exports to 378,000l.; but according to the British Customs Blue Book, the exports from this country alone amounted to 477,000l.

They complain bitterly of the ordinances passed by the Council in which only one of their members has a voice.

The frequency of change is inseparable from the hardness of the labour, if conscientious, and from the doubtfulness of the reward, if ever so fairly won. With every new governor is inaugurated a new code of legislation and administration. One governor lands imbued with a spirit of centralisation, another is moved by the generous convictions of a spirit of decentralisation. One governor establishes municipal corporations, another demolishes them; one founds hospitals, another roots them out. And so this incessant introduction of new devices in the government of the settlements, at a pause of about every eighteen months, brings the Executive sagacity into contempt, and conveys to the minds of the most loyal chiefs a distrust in the power of the Government to entertain and to succeed in the maturing of any definite idea relative to the development of commercial or social reforms. The injunctions of the Government are, therefore, generally treated with indifference; not from a disloyal or refractory motive, but from a suspicion that the wisdom of the Government of to-day may be utterly tabooed by the wisdom of the Government of to-morrow.\n\n2. The Government is faulty by reason of the scandals involved in the miserable squabbles which are always distracting its own officers from their legitimate duties, and by reason of the petty wars which are perpetually festering between the Government and the tribes who live under its flag, and between the tribes whose country is conterminous to the Protectorate.\n\nThe palm oil trade has been well-nigh obliterated from the ledgers of the merchants at Accra, on account of the monstrous fine of 8,000l. imposed on the Croboes in 1858, and the trade of Cape Coast has followed suit by being paralysed by our last broil with the Ashantees.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1868#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Further Troubles on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The British and African Steam Navigation Company's royal mail steamer Calabar, Captain W.

When the Calabar left Accra there were apprehensions of serious disturbances in the Gold Coast capital, owing to the presence of about 2,000 armed Adanquah men. It seems that the followers of the King of Adanquah have been impeding the trade route from the interior. The Governor of the Gold Coast sent word to the King, requesting his attendance at Accra, allowing him to bring an escort of 200 men. The King arrived, but instead of 200 men he had 2,000 followers, all of them well armed. The British Governor was scarcely prepared for this, and there was naturally some uneasiness in the settlement at the presence of these men, as it was feared they would come in contact with the natives of the British settlement. The only British man-of-war near at the time the Calabar passed was the Express. She was lying at anchor at Accra, but her machinery was out of order, and she could not then move from her anchorage. The Adanquahs were scattered all over the town, and had also got into Christiansborg. It was said that even amongst the British officials a good deal of uneasiness existed, owing to the presence of the men; and the Governor had refused to give subsistence money to more than the 200 he had allowed the King to bring.\n\nAt Winnebah there was also a good deal of uneasiness. Winnebah is one of the Gold Coast ports. One of the inhabitants had been sentenced to be hanged, and the sentence was to be carried out two days after the Calabar left. There are factions in the town, and the class to which the condemned man belonged had vowed their intention of rising against another faction, to which the murdered man belonged, if the sentence of hanging was carried out. It was the intention of the authorities to carry out the sentence, and it was expected that serious trouble would arise.\n\nFrom Sherbro' disquieting news was also received. Captain Hay, the English official, had gone up the Sherbro' River with about 150 men to try and bring about a peaceful termination of the matter. The Sulymiah district, in the same vicinity, was also disturbed, and Captain Hay intended to visit that place also. His escort consisted of a portion of the 1st West India Regiment and some native police. Trade had been stopped owing to the disturbances in Sherbro'.

With reference to the memorial from the mercantile community of the Gold Coast, urging the need of keeping open the trade routes to the interior, with particular reference to the action of the people of Sefwhi, Her Majesty's Government have consented that the Sefwhi country should, on certain conditions, be included in the British Protectorate on the Gold Coast. Captain Lonsdale has been sent up to Sefwhi to arrange with the King and people for their being taken under British protection. The condition will, of course, be imposed that they should refrain from interfering with traders, and give free and unrestricted intercourse through their country. With reference to the complaints of delay on the part of the Governor in replying to the despatch from Colonel Stanley as to the condition of Coomassie, Sir H. Holland says that Colonel Stanley approved of the postponement of the despatch of an officer to Coomassie. There might be a large staff of officials in the Colony, but the Governor might not have at his disposal a suitable man for such a mission. To appoint an officer not possessing the necessary qualifications would be to risk a serious failure, and an aggravation of the evils it was desired to remove. Sir Henry Holland is most anxious that trade in the West African colonies should be fostered and developed, nor can he doubt that the Governors of those colonies share his anxiety to promote that object. He must express his dissent from the opinion of the Chamber that there has been apathy on the part of the Gold Coast Government in dealing with these matters. The task of maintaining peace and order in the interior, and securing freedom of trade, necessitates tedious and troublesome negotiations, which, owing to the jealousies and differences amongst the various tribes, require to be conducted with much tact and delicacy.

During the past three weeks we have had two very distinct and sharpish shocks of earthquake. They were very sensibly felt at this place, notwithstanding the heavy roaring of the surf against the rocks on our coast. We have, too, a drought, which will soon have lasted three months, not a quarter of an inch of rain having fallen during that time. This drought has been attended by occasional intense heats in the day, and sultry nights. Native farmers, who used to cultivate land near the coast, are obliged to go some ten miles further inland to grow Indian corn and yams. The season, however, while unfriendly to everything else near the coast (except the wild bush), is extremely friendly to the grape. Mr. Freeman, who has undertaken their culture at Beulah Gardens, has very heavy crops. He has been obliged, it is true, to water the vines, but the crop of grapes is large. Much praise is due to Mr. Freeman for thus introducing the cultivation of the grape, in addition to his plantation of cotton, and of coffee trees. His cotton crop, which he is now gathering, does not this year equal his expectations, owing to those peculiarities of the season already mentioned. Almost all the Europeans are away from this, having gone down to the neighbourhood of Adda with Colonel Conran, who has summoned a large native force, which is now assembling in the plains near the Volta, and consists mainly of Accras, Aquapems, and Kroboes. No reliable information has yet been given as to their probable course of action. You have already heard of the native troubles and excesses in those districts from Adda up to the Volta to Kpong, which latter was the great emporium for the Kroboe palm oil and the Krepee cotton, but which is reported as no longer existing, having been burned down by the Awoonahs and Aquamboes. The loss has been great. One merchant who had an establishment there, and machinery for crushing the palm nut and extracting the rich oil of the kernel, reports himself a ruined man. I fear the Governor will have much trouble in restoring order. The existing deplorable troubles are, of course, the natural and inevitable results of the provocative policy of the Government during the last six years, relative to the outlying tribes of the Protectorate. Many such difficulties as that now pending will probably (not possibly) arise, with heavy demands on the Cape Coast Treasury, or, those not being forthcoming, with general disgust and disaffection, and possibly an ultimate abandonment of the forts.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'No change to report in the state of the country. Trade is, if possible, still worse than before. Nearly all the merchants are out of cowries, and unable to obtain palm-oil, which is in greater abundance this year than for two years past. The scarcity of cowries arises chiefly from the entire stoppage of the Crepee and trans-Volta trade. One London house, which has been for some time past endeavouring to drive all other traders off the coast, had not a single cowry in its establishment last week. Unless the Crepee roads are speedily opened, the merchants and traders in Accra will be compelled to shut up shop. Matters cannot remain as they are. Neither the Local Government nor that of the Accras are doing anything to improve them. It is true that the Acting Administrator has given out to the kings a considerable sum from the Accra chest, for the ostensible purpose of enabling them to despatch a sufficient force to Crepee to assist Domprey, the Akim chief, in driving out the Ashantees and Aquamboes, and restoring order in the district; but the manner in which Mr. Simpson has gone about the affair has so disgusted the subordinate chiefs and the commons, both with himself and the kings, that not a single man will move, and the kings being powerless, nothing can be nor will be done; my previous letter will have shown you ""why."" Mr. Simpson\'s presumptuous contempt for the advice and opinion of the European merchants (to say nothing of natives) whose best interests are so largely involved, merits the severest censure; and his undisguised rudeness to them has deservedly deprived him of that respect which is generally accorded to the representative of the Queen. The last news from Crepee is that the Ashantees and Aquamboes are waiting for the junction of the Ahwoonahs before assuming the offensive.

I am now desired by the President to draw your attention to the condition of trade with the Gold Coast, whence several communications have been addressed complaining of the apathy and inactivity of the Colonial Government.\n\nIn January a memorial was received from Cape Coast, the purport of which was that the Gold Coast Government is responsible for the decline in trade, in consequence of no steps being taken to maintain authority on our borders, and to keep a highway for trade into the interior; and owing to the depredations of the tribes on the frontier, it is feared that British influence is declining, and trade is passing to other countries. With respect to the information that proper authority is not maintained within our borders, it is asserted that the Adansi tribe, who were driven out of Ashanti and have taken refuge in British territory, have been robbing native traders on their way from the interior to the coast, and that no adequate measures had been taken to suppress such outrages. In further support of the complaint that the trade paths outside our borders have been stopped, a copy of a memorial to the Governor of the Gold Coast has been received by the Chamber. It relates to trade which had been stopped by the Saipohies, through whose territory the Gamon and other interior traders have to pass to reach the British settlement on the coast. The Chamber is informed that H.M.\'s Government has received a copy of this memorial, and that their attention is being given to these representations; but I would respectfully remark that though the Government destroyed the power of Ashanti in 1874, they have not taken adequate steps to maintain that peaceful trade which passed through these tribes to the British settlement, though appeals have been made by the chiefs to the Government to put their country in order. The attention of the Chamber has been called to the despatches in the Blue-book of Sept., 1886, from which it appears that there has been great apathy on the part of the Gold Coast Government. That territory is about 300 miles in length, and because the trade of one part had increased in 1884, and the imports of spirits, tobacco, &c., had brought in £19,000 more customs duties, the Governor seemed to think that ""the general prosperity of the colony does not appear to have been affected by the decline of the trade of Cape Coast.""', 'last_edit_date': '1887-02-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST NEWS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Trade dull in the oil rivers, and no prospects of improvement, complications having taken place among native tribes arising out of a dispute between King Amachree, at New Calabar, and one of his chiefs named Will Braid, which progressed to such a point that on the 12th July the latter, after assembling all his people and collecting his goods, withdrew from the town altogether, and proceeded up the country. Here he took possession of the oil markets, and blockaded the creeks, and by these means put a stop to all traffic. Negotiations were in progress for the settlement of the dispute, but it was feared the outbreak would prove a serious matter; and in the event of hostilities taking place, it was anticipated that they would become general, for in Opobo and Bonny both sides would find sympathisers who would render active assistance. In this case the feud would assume much greater dimensions than the long and tedious warfare which followed Ja-Ja\'s secession from Bonny under somewhat similar circumstances several years ago.\n\nThe surf on the Gold Coast was very heavy, and communication was impossible in many places.\n\n(By Benguela, August 29.)\n\nActing-Governor Maloney left Lagos on the 24th July in the colonial steamer Gertrude, and proceeded up the river for the purpose of investigating a charge which had been brought against one of the chiefs of capturing and selling the natives for slaves. At Little Popo communication with the shore was interrupted in consequence of a panic amongst the canoe men. Five of their number had been seized and devoured by sharks in one day, and all the rest became terror-stricken, and could not be induced to continue at work.

It may be of interest to your readers as showing what things are frequently occurring in a British colony which extends nowhere more than 80 miles back from the sea, and which has a Governor with £3,500 a year, a secretary, and four assistant secretaries, to govern less than half a million people, living in a country of only 12,000 square miles:—\n\n""The Accrofuls and Puttooboos, who have always been creating disturbances in their district, had recently a quarrel, which terminated in a fight. On Monday morning, the 9th instant, the Puttooboos caught a native of Accroful, and this man, it is reported, they cruelly treated. They first took him and put him to death. This done, they surrounded the body with knives and cut it into small pieces, scattering the latter subsequently in various parts of their town, and taking the blood of the poor man and sprinkling it over their fetish. The Puttooboos, bent still on mischief, it is reported, then prepared their arms, and marched towards Accroful. Evidently the action of the Puttooboos was the outcome of certain ill-will which they bore towards the Accrofuls, and which, it is believed, was partially occasioned by the action of either the one or the other with respect to flags. Company fights are generally brought about by demonstrations with flags, and it is, perhaps, superfluous to add that those between villages or towns may often trace their origin to the very same source. The Accrofuls, it is stated, were suddenly surprised by the arrival in their village of an armed band of Puttooboos, who, on nearing the village, and seeing people, fired on them. From this account, it would appear that the Puttooboos were in Accroful before the Accrofuls could know that one of their natives had been killed and cut to pieces. The work of arming for a contest did not, however, occupy many minutes, and before the Puttooboos could believe it, their opponents were ready for them. Each party must then have retired to a spot close by, and there butchered one another. The fight commenced at 6 a.m., and lasted till 2 p.m., several being killed and wounded. Meanwhile news of the disturbance reached Cape Coast, and Captain Stewart, the District Commissioner, left with a party of armed police for the scene of hostilities. But the fighting was over. The combatants had scattered. Some Houssas, too, arrived on the scene from Elmina. The District Commissioner only succeeded in bringing to Cape Coast four natives of Puttooboo as prisoners.

This was due principally to the great fall in the price of palm oil, which is the staple export of the colony. The price has fallen from £40 a ton, at which it stood a few years ago, to £18 per ton. This result is mainly due to the competition of mineral oils. The assumption in the question that the colony is at present maladministered is unfounded.

1392,"Colonial economic policies in Africa during the colonial period were marked by tensions between private enterprise and government intervention, as well as resistance from both local and British traders against economic exploitation and selective consular protection.","The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced understanding of colonial economic policies in Africa, marked by tensions between private enterprise and government intervention, as well as resistance from both local and British traders. The textbook details how African producers, such as cocoa farmers in the Gold Coast, resisted economic exploitation by expatriate firms and the colonial government through hold-ups and boycotts, highlighting tensions between local interests and colonial economic policies. It also illustrates the interplay between private enterprise and government control, noting the role of private capital in policing and coercion, initially unchecked but later requiring state intervention. Furthermore, the textbook discusses resistance from African traders and workers, including strikes and boycotts, aligning with the claim of local resistance. However, it does not mention resistance from British traders or selective consular protection. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize complaints from British traders about excessive taxation and lack of protection from Her Majesty's Government, which they argue undermines their commercial interests. The articles also describe local traders' resistance, such as protests against new tariffs in the Gold Coast and refusals to pay increased duties. Additionally, they mention selective consular protection, with traders in the Opobo River seeking protection from Her Majesty's Consul, while others, like those in the Gambia, complain about the lack of government protection against local authorities. These examples illustrate the friction between economic exploitation and the interests of both local and British traders, supporting the claim.

Together, these sources underscore the complex dynamics of resistance and tension within colonial economic policies in Africa.","The ""General History of Africa"" textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding tensions between private enterprise and government intervention during the colonial period. It describes how African producers, such as cocoa farmers in the Gold Coast, resisted economic exploitation by expatriate firms and the colonial government through hold-ups and boycotts, highlighting tensions between local interests and colonial economic policies. The text also notes the role of private capital in policing and coercion, initially unchecked but later requiring state intervention, illustrating the interplay between private enterprise and government control. Furthermore, the textbook discusses the resistance from African traders and workers against economic exploitation, including strikes and boycotts, which aligns with the claim of resistance from local traders. However, the text does not explicitly mention resistance from British traders or selective consular protection, which is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, the textbook supports the notion of tensions and resistance within colonial economic policies but lacks specific references to British traders' resistance and consular protection.","The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim regarding colonial economic policies in Africa.

The articles also describe resistance from local traders, such as the protest against the new tariff in the Gold Coast and the refusal of Accra merchants to pay increased duties, which they deemed unjust. Additionally, the articles mention selective consular protection, with traders in the Opobo River seeking protection from Her Majesty's Consul, while others, like those in the Gambia, complain about the lack of government protection against local authorities. These examples illustrate the friction between economic exploitation and the interests of both local and British traders, supporting the claim.

Arrests were made and fines imposed by chiefs to maintain the hold-up. The effectiveness of the movement threatened the very foundation of colonial economic relations, as the colonial govern› ment, like the expatriate firms, depended on the cocoa trade for its revenue.

This time, the hold-up was extended to Western Nigeria, and it ended only with the intervention of the British government.

At first glance, these companies appeared to be unchecked in the process of accumulation. However, they bore the cost of the armed interventions necessary for destroying African political independence and for laying the groundwork of the colonial economies. They were indeed unrestrained in their brutality, especially where labour recruitment was made more difficult by sparse population, as in French Congo (now Congo). But chartered companies could not cope with coercive state functions. European states had to assume direct responsibility for their colonial territories - usually during the 1890s - and the locally established colonial state apparatus supervised the economy on behalf of private capitalists/The latter were usually compensated for relinquishing their political privileges, making it clear whose class interests were being advanced by the colonial regimes. Compensation was a means of financing these companies to place their enterprise on a more secure footing than had been the case when they were virtually in a state of war with the African people.\nMetropolitan states and their colonial counterparts in Africa had to con› tinue state coercion for economic exploitation, because the colonial economy had constantly to be hewn out in the face of opposition from Africans. In many places, African land had first to be seized before the settler-type socio-economic formations could flourish. The necessary infra› structure of roads and railways could be laid down only by government assistance, one aspect of which was the requisitioning of African labour. The use of taxation to build the money economy is a device which is too well known to require lengthy elaboration. Taxation undoubtedly provided the major constraint driving Africans initially into wage labour or cashcrop production; and subsequent increases in taxation deepened African involvement.

Towards this end they removed a substantial number of unco› operative 'traditional' rulers, thereby violating the religious and cultural sanctity of kingship. To reinforce their tenuous rule, they dispatched African police, drawn from the ranks of mercenaries and allies, to oversee the activities of 'colonial chiefs' and to intimidate the local population.

In the Congo, Africans were compelled to collect rubber and to work on the railways and in the mines, while in Mozambique a variety of multi-national concessionary companies were the principal beneficiaries of the forced labour. Other Mozambicans were exported to Southern Rhodesia, South Africa and Sao TomØ. In Sao TomØ, on the cocoa plantations, they were joined by thousands of Angolans. Although the details differed, this pattern of coercion and intimidation was repeated in recruiting Africans to work on the European plantations of Nyasaland and subsequently in the mines of Northern Rhodesia. 32 The peasants who remained at home were not exempted from conscrip› tion. Many members of the rural population were required by law to provide several weeks of free labour on public works projects or face immediate imprisonment.

African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported. However, in East Africa the 'Asian' merchants were essential for keeping the money economy intact and avoiding reversion to barter, just as their capital had been the original basis for the extension of specie and small-scale money exchanges throughout the region.$^{16}$ In the final analysis, therefore, the British administration co-operated to protect the interests of these retailers and produce buyers.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

Yet in 1879 this whole structure began to crumble, and by 1900 it had ceased to exist.' With the imposition of colonial rule, 'the characteristic link between Africans and Europeans was no longer that between trading partners ... The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance.

Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""Finally, whatever economic growth was achieved during the colonial period was done at a phenomenal and unjustifiable cost to the African - what with forced labour, migrant labour (which, says Davidson, 'probably did more to dismantle pre-colonial cultures and economies than most other aspects of the colonial experience put together'),$^{30}$ compulsory cultivation of certain crops, compulsory seizure of land, forced movements of popu› lations with the consequential dislocation of family life, the pass system, the high mortality rate in the mines and on the plantations, the brutality with which African resistance and protest movements generated by these measures were suppressed, etc. Above all, the monetary policies pursued by the colonial powers towards their colonies - tying their currencies to those of the colonial powers, introducing tariffs and keeping all foreign exchange earnings in the metropolitan capitals - while ensuring stable and fully convertible currencies, led to the freezing of colonial assets in the metropolitan capitals instead of their being realized and invested in the colonies.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation', 'content': ""There were exceptions to this situation of tension between the powerful traders and the general populace. Thus in the Bailundu kingdom in Angola 'everyone was engaged in commerce'; during the 1870s 'Umbundu entre› preneurs discovered and developed a new type of root rubber' and 'during the next decade an unprecedented number of Bailundu moved into private trade'. This widespread commercial prosperity came to an end with the drop of rubber prices in 1899-1902. 'The problem was intensified after 1899 in Bailundu by the intrusion of European traders ... When rubber prices plummetted, both Portuguese merchants and a new wave of poor whites ... arrived to establish themselves in commerce.' In the opinion of the most recent study of the Bailundu war of 1902, resentment at this European trade aggression had a great deal to do with the massive popular uprising which broke out against the Portuguese. 44 But in general historians of resistance who work from the economic per› spective associate mass revolt not with resentment at the European attack on trade, but with the more slowly developing realization on the part of African populations that the whites were determined to obtain cheap labour. Many Africans might at first welcome the Europeans as protectors against over-demanding chiefs, or rapacious Swahili traders, or slave-masters. But they very soon discovered that European demands upon them were equally, if not more, intolerable. At first many African slave-owners, chiefs and traders might respond to the Europeans with fear and hatred, but many of them found that in the longer run the interest of black and white holders of power often coincided.

There was another aspect to this phenomenon - the scramble for African re› sources. Diamonds and gold were among these, but perhaps the most valuable resource, and that for which the colonial authorities scram› bled passionately, was African labour. Just as the old European and Arab traders had bought slaves elsewhere in Africa, so the new labourrecruiting agencies scrambled for unskilled labour to work in the mining fields ... In Angola and Zambezi and Katanga (by the turn of the century) recruiting agents from the mines of the south were competing with agents from the Portuguese forced labour plantations in the Bight of Benin. 45 Just as the first Scramble for territory and sovereignty was resisted so was this second Scramble for labour. It was resisted in arms, and much of the support given to the great revolts of the early twentieth century which tried to redefine sovereignty came from men who hated forced labour. It was also resisted by desertion and strikes, by refusal to work underground, by compound riots.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Certainly, until the early 1930s, the tendency was to encourage whoever was likely to contribute in this respect.

The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

Areas which had been recently brought into the money economy or which were only lightly touched were the first to retreat. The same phenomenon had previously occurred at the end of the First World War, leaving colonial governments with the task of re-establishing the colonial economy in some regions. Many Tanganyikan peasants, who had a much lower level of involvement in money exchanges than their brothers on the Gold Coast, simply sought to abandon cash-crop farming in the years after 1930. In this they were not very successful, because the power of the colonial state was brought in to tilt the scales against what was considered to be a reversion to barbarism. Campaigns to 'grow more crops' were instituted, and bureaucratic sanctions were thinly veiled forms of force for the expansion of acreages in the face of falling prices.

This unequal exchange was reflected in the disparity between the low remuneration Africans received and the relatively high cost of manu› factured imports; and it also manifested itself in the low wage rate in the colonies as compared with the metropolises. Of course, unequal exchange was not a purely economic phenomenon. It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent. Growth in the export sector was possible only because it could constantly ii. S.

The bulk of the production within the growing money economy was never intended to meet local demand and consumption. Conversely, the variety of goods obtainable at the retail markets were increasingly of foreign origin. Local artisanship suffered heavily from European competi› tion and manipulation, along lines already manifest in the pre-colonial period. As the colonial economy became firmly rooted in the 1920s, Africans were producing that which they did not consume and consuming that which they did not produce. In effect, domestic demand did not stimulate the maximization of domestic resources. As a further deleterious consequence, the colonizers wasted some African resources and ignored others, because their yardstick was the utility of the given resource to Europe rather than Africa. None of the major economic elements such as savings, investment, prices, incomes and output were correlated in response to domestic require› ments. For these structural reasons, recent research by African economists and historians has challenged the old formulations of colonial development and has posited instead that colonialism produced economic dependence, lopsidedness and underdevelopment. 14 The most significant event in the evolution of African economies in the inter-war period was the great depression of 1929-33. When this hit the interdependent capitalist economies, it necessarily struck at the dependent African colonial economies - boldly illumining their extent and character in the process.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'As an eminent economist has pointed out, \'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically. Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

Yet it has proved extremely difficult in practice to discuss resistance within this chronological limitation. At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'. The European-controlled Atlantic trade, on the other hand, 'did not give rise to any productive forces: on the contrary, this caused a disintegration of society ... African societies obviously opposed this worsening of their situation, and Islam served as the basis for their resistance ... The Muslim priests tried to organize a resistance movement; their aim was to stop the slave trade, i.e. the export of the labour force, but not to end internal slavery ...

You will, ere this reaches you, have been some three weeks in possession of the Accra Petition which the kings and chiefs forwarded to you with a request that you would cause the same to be laid, with other papers, before the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies. You will not have forgotten what I wrote you, when forwarding those documents, to the effect that it was the general belief, founded upon lengthened ""experience"" (**real and not Brummagem**) that the local authorities at Cape Coast would be in no hurry to transmit the three copies of the petition sent to them to their destination in Downing-street. **Those three copies are still in the hands of the Administrator**, and I have little doubt but that they will remain in his hands until the arrival of his successor; therefore it is incumbent upon you to be active with that copy forwarded to you. This petition appears to have aroused the ire of the originators of the new scheme for ""raising the wind,"" and in order to testify their displeasure at the audacity of the white ""palm oil ruffians,"" and ""black niggers,"" and other ""slinking traders"" of Accra, in sending such a protest against their money schemes and their modes of administering the finances of the eastern district, they have recently sent a ""circular"" notifying to the merchants, traders, &c., of Accra that it is the opinion of the ""law officer of the Crown"" for these settlements, that the new tariff came into force throughout the settlements on the Gold Coast, from the date of the passing of Ordinance—**viz.**, from the 17th April and that therefore the Accra merchants would be liable to pay the duty of 2s. 6d. per gallon upon the 500 (or thereabouts) puncheons of rum which they have imported between the date of the passing of the Ordinance (17th April) and the day on which it was promulgated in Accra—**viz.**, the 23rd April. Now, as the difference between paying the duty at the rate of 1s. per gallon and 2s. 6d. per gallon, would simply amount, in the majority of the cases, to depriving our principal native merchants of the whole of their worldly goods, the fruits of the labour of a lifetime, and in some instances **a little more than the whole**, they, as well as all the European merchants, are resolved **not** to pay, come what will. The Administrator, acting, no doubt, under the advice of his legal ""Achates,"" is, I learn, equally resolved that they **shall** pay. All I can say, then, is that, unless Colonel Harley is prepared to take upon himself the responsibility of enforcing payment of such an unjust demand with shells and with rockets, and at the point of the bayonet—in fact, to do with the poor devils unfortunate enough (as the **Standard** observes) to be under his protection, what he has not as yet ventured to do with their invaders—he will have to gorge himself with more than enough of that which is vulgarly called ""humble pie."" The Accra merchants, black and white, may safely and with the utmost coolness fold their arms and say, ""We defy you and your **legal** (?) adviser, knowing, as we do, that we have right, justice, and the law on our side."" When this Ordinance was being circulated throughout Accra, it was accompanied by a notification to the effect that it came into operation only on that day, the 23rd April, 1873. How, after this, any lawyer—otherwise than one of those whom Lord Kimberley informed the deputation of African merchants he was obliged to send to the West Coast much against his will, and for want of better—could advise the Crown to insist upon the merchants paying duties at the new rate on rum and other articles imported or entered prior to the 23rd April, is what no nigger can comprehend; and I am convinced that **not even the Colonial Office** will support or connive at such a mode of dealing. And, pray, who is this law adviser, but the very judge who, in his capacity of chief magistrate, will have to sit in judgment and decide upon the issue of this very case upon which he has already given a verdict favourable to his employers, and which he would of course adhere to? Some of the merchants have already paid the shilling duty on their portion of the 500 puncheons of rum referred to, and hold receipts for the same. Nevertheless, it is rumoured that they will be called upon to stump up the additional 1s. 6d. per gallon duty.

They jumped at the offer of the National African Company, and were not too particular about the effect of entrusting the taxing and administrative powers to a party of traders who might be tempted to handicap competitors to secure to themselves a practical monopoly. It is true that the Charter purports to preserve the rights of other traders, but due and licence charges are doing the monopolists\' work on the Niger. What Liverpool merchants ask is that the Charter shall be revoked, and the administrative powers conferred on a non-trading organization. In the present company the dual position of governors and traders is anomalous, and leaves the management open to suspicion. The quotation from the Foreign Office letter suggests that Lord Salisbury has misconceived the desires of independent merchants and traders. They do not wish to return to the old system, but to secure such arrangements as will prevent the trade of the Niger being injured for the benefit of a chartered and limited company. They have established a case for that inquiry which should have preceded the grant of a charter. The incubus is the more galling from the circumstance that authority is conferred on a new company, to the detriment of merchants engaged in the trade of the rivers forming the Niger delta. Before the Government adopted so important a step as chartering one set of traders, they should have obtained the views of merchants who know something of the region in question. So far, the agents of the company do not appear to have achieved any administrative triumphs; their capacity seems to be limited to providing fellow-traders with grievances and driving out of the river the smaller class of traders. Such, at least, is the view of Liverpool merchants in the African trade, and their story should be investigated, and not officially pooh-poohed.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1887#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OFFICIAL TRADING AT THE GAMBIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.  \nBathurst, River Gambia, July 1st, 1881.\n\nSir,—It is about time that some attempt was made by the Colonial Office to put down trading on the part of certain officials here, some of whom, though receiving large salaries, carry on trade themselves, or through people hired for that purpose, thus competing with civilians who earn their living by trade.\n\nSome time ago an American vessel arrived here with an assorted cargo for sale; the Tide Surveyor boarded her in due course, and, as usual, no one could visit the vessel until the above official had concluded his inspection. The Tide Surveyor examined the manifest, and, among other items of cargo, saw a large quantity of shingles. These he knew were in great request in the town, as the rainy season was setting in, and the roofs of the houses of many people required repairing. He asked the supercargo, Captain Ryder, his price for the shingles, was told, and then purchased the lot, 55,000, thus being enabled to rule the market, as no one else had shingles in Bathurst. The vessel was duly entered, and the shingles landed by this Customs official, and he resold about 25,000 to the Engineer Department, and disposed of the balance, 30,000, in small lots, at a good profit, to various people in the town, who had to purchase them at any price, as the roofs of their houses leaked. Now, is it a fair thing that officials, whose salaries amount to hundreds per annum, should be free to compete with and injure the shopkeepers of Bathurst?\n\nIt has been a common thing for all kinds of provisions, clothing, also liquors, cigars, &c., to be purchased on board of the mail steamers by officials from the Custom House, brought on shore in the Customs' boat, taken up to the houses of the officials by the Customs' boat's crew, and what was not wanted for the use of the purchasing official, retailed to the people in the town, much under the price such articles could be sold at in the shops at a profit. Business here is very dull; the shops are just turning over the capital, and perhaps paying expenses, the shopkeepers making just a bare living. Is it right that such living should be further reduced by the private trade of officials?\n\nThe best remedy would be for the Colonial Office to send out instructions to the Administrator here to make all present and future officials subscribe to a declaration, setting forth that they are not, or will not be engaged in any trade, calling, or occupation, outside the sphere of their official duty, and that they do not, and will not, hire or engage anyone to carry on any such trade, calling or occupation on their sole or for joint behalf.\n\nWhat with officials of the Courts practising as attorneys, Customs and other officials trading, things here are in a far from satisfactory state.—I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,"", 'last_edit_date': '1881-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRADE WITH THE GAMBIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. J.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position.

They had to complain very much of the apathy manifested by the resident officials of Her Majesty's Government, who taxed the goods, but declined to afford any protection or assistance to British merchants. Those officials seemed to have an idea that they were sent out to rule and not to assist as much as possible in the development of British trade. Owing to the state of affairs which had been allowed to arise in the localities indicated, the trade in this country had suffered a very marked decline, for whereas in 1884 we sent 106,000,000 yards of cotton goods, representing a value of £1,320,000, we only sent last year 73,000,000 yards, or a money value of £851,000. He submitted that the Government ought to take prompt measures to protect the lives and property of British subjects in West Africa, and so assist in extending a very valuable market for English manufactures. They had just heard that last May, on the invitation of the German Government, Her Majesty's Government gave to Germany an assurance that a Congo International Conference should be pledged to the British Protectorate in the Niger, that only moderate duties should be levied, and that those should only be levied for the purpose of paying the expenses necessary to carry out the obligations of the Protectorate. At the same time it was understood that there should be no monopolies there, and those concessions were made without giving those who were really owners of property in the territories any voice in the country whatever. Two of the special objects of the merchants in obtaining these concessions from the natives and in obtaining the treaties of sovereignty and territory were that we should do the very utmost we could to stop the importation of spirits into the districts. That trade had increased very considerably during the last few years, and it was one of the curses which European countries were introducing into uncivilized countries, and would tend to retard the progress of our trade and the progress of civilization in the interior of Africa. He thought it was a discredit almost to the Powers of Europe that when great and earnest endeavours were made to limit the import of spirits into these places, there was an almost unanimous opinion expressed against it except by England.

From the poverty-stricken condition of the Free State Government, and for political reasons, I fear the duties will not be arranged in anything like a satisfactory manner for the traders, and if the French and Portuguese Governments follow suit, there is no saying where the thing will end; but of this we are certain, a great blow will be given to English enterprise, and we know that neither French nor Portuguese capitalists will put money in these colonies. Belgian capital is out of the question altogether; the Free State seems to be regarded as a hobby or a speculation of the King.

The reason is that the Dutch joint-stock company, De Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels Vennootschap, exports seven-eighths of the total produce of the Congo; its shares are in the hands of numerous holders; it is one of the oldest European establishments in that region, and has a character, an organisation, and a prospect higher than it ever previously possessed.\n\nThe duty which Holland is striving to fulfil with respect to her African Trading Company has its counterpart in England. We Englishmen have also compatriots whose history has been similar to that of the Dutch company. Though not possessing such an extensive interest, their establishments are spread over the territory claimed by the Portuguese and the French. These Powers may follow suit if the present encroachments be not resisted, and it behoves our Government to see that our merchants do not suffer through the proposed innovations. But Governments will not, cannot, act unless moved from outside, and the traders of the Congo district thoroughly realise this fact.

The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district. The ""customs"" have been abolished, a uniform export duty of 2s. 6d. per ton being levied instead. As things stand, we make no pretence to the sovereignty of the country; we only constitute ourselves the final authority in matters of dispute between the natives and traders of whatever nationality, and debar our continental neighbours from proclaiming themselves masters of the country. Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed.

The article in question says:—\n\nOne of the ways in which the development of trade must be carried out is by pushing factories up beyond the tribes who now serve as middlemen between the European trader and the native producer. Some difficulty will no doubt be encountered in passing through the unhealthy and malarious districts in which these middlemen live, but the improved knowledge we are obtaining of how to combat climatic diseases will render such an enterprise more easy than it would have been twenty years ago. Indeed, if we contrast the early reports of the Niger with its present exploitation, we may believe that the climate of no tropical country will permanently prevent its being opened up to commerce. This is a ray of hope for our African traders, and it is to be hoped that our Government will enable them to avail themselves of it speedily, and not allow them to be forestalled by the merchants of other nations. As if the inaction of our Government had not been sufficiently disastrous to the trade of the African merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, the home legislation of the last few years has also done much to hamper their enterprise. One industry alone, which, though it may be considered a small one, came in the aggregate to a considerable amount, has been completely driven out of the country. The trade in matches to the West Coast used to be supplied by Manchester. Now, the children who used to be employed in their manufacture are sent to school hungry, while German matches are sent in German ships to those who used to buy the English ones, and the only profit to English people is that of the middleman, and even that is being rapidly taken from them.\n\nThe German and French textile manufactures are also running us close, and we have to watch carefully the change of fashions and ideas among the natives. Many cheap articles made in France, with a ready sale on the coast, could easily be made in England. Some of the native manufactures could easily be imitated, such as the Niger cloths and the silk and cotton cloths made by the Santees and Ashantees of unravelled European stuffs. Beyond the Oil rivers to the south we have the French colony of the Gaboon, which has now become one of the largest tracts of Africa controlled by an European nation.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed.

The traders on this river are constantly exposed to great danger and loss owing to this want of Government protection. They are compelled by the chiefs and alcaldes to reside in their towns or stockades with their goods and produce. Formerly they built temporary stores and dwelling-houses at the river side or wharf of their several trading ports, by which they had little comparative risk from fire and native wars, the two chief accidents in this river. Of late that system has been done away with in some localities, through Government mismanagement, and the traders have sustained great losses; their goods and produce have in several places been consumed by fires, with the towns where they were compelled to reside, which would not have been the case had they been allowed to reside at the river side. This year the trade has been so dull, that cotton goods scarcely sold, and the very small portion of produce collected has been ultimately destroyed by fire; some thousand pounds worth at Sanding, some hundreds at Zambakotto, Juronku, Dassilammee, and Secker, and several other places—all by fire.

One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE EFFECT', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'THE EFFECT of the lately popular laissez-faire policy of the Government with regard to the British colonies and settlements in West Africa is beginning to make itself most unpleasantly realised.

From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia. The Governor has investigated the circumstances attending the hauling-down of the Union Jack at two stations in the interior. In one case it was found that the district was distinctly under British protection; the other was about ""forty yards outside the British limit.""

This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie.

Local industry stood up well to competition, and a balanced budget continued to be ensured thanks to esparto exports. 89 But the continual food shortage from 1881 to 1889 was the first sign of far-reaching change. Exports suffered. In addition, the market price of esparto collapsed, the volume of imported foodstuffs increased and from 1892 onwards the balance of trade showed a deficit. This deficit assumed huge proportions and became permanent after 1897. For, from that time onwards, the food requirements of the masses changed.

The slump and superabundant harvests, especially the 1935 one, led to the accumulation of enormous stocks of wine in Algerian and Tunisian cellars. Now the wine industry, particularly in Algeria, was one of the cornerstones of the settler economy. In Tunisia it provided a living for 1372 European proprietors: 'hence the bankruptcy of the wine industry could mean the bankruptcy of a large part of the French rural colony on whose settlement such care had been lavished'. 20 The crisis also affected the olive-oil industry, especially the Tunisian one, a third of whose annual output was exported, mainly to Italy but also to France. Now Italy subsidized its olive-oil producers, to encourage them to export at low prices and to protect its olive-oil industry; and in 1932 it imposed prohibitive duties on foreign oils. In 1935 it stopped its imports from France and the French empire in retaliation for the French embargo, adopted in pursuance of the League of Nations sanctions of 5 October 1935 following the Italian aggression against Ethiopia. The drop in exports and prices$^{21}$ admittedly hit Tunisian growers first; but it also hit the European planters in the Sfax area, who owned enormous estates and produced mainly for export.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio.

The increase of Arab power in Central Africa, and enormous growth of slave-hunting and the slave traffic in consequence, are notorious. The German traveller, Lieut. Wissmann, found extensive districts depopulated and burned by the Arabs in the Kassai and Sankaru regions. Then there has been the attack on the Stanley Falls Station. The wave of reviving Arab power which has been spreading westward from the Zanzibar coast is now, it appears, spreading southward also. The first impulse to this extension is said to date from the end of 1883, when for a time our policy of armed intervention on the coast was changed. Every Arab on the coast appears to have regarded this change as an indication that our opposition to the trade had been abandoned. The recent agreement between Germany and Portugal for the division of the country as far as Nyassa, and the limitation of the Sultan of Zanzibar's influence to a coast-zone ten miles wide, have probably also stimulated the Sultan to endeavour to extend his influence to the west beyond the regions claimed by Germany. Arab camps are being placed at commanding points on the slave-routes, and Arabs visit and settle in the villages of the more powerful of the native chiefs. In short, there appears to be evidence that the disturbances on the Tanganyika and Nyassa, and it may be at Stanley Falls, are not due merely to the turbulence of isolated Arab ivory and slave hunters, but are parts of something like a concerted movement. The suggestion certainly seems to throw a new light on the action or inaction of Tippoo Tib at Stanley Falls, and on the appearance of Arabs west of the Aruwimi on the Welle-Makua.""}, {'id': 5820, 'article_title': 'LETTERS FROM MR.

Since the destruction of Ijaye, of which we gave so full an account, furnished by one who had been in Ijaye during the entire siege, the work of devastation and pillage has been constantly going on. A missionary authority, writing of the thousands enslaved at Ijaye and Ishagga, adds: ""The small farming towns between Abeokuta and Ijaye are forsaken and destroyed; the fields have returned into wilderness; kidnappers and wild beasts infest the bush; and where corn, cotton, indigo, &c., were produced, there are now briars and thorns."" Awaye, a town of several thousand farming people, has been taken by the Ibadans, destroyed, and the inhabitants carried away as slaves. The rage of war, the hate of tribe against tribe, is increasing. Makun, a town of 8,000 people, was taken by the Abeokutans, after a siege of three months. The people were all made slaves. An eye-witness says: ""Thousands of them were carried to Abeokuta, many in a miserable state, necessitating their being carried in baskets by their captors. It was a heartrending scene to see these poor people carried along—husbands without their wives, mothers without their children, the latter without their parents; and most of them destined to spend the remainder of their lives in slavery.""\n\nThe Ibadans are now encamped at Ipara, a small Ijebu town, about a day\'s journey south of Ibadan; the Ijebus and Egbas have their camp in Makun, a short day\'s journey south of Ipara, and only one day\'s journey from the coast. It is said that the Ibadans have pressed the Dahomans to attack Abeokuta under these favourable circumstances.\n\nThe same authority says that there seems to be no hope at present of any pacification. Men\'s passions are inflamed; there are many who love war for the sake of plunder; the love of man-stealing, of catching slaves, is increasing. And yet, in consequence of the favourable position of Abeokuta as regards Lagos, of the successful efforts of missionaries during the last twenty years, and the constant demand made by merchants for produce, ""food in Abeokuta is abundant, the markets are well stocked, the farms well cultivated, a considerable quantity of cotton is going forward to Lagos for England, and more cotton seed has been sown than in any former year.""', 'last_edit_date': '1862-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British Operations in the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In *Payne\'s Lagos Almanack*, about ten years ago, attention was drawn to the injury which was being done to the more peaceful tribes of Yorubaland: ""Few people know the full extent of the sufferings endured by the population of the lower and western part of the Yoruba country, from year to year, and caused by the annual raids made by the Dahomeyans. From the boundary of their territory to the town of Abeokuta the distance is, as the crow flies, about 85 miles of land, which is inhabited by the Yoruba tribes of the Ketus and Egbados. Towards the south lies the territory of Porto Novo, Ado, Ota, Badagry; the whole extending north to south about 45 miles. This gives an area of about 3,000 square miles of land inhabited by industrious farm labourers; it is the region from which we draw our supply of animal and vegetable provisions, the country which to a large degree supplies the trade of Lagos; the Ijebu country in the east being as yet only open on its coast line. Now what is the result of the annual inroads of the Dahomeyans into this territory? Let it be understood that the inhabitants of these 3,000 square miles do not, for one-third of the year, feel themselves safe from attack, and that this third of the year is the most important part of the year to the farmers—the planting time. It has happened during the last few years that the poor farmers have been lingering about their farms preparing them for the planting of yams, Indian corn, and other things, when the enemy has fallen upon them and carried them away, so that the authorities of Abeokuta have now forbidden them to remain in their farm-villages during this season of danger. But what is the consequence of all this? People fear the breaking out of famine in Abeokuta—a large town inhabited by 100,000 farmers. What an anomaly in a country so thinly populated, and deprived, as it has been so largely, of its able-bodied labourers, by a century of the slave-trade, and yet so it is. This very year the Dahomeyan hordes hunted the country up and down, making towns and villages unsafe, kidnapping on a large scale—refugees from Ota came even here to Lagos—until they finally pounced upon two villages in the Ketu country, which they completely sacked, and returned loaded with plunder. Under such circumstances, how can trade flourish, when people are unable to obtain the necessaries of life, and when their town is threatened with famine? It is but little likely that he who is in anxiety about the needful harvest will take much trouble to gather in palm-nuts, which ripen during the same first four months of the year, or to gather in the cotton which at the same time whitens his fields. Both must rot or be destroyed by birds and insects. It is not easy to imagine how great the amount of produce would be that might be obtained from this extensive region if those yearly raids were put a stop to. One strange feature in the case is, that this happens so near to Lagos—only some twenty miles from the lagoon, which is navigable nearly the whole of the before-mentioned eighty-five miles of territory. The loss arising from these raids is not by any means confined to the people who are the first to suffer; but the trade of Lagos, whether as regards that done in the direction of Abeokuta, Badagry, or Porto Novo, suffers most seriously. It is to be hoped that England will not overlook this matter when the time for settlement with the King of Dahomey comes.

The statement of these men is somewhat alarming, and presents a new feature in the history of plunder and brutal treatment to persons which from time to time are reported to us as taking place on that river. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ABEOKUTA', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## ABEOKUTA.\n\n**TRADE REPORT.**—The past month has been a most unprofitable and unsatisfactory one to merchants.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ABEOKUTA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There is much disturbance in the Yoruba countries.

The great error committed by the merchants of this place in former years, and the effect of which is now severely felt, was that in directing their efforts to the cultivation and promotion of the ground-nut they gradually neglected those products which had been to them their sole source of wealth, and as the trade in the ground-nut increased in magnitude, so the others declined, until we are now only apprised of their former existence by referring to the old books of the late merchants. The trade in gold, ivory, hides, wax, &c., formerly so lucrative not only in respect to its intrinsic value, but also as to its being attended with little or no expense to the buyer, is now nearly extinct, and the rich caravans have found a better and brisker market among our French neighbours on the Senegal, whilst their brother traders in Sino and Saloum threaten to deprive us of our last source of wealth—viz., the ground-nut, if source of wealth it can be termed. The demand for the ground-nut in our market is yearly more limited, and in the French market the Gambia nut has lost its value owing to depreciation in weight and quality of late years.

The statement of these men is somewhat alarming, and presents a new feature in the history of plunder and brutal treatment to persons which from time to time are reported to us as taking place on that river. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-05-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Restoration of Israel', 'section_title': '', 'content': "".**\n\n*September 30 to October 7.*\n\n**India-rubber.**—42½ tons African thimbles, at 2s. to 2s. 2d.; Sierra Leone niggers, at 1s. 9½d.; Congo ball, at 1s. 9¾d.; and tongue, at 1s. 5d., with 138 slabs, Carthagena, at 1s. 4½d. per lb.\n\n**Camwood.**—11 tons, at 27l. 5s. per ton.\n\n**Benni Seed.**—120 bags, African, at 52s. 6d. per 384 lbs.\n\n**Palm Kernels** sell freely on arrival at prices in sellers' favour; 2,640 bags at 11l. to 13l. 2s. 6d. per ton.\n\n**Ground Nuts** 10s. to 15s. dearer; 30 tons African, in bags, sold at 13l. 17s. 6d. to 14l. per ton.\n\n**Adansonia Fibre.**—100 bales, at 11l. 5s. per ton.\n\n**Palm Oil.**—The sales will again reach 1,200 tons; a reaction of 10s. per ton at the close of last week has been almost entirely recovered, and the market closes firm at the quotations.

The General History of Africa provides instances of resistance, such as the 1919 riots and strikes in Sierra Leone, which, while partly directed against Levantine traders, fundamentally protested the colonial economy's management. In the Gold Coast, cocoa farmers organized hold-ups and boycotts against expatriate firms to demand higher prices, and unions formed in The Gambia in response to rising prices, indicating organized resistance. However, the textbook does not emphasize the use of petitions or the specific role of tariffs, focusing instead on direct actions like strikes and boycotts with significant local economic and social impacts. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing widespread petitions and protests against British-imposed ordinances and tariffs. They describe actions such as the Cape Coast Protectorate's petition against taxation without consultation and Sierra Leone merchants' opposition to an ordinance requiring security for costs in legal actions. The articles also mention the collection of subscriptions to send commissioners to England and the signing of petitions by hundreds of local merchants, demonstrating organized resistance. While the articles highlight the involvement of both native and European merchants and address issues beyond trade and tariffs, such as the abolition of trial by jury, they underscore the broader discontent with colonial policies, aligning with the claim of significant local economic and social impact.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several instances of resistance by local merchants and traders against colonial economic policies, though not always in the form of widespread petitions and protests as the claim suggests.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices.

The dominant European popula› tion, as in the United States, perceived these forms of 'day-to-day resistance' as prima facie evidence of the docility and ignorance of their subordinates rather than as expressions of discontent. 34 Tax evasion occurred with great frequency throughout all of Central Africa. Just before the arrival of the tax collector, all or part of a village would flee into an inaccessible region until the state official departed. In Northern Rhodesia, the Gwemba Tonga were notoriously successful evaders, as were their Bisa and Unga neighbours who fled into the Bagwelu swamps.$^{35}$ This practice was so common in Mozambique that one official noted in disgust, 'It remains unknown how many times six or more adults will flee from their kraal leaving only a blind, ill or elderly individual who is exempt from taxes'.$^{36}$ Those Africans fortunate enough to live along international borders could slide back and forth across the frontier avoiding the tax collectors of both colonies. The Yaka periodically fled across the Kwango River which separated Angola and the Congo, while their compatriots took advantage of the unpatrolled frontier to cross into the French Congo where they remained until harassed by local tax officials. 37 A similar strategy was employed by disenchanted members of the rural populations living in the Milanje region along the Nyasaland-Mozambique border and in the Gaerezi Valley separating Rhodesia and Mozambique."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation', 'content': ""There were exceptions to this situation of tension between the powerful traders and the general populace.

Opposition to dipping took a variety of forms. In Pondoland the peasants initially refused to pay the tax.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

The tendency of West African merchant firms to monopolize through 'pools' is well known, and trading companies throughout the continent guarded their interests by refusing to compete in such a way as to raise prices. Indeed, intermediaries such as the 'Asians' in East Africa and the Lebanese in West Africa also set prices and conditions among themselves so that the African peasant had little choice when he went to make his sales. The cash-crop farmer faced the prospect of being gypped at the weighing scales, in the processing stage (as with the cotton ginnery), in transportation, in the calculation of returns and in the repayment of loans or advances where applicable. African producers were also making retail purchases from the middlemen traders and the commercial firms. A fundamental inequality marked the exchange between the colonial economy and the metropolises. This unequal exchange was reflected in the disparity between the low remuneration Africans received and the relatively high cost of manu› factured imports; and it also manifested itself in the low wage rate in the colonies as compared with the metropolises. Of course, unequal exchange was not a purely economic phenomenon. It derived from the asymmetry in political power and from the organizational and technological weaknesses of African producers. 11 Africans were exploited by the colonial system irrespective of whether or not they produced an export surplus. Tax collection grew more and more far-reaching, and it was utilized not so much for services to the people as for building the state and economic infrastructure. The migrant labour of the mines, farms and plantations was secured at the expense of the previously autonomous village and local economies. Thereby, capital avoided the cost of production of labour. As in slavery, labour arrived fully formed from outside the capitalist system as such. Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

When we first heard\n\nof the attempt, some months ago, we gave our opinion pretty freely, although moderately, on the subject, believing that Mr. Huggins would abandon a course for which no justification whatever could be found, and which, if adopted, would operate as a most grievous denial of justice to those classes of the community in Sierra Leone who have especial need of the protection now afforded under the operation of British law in the colony. We rejoice to see that a general public meeting, which seems to have been attended by all the influential native merchants and traders, was held on the 21st of July, for the purpose of publicly discussing this proposed Ordinance, which was unanimously condemned by the meeting. Mr. Lake said, with great force and justice, ""We are required to give security—that is the whole principle of the bill; any man aggrieved, ill-treated, beaten, kicked, is required to give security for costs before he can enter an action against the person who ill-treated him—that is the principle of the bill.""\n\nThe following Petition was unanimously approved and signed immediately by about 120 persons:—\n\n*To his Excellency Colonel J.

We look upon the Constitution Ordinance as the Cape Magna Charta. When this contract between the Imperial Government and the colony was entered into, the former assumed its proper functions as guardian of the weakest of its children—the natives. With wonderful foresight it firmly insisted that the natives should have a share in the self-government of the colony, and with this view the franchise was lowered so as to embrace the native.\n\n“We contend that it is this contract that has been violated by one of the contracting parties. All we are trying to ascertain is, does the other party to the contract—the Imperial Government, which is also our guardian—acquiesce in what has been done? If it does, and as a consequence natives are excluded from British citizenship, then the confidence of our people in British justice will be rudely shaken, and the vaunted government of the people by the people shunned by the natives as a delusion and a snare.”\n\nThe *Cape Times* says: “As far as the Registration Act is concerned, the native delegates must await the course of events, but in the agitation against the destruction of their people by the removal of the restriction on the sale of brandy they have the sympathy of all good colonists on their side.

Some years ago, the white agents and the merchants in Bonny held a council to plan in what way to expel the black traders from the town of Bonny. They suggested to the King that he should drive away the black traders—that they were spies and tale-bearers, and, by admitting them into the town, they would give occasion for the English Government to take the country from the King. They thought that by these false statements the King would at once expel the black traders from the town; but the King, instead of this, summoned all the chiefs and principal men, and laid the matter before them. They found that the representations made to the King arose from envy, malice, and hatred; and the King said to the agents and merchants that he found no cause for expelling the black traders, adding, if there was any palaver between them and the white men, and the black men from Sierra Leone, they could go to their consul and settle it. Since then all opposition and oppression by the white agents or merchants has been checked, and the black traders are privileged to do business at Bonny Town. The same thing is now occurring at Opobo River. The same firms that are doing business in Bonny River are doing business at Opobo. They have held a council again, planning in what way they may get the black traders from the town of Opobo. You ask, what is the cause of this opposition? Do the black traders get more oil than the agents? Nay, how many casks of oil do you think black traders have shipped in a year? About 50 and sometimes 60 casks. How many casks do the white agents ship in a year? About 900 to 1,000 each house. From what motive, then, is this opposition? Not from envy. There must be some secret going on between the agents that they should call black traders spies and tale-bearers. What do they mean by that? Are they doing something contrary to the English Government, or something against their employers at home? Let the wise men take it in consideration—they will see for themselves; when the water settles they will see what is at the bottom. The black traders do not go to the Coast to be inspectors—they go to trade; but when the white men see any black trader or British subject, they cannot contain themselves, as when a captain of a Portuguese slave-ship happened to see an English man-of-war coming. What is the cause of this? Is it a deep secret known only between the agents? They have forwarded their false representations to the King, instigating him to drive out the black traders, for no tangible reason. The charge alleged to the black traders is that they object to the black traders doing business at the town of Opobo; they must go down to the beach and build houses there to do business, and if they cannot do that, the King must turn them out.

From the poverty-stricken condition of the Free State Government, and for political reasons, I fear the duties will not be arranged in anything like a satisfactory manner for the traders, and if the French and Portuguese Governments follow suit, there is no saying where the thing will end; but of this we are certain, a great blow will be given to English enterprise, and we know that neither French nor Portuguese capitalists will put money in these colonies. Belgian capital is out of the question altogether; the Free State seems to be regarded as a hobby or a speculation of the King.

The reason is that the Dutch joint-stock company, De Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels Vennootschap, exports seven-eighths of the total produce of the Congo; its shares are in the hands of numerous holders; it is one of the oldest European establishments in that region, and has a character, an organisation, and a prospect higher than it ever previously possessed.\n\nThe duty which Holland is striving to fulfil with respect to her African Trading Company has its counterpart in England. We Englishmen have also compatriots whose history has been similar to that of the Dutch company. Though not possessing such an extensive interest, their establishments are spread over the territory claimed by the Portuguese and the French. These Powers may follow suit if the present encroachments be not resisted, and it behoves our Government to see that our merchants do not suffer through the proposed innovations. But Governments will not, cannot, act unless moved from outside, and the traders of the Congo district thoroughly realise this fact.

The Tide Surveyor examined the manifest, and, among other items of cargo, saw a large quantity of shingles. These he knew were in great request in the town, as the rainy season was setting in, and the roofs of the houses of many people required repairing. He asked the supercargo, Captain Ryder, his price for the shingles, was told, and then purchased the lot, 55,000, thus being enabled to rule the market, as no one else had shingles in Bathurst. The vessel was duly entered, and the shingles landed by this Customs official, and he resold about 25,000 to the Engineer Department, and disposed of the balance, 30,000, in small lots, at a good profit, to various people in the town, who had to purchase them at any price, as the roofs of their houses leaked. Now, is it a fair thing that officials, whose salaries amount to hundreds per annum, should be free to compete with and injure the shopkeepers of Bathurst?\n\nIt has been a common thing for all kinds of provisions, clothing, also liquors, cigars, &c., to be purchased on board of the mail steamers by officials from the Custom House, brought on shore in the Customs' boat, taken up to the houses of the officials by the Customs' boat's crew, and what was not wanted for the use of the purchasing official, retailed to the people in the town, much under the price such articles could be sold at in the shops at a profit. Business here is very dull; the shops are just turning over the capital, and perhaps paying expenses, the shopkeepers making just a bare living. Is it right that such living should be further reduced by the private trade of officials?\n\nThe best remedy would be for the Colonial Office to send out instructions to the Administrator here to make all present and future officials subscribe to a declaration, setting forth that they are not, or will not be engaged in any trade, calling, or occupation, outside the sphere of their official duty, and that they do not, and will not, hire or engage anyone to carry on any such trade, calling or occupation on their sole or for joint behalf.\n\nWhat with officials of the Courts practising as attorneys, Customs and other officials trading, things here are in a far from satisfactory state.—I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,"", 'last_edit_date': '1881-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN ""MIDDLEMAN"" AND OTHER HINDRANCES TO TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the course of some excellent articles which have appeared lately in the *Manchester Guardian*, dealing with the present and future trade prospects of Africa, we have one chapter devoted to the consideration of the drawbacks upon genuine commerce by the enforcement of such quasi-regal rights as those exercised by Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, and the rest of that host of petty kinglings, in the districts of the West Coast. The article in question says:—\n\nOne of the ways in which the development of trade must be carried out is by pushing factories up beyond the tribes who now serve as middlemen between the European trader and the native producer. Some difficulty will no doubt be encountered in passing through the unhealthy and malarious districts in which these middlemen live, but the improved knowledge we are obtaining of how to combat climatic diseases will render such an enterprise more easy than it would have been twenty years ago. Indeed, if we contrast the early reports of the Niger with its present exploitation, we may believe that the climate of no tropical country will permanently prevent its being opened up to commerce. This is a ray of hope for our African traders, and it is to be hoped that our Government will enable them to avail themselves of it speedily, and not allow them to be forestalled by the merchants of other nations. As if the inaction of our Government had not been sufficiently disastrous to the trade of the African merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, the home legislation of the last few years has also done much to hamper their enterprise. One industry alone, which, though it may be considered a small one, came in the aggregate to a considerable amount, has been completely driven out of the country. The trade in matches to the West Coast used to be supplied by Manchester. Now, the children who used to be employed in their manufacture are sent to school hungry, while German matches are sent in German ships to those who used to buy the English ones, and the only profit to English people is that of the middleman, and even that is being rapidly taken from them.\n\nThe German and French textile manufactures are also running us close, and we have to watch carefully the change of fashions and ideas among the natives. Many cheap articles made in France, with a ready sale on the coast, could easily be made in England. Some of the native manufactures could easily be imitated, such as the Niger cloths and the silk and cotton cloths made by the Santees and Ashantees of unravelled European stuffs. Beyond the Oil rivers to the south we have the French colony of the Gaboon, which has now become one of the largest tracts of Africa controlled by an European nation.

The traders on this river are constantly exposed to great danger and loss owing to this want of Government protection. They are compelled by the chiefs and alcaldes to reside in their towns or stockades with their goods and produce. Formerly they built temporary stores and dwelling-houses at the river side or wharf of their several trading ports, by which they had little comparative risk from fire and native wars, the two chief accidents in this river. Of late that system has been done away with in some localities, through Government mismanagement, and the traders have sustained great losses; their goods and produce have in several places been consumed by fires, with the towns where they were compelled to reside, which would not have been the case had they been allowed to reside at the river side. This year the trade has been so dull, that cotton goods scarcely sold, and the very small portion of produce collected has been ultimately destroyed by fire; some thousand pounds worth at Sanding, some hundreds at Zambakotto, Juronku, Dassilammee, and Secker, and several other places—all by fire.

Their losses have been so heavy by these traders that they fear to trust men with goods to go up the river; and they say it is better to almost remain idle and wait for some favourable change, than to run the risk of further losses that may ruin them.\n\nThen, a large number of the working class of the native community are, consequent on the reduction in the trade, idle, and are living on one meal a day.\n\nA large number of the Liboo traders who were employed as traders in former years could not get engagements this year, so did not come down from Senegal, and being in danger of starvation, had to go and work as labourers on the railway the French are making from St. Louis to Dakhar. These are facts known to many here.\n\nAny man who says that the commercial houses here charge a trader 600l. for 200l. worth of goods at first cost, states not an ""indisputable fact,"" but the reverse. The average price of goods sold for cash in Bathurst is about 60 per cent. on European cost price; out of this have to be paid expenses of importation and landing into store, ship rent, expenses of sale, depreciation and waste, bad debts, interest on money. These goods, when delivered to a trader in the Lower River, are charged in his invoice at 50 per cent. on the Bathurst cash price; but in the past two years that got down to 25 per cent., and even less. In the Upper River the percentage is higher, but variable. The trader gets all his expenses at the port credited to him, such as ""customs"" to the chiefs, &c., which average 7l. to 10l. per trader per season; then the station expenses for presents to farmers, &c., porterage of produce, landlords\' rent, &c., which are about 15 to 20 per cent. on value of produce bought, are all allowed to a trader. Goods sent to him and produce taken from him are freight free. If he pays an extravagant price, or gives extravagant presents, or is extravagant in his expenses, that is his own fault, and he will make a loss. His produce is taken at 2s. the 15 x 15 measure; but if it is taken at 1s. 9d. the 28 lbs. the imperial bushel, then he has a profit of 40 to 50 per cent. on his produce—the difference between a 15 x 15 measure and an imperial bushel of good ground nuts. Credit to the natives is given by traders during the rains, as the natives have not produce always at that time to pay for what they want; but in the ground nut season, traders are distinctly bound by their agreements not to give credit; and if they do, and lose, they are to blame.\n\n""Dealers"" are men who get goods at lower rates, and get higher prices for their produce.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed.

In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos. Great numbers of clerks and artisans, anxious for engagements as heretofore at various parts of the coast, are unable to obtain employment, or only at reduced rates of wages.\n\nTo these communities 1888 will probably bring good tidings.

Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions.

There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity.

1489,"British colonial actions and policies in Africa, including military interventions and trade disruptions, led to significant economic instability and competition, adversely affecting both local economies and British commercial interests.","The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view of the economic instability and competition resulting from British colonial actions and policies in Africa. The textbook highlights the exploitation of African resources and labor, the imposition of monoculture economies, and the neglect of industrialization, all of which contributed to economic instability. It describes how African economies were integrated into the world capitalist system in a manner that primarily benefited the imperial power, leading to the disruption of inter-African trade and a reorientation towards metropolitan countries, further destabilizing local economies. The British colonial administration's preference for British firms and the imposition of tariffs on non-British goods created competition that disadvantaged local African traders. However, the textbook does not explicitly address the adverse effects on British commercial interests. In contrast, The African Times articles provide insights into how British colonial actions also negatively impacted British commercial interests.

The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The colonial presence also led, as has been pointed out above, to the appearance on the African scene of an increasing number of expatriate banking, shipping and trading firms and companies, and from the 1910s onwards their amalgamation and consolidation into fewer and fewer oligo› polies. Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

The appropriation of the surplus by international capital is revealed by the backwardness and general poverty of the dependencies during the mid-i930S.

In 1932 Imperial Preference was introduced in British dependencies. Imports from the British Empire had customs duties fixed at between 10 and 50% lower than the general level.

In September 1931 the Colonial Office dispatched a circular to officers administering depen› dencies asking them to help Britain and reminding them that: the interests of the United Kingdom and those of the Colonies and Dependencies are inseparably bound up with one another, that the perils which face the United Kingdom are perils which menace the whole Empire ... that any general collapse of British credit and declir - in the exchange value of sterling must spell ruin for the colonies no less than for the United Kingdom. 83 Despite the higher tariff on non-British goods, their importation, to the advantage of consumers in the dependencies, increased greatly.

The development was especially important during this period of economic distress.

In 1934 a further attack was made on non-British goods by raising the tariff to 100%, as a general rule. In addition, a quota system was imposed on the importation of Japanese textiles.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

There was an overall revival of coercion in economic relations, indicating that the colonial economy had to be buttressed by non-economic means when in crisis. African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported. However, in East Africa the 'Asian' merchants were essential for keeping the money economy intact and avoiding reversion to barter, just as their capital had been the original basis for the extension of specie and small-scale money exchanges throughout the region.$^{16}$ In the final analysis, therefore, the British administration co-operated to protect the interests of these retailers and produce buyers.

Germany's own colonies, even before they were occupied by the Allies, were cut off from trade with the mØtropole because of Allied dominion over the seas. Germany, from being tropical Africa's major overseas trading partner, was now almost entirely excluded from trading activities in the continent, for once the Allies completed their occupation of the German colonies, all German nationals were interned and their plantations, commercial houses and industries were taken over by the occupying powers.

Thus Egyptian cotton rose from £E$ a quintal in 1914 to £E8 in 1916-18. 51 But increased demand was not always reflected by increased prices, for often the colonial governments controlled the prices paid to the producers.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions"", 'content': 'The situation of the Africans, always precarious, became in 1930 as tragic as it had been at the beginning of the period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 536, 'article_title': 'MEMORIAL OF SIERRA LEONE RESIDENTS AT LAGOS TO COMMISSIONER ORD.', 'full_section_title': 'MEMORIAL OF SIERRA LEONE RESIDENTS AT LAGOS TO COMMISSIONER ORD.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1865#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_02_1865', 'content': 'Since the cession hundreds of slaves have made their escape to Lagos; many were sent by their masters to convey supplies from their creditors, but on reaching Lagos took shelter within the slave court, and in course of time they were either liberated, apprenticed, or a compensation, in most cases not half the value of a slave, were given them.

It seems that for some time past life and property up the Gaboon River have been placed in danger through the outrages of the natives. These outrages have been brought to the notice of the French authorities at Gaboon, but it seems they have shown great apathy in dealing with the subject; indeed, it is alleged that the Commandant has informed the traders that their property and they themselves would not be molested if they dealt fairly with the natives. In proof of this, the Commandant himself went up the river in a boat unarmed. He had not gone far, however, before he was fired at by the natives from the shore. Fortunately, he escaped unhurt, though one bullet passed through the sleeve of his coat. Subsequently, a French gunboat was sent up the river to inquire into the matter. On the approach of the vessel some natives came off to her with fruit, which they wished to sell. It is stated that the crew then attempted to arrest the natives, who numbered about forty. Becoming alarmed, most of the natives jumped over the ship's side into the water, and it is alleged that whilst striking out for the shore most of them were shot down by the crew of the gunboat. Two men who were arrested on the deck of the vessel were afterwards hanged from the yard-arm. The gunboat then returned to Gaboon, and the circumstance was reported. The Commandant, however, is stated to have disapproved of thus summarily dealing with the natives, and looked upon the matter as an outrage on French subjects. He has therefore, it is stated, placed the commander of the vessel under arrest. It is further stated that the French authorities had told the traders they must protect their own interests, but the prohibition of arms into Gaboon prevents them having the means of even their own defence. The British Consul of Loanda, Mr. Cohen, was at Gaboon when the despatch left, making inquiries into the alleged undue treatment of British merchants at Gaboon. From Sette Cama news was received that the French had annexed Ngove, and the English traders and natives of Sette Cama were afraid that the French would also take their town. Both Ngove and Sette Cama are independent places, and the trade is carried on exclusively by British merchants. Ngove is the next port further south from Gaboon, and Sette Cama adjoins Ngove still further south. All along Cape St. Catherine has been looked upon as the recognized boundary of the French possession of Gaboon. A petition, it is said, has been forwarded to Mr. Cohen by the inhabitants of Sette Cama, informing him of what has taken place, and expressing their anxiety for their own town. They have also asked the Consul to visit them, in order that the French may not take Sette Cama.""}, {'id': 4923, 'article_title': 'Proceedings before the King of Nassarawa', 'full_section_title': 'Proceedings before the King of Nassarawa', 'last_edit_date': '03-29-1884', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_10_1884', 'content': 'The King: ""It is quite evident that Mr. Dangerfield had some other aim in view than shooting.

The colony is dependent on customs dues for its revenue, and to pay the cost of administration, it is necessary that imports should be taxed. Foreign nations have trumped up claims to trading stations, to which a few years ago they attached no importance, and established ports close to our territories, even at times dividing one portion of the colony from another, whereby difficulties are thrown in the way of the British merchant, and his rival is enabled to land goods duty free, which, by a system of smuggling, compete with those which have to pay the dues of the British colony. The increased means of communication incident on the introduction of steam have largely increased the competition and enabled a fresh class of trader to enter into the business, so that profits have been cut down still more. The want of means of small native traders, and the laxity with which inexperienced merchants give credit, have led to many bad debts, which seriously affects trade. The English merchant without regular correspondents on the coast, and who supplies goods to those who write to ask for credit, should remember that many a man without any more capital than an envelope and a sheet of paper can write a business letter. A favourite ""dodge"" of these adventurers is to write for quantities of samples of all sorts and kinds, from a needle to a sewing-machine, from a biscuit to cases of wine or spirits, and thus gradually establish themselves as traders.

Formerly, the word of an Englishman would pass current here for a solemn oath, and when men were arguing it was common for one of the parties to close the discussion with ""What is the use of further talk? it is white man\'s language I use."" What is said now is, ""Our fathers used to tell us that white men never lied, but we find they lie more than the black men."" Just now, when friends are most needed, we have to deplore the loss of Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Chesson. Their efforts were never acknowledged, but possibly the country will wake up some day, and, however late, evince its gratitude, and do their memory justice. When a white man comes here he seems to entertain some sort of notion of doing us honour by coming among us; but what is it when we are placed under the foot of one whose ancestors only a generation or two back originated on these shores, whose every word and act is an insult, and whose one aim is to be taken for an unmixed white by showing especial hatred to every black? It is as ancient as the days of Solomon that a poor man oppressing the poor is like ""a sweeping rain."" The peasant of ""The League of the Shoes"" knew what it was to be oppressed by fellow peasants, and it was known in the West Indies that a slave-driver was the worst of tyrants. When it may please England to cease to govern us as slaves, and give us the government and institutions of free men, and cease to take the word of men invested with absolute power that everything is as it should be, and that absolutism is the only form of government for niggers, is for her consideration! It answers a purpose, no doubt, to represent us as disloyal and untrustworthy. It is many years since the Colonial Office was led to believe that we were in rebellion, and the lives of the officials so unsafe, that the constant presence of ships of war was needful for their protection; and the one good thing Sir Samuel Rowe did was to expose this fallacy and deception by dismissing the cruisers to their proper duty. When everything a man puts his hand to turns out disastrously, ""fate"" is not justly to be blamed. No man is perpetually unfortunate, and, himself blameless. At the present time almost all trade is at a deadlock—through good government, of course. The country is in a most unsettled, uneasy state, no one knowing what is to be the next piece of wisdom. Government in these days consists of holding councils, and every day passing some new law. When a British Governor robbed the people of their servants without compensation, it was understood there was to be an end of all slavery, and several people have been fined for buying slaves. How is it that the Government buys slaves under the name of recruits? This is being openly spoken of and the price paid is mentioned. It was in one of these expeditions to procure ""recruits"" that the present Governor sent Mr. Dalrymple to interfere in a quarrel in Crippee, far outside any English claim; and the unfortunate gentleman, a Houssa, the poor chief they had seized and tied, and a number of Crippees have lost their lives, because Sir W. B. Griffith is determined they shall see he is Governor. Twenty years ago, people who went to Crippee to trade were especially warned that they went there at their own risk and were not to look to the Government for redress, as it was beyond their jurisdiction. Several times lately men have gone to the Judges with complaints, and have been told there was no help for them as it was not in their jurisdiction. And the Governor is the only person who does not know this! To these places he sends to seize the chiefs, and when the natives resist the capture of their chief and the officer (as well as the chief) loses his life, towns are bombarded and women and children massacred. The fact of these people having remained and kept the women and children in the towns, is pretty plain proof that they had nothing to do with the quarrel, and, therefore, nothing to fear. Of course it will be said they were all in it. It is easy for certain people to say anything. ""I do the wrong, then first begin to brawl."" It is natural that the Governor should try to shift the blame upon other shoulders, but in sending an officer where he had no right to send him, he, and he alone, is responsible for the consequences. Does it ever enter into his calculations that he is driving these Crippees, who under good and just government might have voluntarily offered themselves to British rule, to seek shelter under the German flag? Sale of munitions of war is forbidden as far as to Quittah; but the Germans are next door to Quittah. They may do good business with the Crippees, and then tell them, ""Give your country to us; we will hoist our flag, and you will be safe.""—Yours, &c.,'}]","[{'document_title': 'Mr. Hutton on West African Affairs', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Manchester, February 25, 1873.\n\nTo the Directors of the Chamber of Commerce, Manchester.\n\nGentlemen,—The present unsatisfactory state of the trade of the West Coast of Africa induces me to request your immediate and earnest consideration to the condition of the British settle- ments there, and to the manner in which the commercial in- terests of this country on that coast are neglected by Her Majesty's Government.\n\nWherever slavery has existed Her Majesty's Government has ever been eager and the first to avenge at any expense the cause of the poor negro; the mere suspicion of slavery has always brought to the spot one of Her Majesty's ships of war; but\n123\n\nBritish merchants on the West Coast of Africa are most heavily, arbitrarily, and exorbitantly taxed by Her Majesty's Government to support the officers they send out, and the traders appeal in vain for that protection to their lives and property and for that consideration to their interests to which they have every moral and just claim.\n\nThe injustice British traders suffer from this want of protection has most materially weakened their influence over the natives, and in many parts the only evidence of British rule in Western Africa is the presence of the tax-collector.\n\nThe British merchants also suffer most grievously from the commercial ignorance and utter incapacity of the officials sent out by the Colonial-office; the improper appointments and the constant and frequent changes made in the Administration are, in fact, the main causes of the present unsatisfactory state of the settlements and of the trade of the West African Coast.

The memorial pointed out that the occupations by France and the late annexations by Germany of small portions of the West Coast of Africa tended to break the continuity of the British protectorate, and to bring about a greater conflict of national interests. The influence of the British authorities with the natives was lessened, and the introduction of different principles of trading seriously affected the prosperity of British trades. The duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnished the greater portion of the Government revenues. In German and French settlements these articles were free from duty, and being to a great extent sold in the same markets as the British goods, competition became so keen that the loss to British revenue and trade must ultimately be very great. The Committee recommended that the Chamber should ask the Foreign Office that while negotiations regarding African territories were pending, something might be done, by exchange or otherwise, to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from the ports where British trade had become established, and where rivalry upon different commercial and political principles was so injurious. The Government might also take into consideration the extension of the British protectorate to the unoccupied portions of the coast alluded to. It was moved that the Chamber should forward to the Foreign Office a memorial on the lines of that submitted by the African Trade Section. This resolution was unanimously agreed to. At the same meeting a letter was read which had been received from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, asking the Liverpool Chamber to join in a petition to Lord Granville respecting the claims of Portugal on the Congo. The petition stated that authentic information had been received that Portugal was again bringing forward its former pretensions to hold and exercise authority over both banks of the Congo and the adjacent territories, and pointed out the necessity of immediate and effectual steps being taken to secure the renunciation, on the part of Portugal, of any attempt to interfere with the rights of British traders and with the jurisdiction on either side of the Congo and on the adjacent territory.

F. Hutton, President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, in his address at the annual meeting of the Chamber on Feb. 1, said that a matter which had engaged the attention of the directors was our trade with West Africa, particularly in the neighbourhood of the rivers Niger and Binue. They had to complain very much of the apathy manifested by the resident officials of Her Majesty's Government, who taxed the goods, but declined to afford any protection or assistance to British merchants. Those officials seemed to have an idea that they were sent out to rule and not to assist as much as possible in the development of British trade. Owing to the state of affairs which had been allowed to arise in the localities indicated, the trade in this country had suffered a very marked decline, for whereas in 1884 we sent 106,000,000 yards of cotton goods, representing a value of £1,320,000, we only sent last year 73,000,000 yards, or a money value of £851,000. He submitted that the Government ought to take prompt measures to protect the lives and property of British subjects in West Africa, and so assist in extending a very valuable market for English manufactures. They had just heard that last May, on the invitation of the German Government, Her Majesty's Government gave to Germany an assurance that a Congo International Conference should be pledged to the British Protectorate in the Niger, that only moderate duties should be levied, and that those should only be levied for the purpose of paying the expenses necessary to carry out the obligations of the Protectorate. At the same time it was understood that there should be no monopolies there, and those concessions were made without giving those who were really owners of property in the territories any voice in the country whatever. Two of the special objects of the merchants in obtaining these concessions from the natives and in obtaining the treaties of sovereignty and territory were that we should do the very utmost we could to stop the importation of spirits into the districts. That trade had increased very considerably during the last few years, and it was one of the curses which European countries were introducing into uncivilized countries, and would tend to retard the progress of our trade and the progress of civilization in the interior of Africa. He thought it was a discredit almost to the Powers of Europe that when great and earnest endeavours were made to limit the import of spirits into these places, there was an almost unanimous opinion expressed against it except by England. Another object which these merchants had in making these treaties was that there should also be some limit put upon the importation of arms and gunpowder, which was another source of evil, and constantly causing wars and raids on our trade."", 'last_edit_date': '1886-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1886#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed. A large portion of the trade was doubtless in slaves, but still that alone could never have accounted for the prosperity and wealth of the merchants who traded with Western Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE EFFECT', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'THE EFFECT of the lately popular laissez-faire policy of the Government with regard to the British colonies and settlements in West Africa is beginning to make itself most unpleasantly realised. For months past it has been pointed out that the French and other European nations were gradually bearing in upon the irregularly defined boundaries of our authority towards the interior; and now the constriction of the annexation band which the recent settlements of the French have completed around the eastern and northern limits of the British sphere in West Africa is beginning to be most painfully felt upon our trade and intercourse with the interior. From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia. The Governor has investigated the circumstances attending the hauling-down of the Union Jack at two stations in the interior. In one case it was found that the district was distinctly under British protection; the other was about ""forty yards outside the British limit."" Doubtless, this is a near thing; but the rule the French, with the rest of our rivals, are in the habit of applying is, that ground which cannot be proved to belong to us must belong to them. Since the downfall of the Spanish Colonial Empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Great Britain has been...\n\ntill lately, the only European Power of the first rank which has devoted its energies to the construction of an Empire outside the geographical limits of its own home. In the absence of rivals, the course has been comparatively clear; and it seems difficult for Governments to realise that all this has been changed during the last two decades. If we would maintain the Empire which has been handed down to us by the enterprise and enthusiasm of the last nine generations, it can only be done by a ready recognition of the fact that other nations around us are only too eager to circumvent our plans, and to take advantage of every slip and inaction on our part.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1893#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Produce Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that has just expired has witnessed the continuance and, indeed, the aggravation of that painful depression in the trade of West Africa which existed in 1886.

In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall.

During the past fifteen years its northern frontier had been constantly harassed by the inroads of the Mohammedans, who had made Ilorin their centre of operations towards the south, and by that renewed pressure from the north the inhabitants of Yoruba had not only been cut off from their former sources of supplies in that direction, but had also been forced to submit to the exactions and commercial blockade of their weaker kinsmen who inhabit the neighbourhood of the Gulf lagoons. These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands.

The continual wars led to slave catching, and the result was that the trade routes to the interior were, with few exceptions, closed to traffic, and it was more difficult for a trader to penetrate beyond the coast line than for a Mohammedan to traverse the desert of Sahara.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

The General History of Africa details how the British employed a mix of diplomacy and force to establish dominance, exemplified by the 1892 invasion of Ijebu after their refusal to comply with British demands. The British also imposed governing councils on Delta states, removing leaders like Jaja of Opobo who resisted their trade regulations, and used inter-state wars to open trade routes for their traders and missionaries, mediating peace treaties to serve their interests rather than fostering genuine local peace. The textbook highlights the British tactic of ""divide and conquer,"" exploiting African rivalries, though it does not explicitly mention the Egba in the context of obstructed mediation efforts. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the British reluctance to cooperate with local mediation, as seen when a deputation from Lagos was discouraged from pursuing peace negotiations in Ibadan. The articles underscore the British focus on opening trade routes despite ongoing troubles with the Ijebu and Egba tribes, illustrating their prioritization of trade and resource extraction. The imposition of British authority over the Oil Rivers and changes in trade regulations further highlight this emphasis.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897.

They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era.

That the British had accomplished so much in Yorubaland by 1886 should not surprise us. Apart from the activities of the European traders and missionaries, which had preceded the wars, after fighting among themselves since the 1850s, the Yoruba were themselves war-weary and needed peace; hence their acceptance of the intervention by the British. The only state in Yorubaland that had effectively resisted the missionaries, the British traders, and the Lagos administration, until the 1880s was Ijebu.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

The British had clashed with King William Pepple of Bonny as early as 1854, when they exiled him to Fernando Po, Ascension, Sierra Leone and London. They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence.

Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 536, 'article_title': 'MEMORIAL OF SIERRA LEONE RESIDENTS AT LAGOS TO COMMISSIONER ORD.', 'full_section_title': 'MEMORIAL OF SIERRA LEONE RESIDENTS AT LAGOS TO COMMISSIONER ORD.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1865#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_02_1865', 'content': ""Your memorialists feel convinced that had a less demonstrative establishment been kept, a more conciliatory policy pursued, a regard for native rights and privileges been acknowledged, and a promulgation to the natives given out, the sum and substance of the British Government's views in reference to their relations with neighbouring kings and chiefs, and of the Government's intentions as regards annexation of territories from native kings and chiefs, that better feelings would be engendered, suspicions removed, confidence restored, and consequently peace and prosperity.\n\nYour memorialists deeply regret to state that the authorities of this settlement have since the occupation of Lagos as a British colony broken through that unity which existed between the European residents and educated native Africans in Lagos.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans.

This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs.

I used to go to Lagos (where I belong to) sometimes for change on account of health, and returned to the said mentioned Jaja, and since then from the war of 1869, which brought us all to this river (Opobo), when only two Europeans entered this river, Mr. Sterling, agent for Charles Horsfall and Son, came in the river and traded with Jaja and his chiefs. At first, Consul Livingstone refused to protect them, but by much complaining to the Foreign-office in London, he was obliged to protect them. All their letters regarding the same were written by me, although I am an African born; I am obliged to act on the part of Jaja; and since the war was finished in January, 1873, trading has been going on very briskly. I, myself, am only trying with what little wages I got from Jaja during the time I was working for him. I asked permission of King Jaja to try to trade a little in the only way I then could—i.e., by bringing country clothes from Lagos to Opobo to be bartered for palm oil. The King agreed to this in consideration of the long time I was with him. I tried my best to pick up some few casks of palm oil with the country cloths, and against the time of my shipping oil, I took the oil on board the steamship Forcados, British and African Steam Navigation Company, to ship this oil to Liverpool. The captain refused to receive the oil, stating that the chairman in this river refused to allow him to receive any oil from us in the town, even from the natives. Since then, I have never been allowed to ship my oil to Liverpool. I did not know what to do; I had written to the agents of the Company, but received no reply. I cannot write to the Consul anything respecting it, as I believe the Consul is all for the Europeans in this river, because the Consul once asked King Jaja why he did not send away every Sierra Leone and Lagos man from his town.

Some of the natives, however, after bringing in their war-canoes, repented doing so, and when night came on they went to the wharf to take the canoes away. On three occasions this was done successfully, but the natives had not got far away when the electric search-light was thrown on the river.

The town presented a most horrible and revolting sight. Men, women, and children ran through the town drinking mugs of human blood. At their ju-ju house the head men held a festival, where the flesh of the victims was devoured. Some of it was salted and dried to be eaten at leisure.

These are cultivated not only by the people of the settlement, but also by the natives from the interior, Serawoollies, Tillichbunkas, and other nomadic tribes who occupy or hire from the owners land on the banks of the creeks and rivers, and in some instances to a distance of forty miles inland, and with the assistance of their domestic slaves, plant the nut about the end of June and reap it at Christmas. It is calculated that one man can work an acre of land which should produce about 300 bushels, worth about 30l.\n\nThe trade is comparatively of recent origin, having only commenced in 1845, in which year the value of the export was but 199l.; in 1858, it had reached 188,000l.; of late years, owing principally to the war amongst the native tribes, it has somewhat fallen off, and in 1864 the value of the crop was only 78,000l.

It is also to be feared that the cultivation of cotton, requiring attention during a considerable portion of the year, and being necessarily carried on in the same spot, will be unsuited to the habits of the wandering tribes engaged in growing the ground-nut, a cultivation which only requires their absence from home during four months of the year, and which they can carry on wherever they please on paying a percentage for the use of the land.\n\nMoreover, a cotton plantation is liable to destruction at any time when war may break out in its neighbourhood, whilst ground-nuts are exposed to this very common danger during only one-third of the year.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Thus as early as the 1860s, at a time when the French and British governments were generally opposed to colonial acquisitions in Africa, the special circumstances of this particular African locality had already involved the two most active European nations in a struggle for territorial possession. The Anglo-French convention of August 1863 actually agreed on a partition of the area between the two powers, with the Yewa river, about 20 km west of what became the border in 1889, as the agreed boundary. The French and British declarations of protectorates in the area between 1862 and 1863 did not enjoy official ratification and had to be abandoned in the 1870s. But the struggle was resumed again in the 1880s, partly because of the entry of Germany into the race and partly because of renewed invasions by Dahomey which increased the determination of the rulers of Porto Novo and the states of western Yorubaland to seek protection from the French or the British. The French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, the AngloFrench Partition of Borgu in 1895, the extension of British rule over the rest of Yorubaland and their conquest of Benin in 1897 must be seen as the logical conclusion of the Anglo-French rivalry of the 1860s, itself provoked by the pre-existing unities of the hinterland of the ports the European powers tried to control on the coast.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in French West Africa, 1880-1900', 'content': ""It is quite clear from the available evidence that the French - from 1880 onwards - adopted a policy of extending their control over the whole region from the Senegal first to the Niger and then Chad and linking these areas with their posts on the Guinea coast in Ivory Coast and Dahomey.

As one would expect, therefore, in their occupation of West Africa, the French resorted almost exclusively to the method of military conquest rather than the conclusion of treaties of protectorate as the British did. In terms of African reactions, all the options open to them were resorted to, namely, submission, alliance and confrontation. However, as will be seen below, far more of the rulers opted for the strategy of militant confrontation than those of submission and alliance while opposition here was far more protracted than anywhere else in West Africa for two main reasons. The first, as pointed out already, was that the French used the method of military conquest almost exclusively, which consequently evoked militant reaction. The second was that the people were far more Islamized than those of the other areas of West Africa, and as Michael Crowder has pointed out, since 'for Muslim societies of West Africa the imposition of white rule meant submission to the infidel which was intolerable to any good Muslim',$^{2}$ they tended to resist the Europeans with added fervour and tenacity often lacking among nonMuslims.

The eclipse of the Benin port of Ughoton dem¬ onstrated quite painfully to Benin that the days of its near monopoly of coastal trade had ended.\nThe coastal trade encouraged the spirit of political autonomy among the Itsekiri. This eventually led to a situation of war between the Olu of Warri and the qba of Benin, and the new wealth also nourished political conflicts within the Warri kingdom itself. There was, for example, so much rivalry and acrimony, so many succession disputes, protest migrations and the setting up of autonomous and rival power centres that for the rest of the century no generally acceptable successor could be found for the stool of the Olu of Warri when Akengbua, the incumbent from 1809, died in 1848. As with the Itsekiri kingdom, Agbor, whose monarchy had also been organized on the Benin model and operated as a Benin dependency, grew steadily into an autonomous state again largely under the influence of the new coastal trade. Ovonramwen, the last Oba of independent Benin, was determined to reinvigorate the kingdom and this policy included an expedition against Agbor with a view to re-asserting Benin authority there.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries.

The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley.

The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans.

Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': ""It was neither a deliberate policy on the part of British colonial rulers which saved the land in British West Africa for the Africans during the inter-war period, nor was it because of the notorious reputation that West Africa had acquired as 'the White Man's Grave' by the late nineteenth century.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 572, 'article_title': 'Parliamentary Intelligence', 'full_section_title': 'Parliamentary Intelligence', 'last_edit_date': '02-21-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1865#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_03_1865', 'content': ""\n\nMr. Cave, in seconding the resolution, said he did not wish to be understood as concurring in all the observations of the right hon. gentleman. If, however, he had urged no other reason in support of his motion than the length of time that had elapsed since inquiry had taken place, he thought he was entitled to carry it. The investigation which took place in 1842 was held with a different object from that now on view, when the idea was all but universally entertained that no amount of money was too great to expend for the civilization of the African. A feeling, however, now prevailed that to tax this country heavily for such a purpose was rather going beyond the proper duty of the House. He quite agreed with the right hon. gentleman that the question of the slave-trade was one of supply and demand. At the same time, an important element which had not been alluded to entered into the question—namely, that of price. The present price of slaves was the only obstacle to the demand for them, being ten times as great as formerly. (Hear, hear.) He believed that if the blockading squadron were removed, if the settlements were suddenly taken away, the price of slaves would fall to such an extent, that the demand would enormously increase, and the supply follow; and that the Government of Spain, which he hoped was contemplating a different policy, would find the temptation to allow a continuance of the trade too strong for them to resist. (Hear, hear.) There could be no doubt that the settlements were in an unsatisfactory state, and he believed they had been conducted upon false principles from the beginning. Under the recommendation of the committee of 1842, crowds of recaptured Africans were maintained in idleness at the public expense, at a time when labourers in this country were only able to obtain precarious, and in many cases insufficient, means of livelihood. He agreed with his right hon. friend, that the suppression of the slave-trade was to be accomplished rather by concentration of means than by spreading them over a large surface. There was no reason to believe that the slave-trade was not going on along the West Coast of Africa, but there were no captures, because the fastest vessels on the coast were the slavers. The greatest speed of Her Majesty's cruisers was eight knots, while the slavers could make perhaps sixteen knots. (Hear, hear.) He could not go so far as to say that these settlements should be done away with; it might have been wrong to place them there in the first instance, and they might have been badly administered, but it would be impossible suddenly to suppress them. If they were suppressed the loss would be very great; other nations would probably take them up, and it would not be wise, he thought, to give to France a greater share of power on the West Coast of Africa. All these settlements had a considerable revenue, and he did not see why with better administration they might not be self-supporting. Sierra Leone had a revenue of 30,000l. a-year, but the expenditure was very great, the salaries alone having risen from 17,000l. in 1860 to 20,000l. in 1862. There was a mixed commission there, it was true, but it was a bad place for a mixed commission; vessels had to beat up to it; and few cases, therefore, had been taken there for adjudication. One of the subjects which the committee would have to investigate was the reason that while the imports and exports from the whole of the Coast had increased from 3,000,000l. to 4,000,000l., the commerce of the British settlements had decreased. It had been asked, what would be the use of the occupation of these stations, if the slave-trade was at an end? But they were useful for the prevention of piracy, and for the protection of British vessels in other parts of the Coast. The committee of 1842, which was founded upon a commission, examined a great many witnesses—Dr. Madden, who was the principal, and a number of naval and military officers who had been out on the Coast in question; and it would be a great pity if this inquiry should be conducted without sufficient witnesses of the best kind, and should fail in consequence of obtaining only speculative evidence.

When therefore we undertook the work we are at present carrying on for the West Coast of Africa, we not only made a review of the past, and an examination of the actual state of affairs there, but set ourselves to consider what might and ought to be the future of those several countries over which the British flag was then and is now flying. To have merely occupied ourselves with the present, to have been merely chroniclers and critics of the month\'s events and proceedings, official, social, and material, would have made our task comparatively an easy one. But we should have felt like a mariner at sea without a compass, and steering for a port, latitude and longitude unknown. No permanent good could be thus achieved; the day\'s necessities and demands, the satisfaction of immediate and personal interests, would be paramount and supreme. And we now fear (and we say it with all respect) is the position and condition of the British Colonial-offices with regard to West Africa; in which Downing-street is but the reflex of the national mind. West Africa has been associated in public opinion with the slave-trade only. Our ""forts and settlements"" on the Coast have come into national possession, for the most part, through previous slave-trade occupancy, or for slave-trade repression; and so little had our public men ever thought of a future for them, that the great political party out of which the existing administration is formed, advocated ostensively in 1864 and 1865 to get rid of them for us altogether; while the Parliamentary Committee which sat to incubate this brilliant and statesmanlike idea (!) gave such prominence in its examination of witnesses to the question of whether those places on the West Coast were still necessary, or indispensable to the suppression of the slave-trade, as could not fail to give every one the impression that they did not think them nationally worth retaining on any other than anti-slavery trade grounds. It is not strange, then, that we should have had so often to complain of the evident want of some definite idea, some fixed principle, some ulterior policy, some large and comprehensive views with regard to the future of the population on that extensive and important Coast of Western Africa; but to us who regard each act of British rule there as the germ and nucleus of a future African nation, Christian, civilized, and prosperous, whose growth and development and future peace may be jeopardized thereby, it is deeply painful, though not surprising. And out of this deep pain comes one of our heaviest duties, that of striving to bring about such a change of public opinion in Great Britain with regard to Africa as shall lead to the adoption of a wise, noble, and generous policy on the part of the British Government towards our colonies and settlements on the West Coast. We do not for a moment conceal from ourselves the difficulties that are in our way; but we believe in those future African nations; we see how the British Government, without any intention of creating such, has been, and is being, made the reluctant agent in so doing; we recognize in this the action of an Omnipotent directing Power; and we feel the conviction that if we are right in our belief in those future African nations, the course of events, directed by unerring Wisdom overruling man\'s acts, will ere long work mightily with us against the apathy and indifference with which our public men now regard so important a subject as the future of the still far from depopulated countries lying upon and behind that long coast line of Western Africa—countries unsurpassed by any other on the earth in tropical fertility, and as lying so near to Europe rendered immensely more valuable thereby. When we commenced the African Times we were thought strangely mistaken in our ideas that the gradually increasing education on the Coast might be successfully appealed to; but every year has shown us an increasing interest felt by educated Africans there in those great questions, by the solution of which the more or less rapid advancement of the African countries now under British rule or protection will be determined. And our confidence daily increases, together with the conviction of the increasing necessity for our exertions. The imminent danger of the occupation of the River Melicourie by the French, in consequence of the utter disregard of Governor Blackall, notwithstanding the dreadful blow such an occupation must necessarily give to Sierra Leone as a British colony and future African State, affords a fresh evidence of the need of West Africa being carefully watched by those who do not look upon her countries and her people as doomed to unending barbarism and oppression, but as in course of preparation for, and gradual advancement to, Christian civilization, with the incalculable blessings that follow in its train—to security, freedom, and wealth. It has long been our intention to lay clearly before our readers in Africa and in England that future which we have conceived and believe in as'}, {'id': 3803, 'article_title': 'The French at Matacong', 'full_section_title': 'The French at Matacong', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1879#article-13', 'issue_date': '01_05_1879', 'content': ""We do not like the news brought by the Senegal from Sierra Leone relative to the Island of Matacong; and yet we cannot bring our mind to believe that Governor Rowe should have been seized by the insane desire to imitate Lord Lytton and Sir Bartle Frere, and get up a little beginning of hostilities with the French. He will doubtless, we think, have recollected that the French are not exactly like Afghans or Zulus, any more than he is like Sir Bartle Frere or Lord Lytton. Yet it would seem so easy to send a few soldiers, as public rumour suggested, to pull down one flag and hoist another in its place, that we shall feel relieved when another steamer arrives with the intelligence that so insane a suggestion has not been listened to. That the continued British possession of Matacong is of vast importance to Sierra Leone, its trade and revenue, there cannot be the shadow of a doubt. It is therefore with pain we say that we do not feel by any means confident of the future British possession of Matacong. We see that the cession of 1826 is relied upon; but Sir George Grey repudiated that title, and we never took official possession. The French Government treat the matter in a very friendly spirit, as might be expected, stating it to be one for calm discussion between them and that of Great Britain. But we very much distrust the issue of this calm discussion. Neither Government will, we suppose, be inclined to give way. Then will come the proposal for an arbitration, which, of course, we shall feel bound to accept, and—which is also a matter of course, if we may judge by former experience of the results of similar arbitrations—the arbitrator's decision will be against the British claim, and the French will take full possession; acquiring thereby something additional to offer in exchange for the Gambia. For we still feel, as we have ever done, that the entire action of the French Government in the Sierra Leone rivers has had but one real end in view, but one supreme aim, and that is to obtain the River Gambia in exchange. We shall be glad to find that we are wrong, but we greatly fear that our misgivings will be justified by events. If our counsel and remonstrances had been listened to many years ago, this and other French dangers to Sierra Leone would have been nipped in the bud. They have been allowed to blossom and ripen into fruit that will, we fear, prove to be both disagreeable and dangerous to the interests of the metropolitan colony of the West Coast of Africa.""}, {'id': 3813, 'article_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'full_section_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1879#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_08_1879', 'content': '""The only present available road from the Upper Gambia to Sego for travellers is the northern one, passing through Wooli and Boudou to Senadaboo, the capital of that country, of which Barcarry Sadou is king. From thence the road goes through Kasson to the capital of that country, Madina, the king of which is brother-in-law to Barcarry Sadou. From this point the road goes to Kuniacarry, the frontier town of Bamburra, and thence to Sego. But as far as English interests are concerned this line is useless, as it passes too close to the French posts on the Senegal, and Barcarry Sadou is but a feudatory of France. Thus the road could any day be stopped to British commerce, even if the enormous Customs duties charged did not prohibit trade with Gambia. Thus the only available route for British trade is that already mentioned—from Yarburtenda, on the south bank of the Gambia, via Jellacotta. Now, Amadu, King of Sego, has, for the past three years, been most anxious to have a visit from an Englishman as the pioneer of the opening of trade with Gambia; and as he has either direct control over, or else tributary relations with, the countries between Bamburra and the head-waters of the Gambia, he can, once arrangements are made, easily open the southern road to Yarburtenda, and protect it afterwards. At present, not only do our Government give us no assistance whatever in pushing the trade in the Upper Gambia, but they throw obstacles in our way. They refuse to protect our trade, yet charge duties on imports and exports; and two years ago, when an English merchant wanted to build a large depot in the upper river, protect it by a stockade, and place men in it to defend it against marauders, the Administrator actually wrote to that merchant, and told him that if he built a stockade and armed his men, he (the Administrator) would notify to the natives that the merchant had no right to be there.

While, on the other hand, if we turn to France, we see all is activity and energy there, and that, as matters at present portend, she is likely to take England's place in the commercial race in West Africa; and in the long run the volatile Latin race will overshadow and oust the energetic, proud, and great Anglo-Saxon one, and France will get Gambia.\n\nWhile the English are doing literally nothing—have not advanced a mile into the interior the past thirty years, keeping always to the coast-line—France has pushed up the Senegal to Medina, 750 miles from St. Louis, and occupied that place.\n\nThree expeditions under French auspices leave the Northwest Coast for the interior about next November: (1) one from Senegal, under M. Soleillet, which is to penetrate, via Macina, to Timbuctoo, on the Upper Niger, to open trade relations with that place; this is under the direct patronage of the French Government, and will work in connection with the intended surveying party for the Algiers, Senegal, and Soudan Railway; (2) an expedition leaves the Pongo River about the same time to penetrate to Sego on the Upper Niger; and (3) further south, again, another expedition leaves Sierra Leone for the country east of the Loma Mountains, and will penetrate to the great district embraced by the Kong Mountains on the west and the Niger River on the east.

In that letter I said that among other places the French intended to survey and eventually occupy was Farabuna, a town in Bouree, about sixty miles east of the forks of the Gambia river, and close to the gold mines. Well, early in April a French medical official had instructions to start for North-west Africa, and visit the Bambouk, Mandingo, and Bouree countries, the Futa Jallon highlands, and go on to Timbo, as the principal commercial centre for the latter region. Thus you see the French are determined in time to shut us out from the interior, and confine us to the Atlantic seaboard.\n\nThe English expedition to Timbo has got there. Dr. Gouldsbury and his men have returned here, but whatever the results have been are only known to the Home Government; but it is remarkable that French newspapers say that had the English expedition attempted to penetrate beyond Timbo they would have been stopped.

In July, 1879, I saw Sir Michael Hicks-Beach in London, and told him I was ready to proceed to Sego at once, and had all the capital subscribed for opening and establishing a trade with that place from Gambia, that I could obtain a treaty of commerce with King Amadu, of Sego, giving a monopoly to British Trade. All I asked was for the Government to grant a monopoly to such trade as far as the Gambia was concerned, and allow us the goods imported duty free for, say, ten years from Yarbutenda. This was refused; I was told that I could go there at my own risk. Of course, I was quite aware of that, and no thanks to H.B.M.'s Government; but then, as soon as I had opened the road to Sego, and established a good trade with the head natives of the Gambia at heavy expense, which only a monopoly of several years could repay, the local Government at Gambia would encourage any and every one to crowd up the Upper Gambia, and by undue competition destroy the trade to the Niger as a profitable commercial speculation, just in order to gain for their revenue more customs, duties at the out-port of Bathurst, to be hoarded as a useless surplus, or expended on the staff and imperial pensioners. Many years ago a certain Administrator here, who was under obligations to the agent of a French house, at which time the French houses could not trade up the river beyond the ports of Bathurst and Albrida, His Excellency told that if he got permission from the Government to allow the French houses to trade in any part of the river it would be to his advantage. He used his influence with the Colonial Office, and the request was granted. Nothing more was heard about the debt. Knowing of this case I was determined to be on the safe side. Well, as the Home Government would do nothing the whole scheme fell to the ground, as I was aware, and so were my friends in England, that unless the expedition started at the end of 1879, we should be too late—the French would get there before us; and I warned Sir Michael Hicks-Beach of this. That my warning was only too true the following extract from the Moniteur du Sénégal proves. It is the text of a treaty made lately between Colonel Galleeni, who went to Sego nearly two years ago, and Amadu, king of that empire:—\n\nArticle 1st. Gives to France the right to establish trading posts, to the exclusion of all other nations.\n\nArticle 2nd. The right to navigate the Upper Niger.\n\nArticle 3rd.

The remedies are—first, such alteration of the laws as will protect the honest and punish the dishonest; second, a stop to be put to the civil wars in the Badiboo and Jolah countries; third, to encourage the natives to raise some other kinds of produce besides ground nuts, produce that will be more valuable and not so expensive to handle as ground nuts; fourth, to open the road from Jellacotta, on the Upper Gambia, to the gold fields in Neolo, a distance of 70 to 100 miles, to work such mines and protect them from marauders.

Lagos and Porto Novo, as one of the editors writes, are naturally, from their relative positions, parts of a single State; neither of them is, or can ever be, from physical, economical, and social reasons, complete without the other. This has been long since urged upon the British Government. Sir John Glover, when Governor of Lagos, was deeply penetrated by this truth, and, if our memory serves us aright, made strong representations to Downing Street of the absolute necessity (if Lagos was to fulfil the hopes entertained of her, and realize the objects in view when she was annexed) of the barbarous rule at Porto Novo being put an end to, by the pensioning off of its bloodthirsty ruler, and uniting it with Lagos. Nothing could seem to be more hopeless than any progress of civilization in Porto Novo while it should remain under native rule. King Tofa, the present ruler, has followed in the way of his predecessors, slaughtering no small number of human victims. It will, perhaps, be said that if this be the case, we ought to welcome the French protectorate there. This we cannot do, for at least two good reasons. First, that the place must, ere long, have been united with Lagos; and, secondly, that we do not believe the declaration of a French protectorate will exercise any beneficial influence. As from its position with regard to Lagos, and the channels of access to it from the sea, France cannot possibly turn the protectorate to any profitable account, we do not believe that she will, in any way, interfere with King Tofa\'s humane government. In the course of the correspondence which has appeared in the London papers about the New Hebrides, &c., we found it gravely stated that the French Government certainly would not do such a thing, because ""it would be an unfriendly act."" Now, a more unfriendly act than this declaration of a protectorate over Porto Novo we could scarcely conceive. France had no interests there, commercial or other, to protect, and the only safe approach to Porto Novo for merchandise is from within the Bar of Lagos, which is British. Cargo can occasionally be landed on the sea beach, from which it has then to be transported by hand to the town, but as the sea breaks heavily on that beach outside Lagos Bar, the operation is a risky one. So fully was this peculiar circumstance of situation and approach admitted, that with the first news of the declaration of a protectorate came also the rumour that the French Government would make a canal from the sea beach to the town—about as absurd an idea as could possibly be conceived; and although some strange projects seem to have got of late into French administrative minds, such a one as this is at least beyond the bounds of probability. However reputedly rich France may be, yet, with a population that has ceased to increase, with a revenue that for the present has ceased to be elastic, and with a very high and yearly increasing ordinary annual expenditure, she is not likely to throw away some millions in so unfruitful an enterprise as the attempt to cut such a canal would be. We cannot help, therefore, expressing anew our unfeigned regret that the French Government should have authorized or approved of such a measure as the assuming a protectorate over Porto Novo, which cannot bring to her anything but loss of honour, or expense without equivalent benefit. In its cry of distress The Lagos Times makes a remark which has just now, and will continue to have, a much wider application than to this matter of which it treats. The Editor says: ""Little as England, on her own account, cares for such an acquisition [as Porto Novo], she should not so much have disregarded our interest in the matter, which is real, while it would be difficult to ascertain the extent of French interest in it; without driving out the Germans, which she would scarcely venture to do, or imposing unjust restrictions on their trade, her own trade [that of France] cannot be improved by the step."" We have long foreseen that this diversity of interests between Great Britain and her colonies and settlements abroad must arise. The British Government very reasonably desires to limit the extent of its obligations beyond the seas. The Colonial Office is far from adequate to a proper performance of the work that at present devolves upon it; and as the Imperial revenue does not derive any direct benefit from colonial possessions and settlements, while each added one brings with it some new involvements, the British Government looks with an unfavourable eye upon annexations which are, perhaps, of vital interest to its colonies. We have before us, at the present time, the difference of opinion and sentiment between the Mother Country and the Australian Colonies as regards New Guinea and New Hebrides. The Australian Colonies, now growing so rapidly in wealth and population, are naturally on their outlook as regards their future. They say to the British Government: ""Yes, very likely New Guinea and the New Hebrides are of little or no consequence to you, but our interest in their acquisition is a vital one: the Australian countries must have regard to their future, and they do not feel that that future will be what it ought to be unless New Guinea and the New Hebrides are secured from falling into the hands of some other European Power."" A letter which we publish in this present number expresses the apprehension of the British and Native traders in the Trans-Volta district of the Gold Coast Colony, that if the British Government will not authorize that of the Gold Coast to annex the small but commercially important residue of the Coast up to the boundaries of Dahomey (which the legitimate native authorities have more than once prayed the local British Government of the Gold Coast to receive into that colony), it will ere long be taken possession of by the French. This would be another most ""unfriendly act,"" it is true; but after the affair of Porto Novo, we ought to be on our guard, particularly as some daring opposers of the legitimate chiefs hoisted the French flag some time ago. It was from prevision that something of this kind might happen that, some twenty years ago, we advised and assisted in obtaining the annexation of the Sherbro\' countries, as an appendage to the colony of Sierra Leone; and that we advised the annexation of the River countries near Sierra Leone, where French influences have since prevailed to the injury of the colony. We do think that in such cases as Porto Novo, and, again, as the Popos, the British Government should be more alive to the necessity of protecting the interests of its colonies and settlements abroad.'}, {'id': 5104, 'article_title': 'SHRINKAGE OF EMPIRE.', 'full_section_title': 'SHRINKAGE OF EMPIRE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_05_1885', 'content': 'A short time ago, while the Congo Conference was sitting, England declared the navigation of the Gambia River, on the West Coast of Africa, open to the commerce of all nations. There was a certain appearance of magnanimity about the act; and magnanimous it might really have been under different circumstances. As a matter of fact, the Government were compelled to do what they did by the squeezing-out process which the French have been so quietly but relentlessly employing against us in that region. This policy was carried on with much determination during the Second Empire, but has been pursued more vigorously than ever since the conclusion of the war with Germany. On the 10th of this month Reuter\'s agents informed us that a French officer, a Captain Combes, had taken up an excellent position on the Upper Niger; that three posts—Bamakou, Kondou, and Bafoulabé—were provisioned for twelve months, and telegraphic communication established between them. They further added that the launch of the French gunboat now on the Niger was preparing to descend the stream to Timbuctoo with the rising of the waters. At first sight there may appear nothing of importance in all this; but a glance at the map will show that it is a serious step towards the barring out of British trade with that part of the interior of Africa.\n\nAs far back as 1849 one of the most energetic and far-seeing of the Governors of the Gambia—the late Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell—writing to Earl Grey on his travels in Bondou, a fertile territory between the Upper Gambia and Senegal, says: ""I had frequent interviews with the Almamy, or the Mohammedan Sovereign of Bondou, and was successful in inducing him to enter into an agreement to protect travellers through his country to the Gambia, on receiving certain annual presents from the merchants. I was also equally successful in making a similar agreement with the King of Woolli—both which agreements subsist to this day, and, on the whole, have been as faithfully observed by the two kings as could reasonably be expected. I was fortunate enough to prevent at that period the Almamy\'s ratifying a treaty with the French, whereby he was to bind himself to \'shut the roads,\' as it is called, against the \'coffles,\' or country caravans, proceeding from the neighbourhood of the Senegal to the Gambia through his dominions. I actually met in the interior the gentleman sent by the French Government from St. Louis to Bondou for the above purpose, as is mentioned by one of them in the published narrative of their travels.""

The apathetic policy which has been pursued, the systematic ignoring of those who have knowledge and experience, and the entrusting of important interests to incompetent hands, have had the effects which were to be expected, and unless some decisive action is taken soon, we may expect our African trade to go from bad to worse, and be all transferred from London, Liverpool, and Bristol to Hamburg, Havre, and Marseilles.'}, {'id': 5452, 'article_title': 'BRITISH TRADE ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'BRITISH TRADE ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_12_1886', 'content': 'Mr. Eli Sowerbutts has received the following letter from a gentleman who has just returned from the West Coast of Africa:—\n\n""On my passage through Liverpool I observed that you were to read a paper on the \'Recent European Acquisitions in Africa.\' As I have just returned from the Gold Coast Colony, I have had an opportunity of watching the acquisition of other European Powers, which threaten the destruction of British trade in those parts.

In 1882 a Commission was appointed to define the western frontier; they sent in their report, which has been duly filed and ignored, the result being that the French have occupied countries which were formerly British. The French now hold that part of Apollonia north of the Tando River, marked A A A in the map, where they have established stations for the purpose of smuggling goods into British territory. The King of Apollonia is surprised and indignant at this proof of the value of British protection, as he naturally thought that protection has some other meaning besides the payment of Custom duties. The French have also seized Aowin (on the west bank of the Tando, north of Apollonia), which country joined the British protectorate in 1824 or 1825, in the time of Sir Charles Macarthy. They still show with pride the flag given to them on that occasion. They supplied Sir Charles with a large contingent when he fought and was defeated by the Ashantees. Within the last few months the French have annexed Sehwi (north of Aowin and Wassaw). All this is preliminary to the annexation of Ashanti, which will cut us off from all communication with the interior. The Ashantees have recently frequently begged the British Government to assume the protectorate, but have failed to get the question entertained, owing to the want of knowledge of and appreciation of the value of the country by the Colonial Office officials.'}, {'id': 5724, 'article_title': 'Intrigues of the French in West Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Intrigues of the French in West Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1888#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_08_1888', 'content': 'previously used to go by the customary mail routes to Liverpool.

They were informed that an agent of the French Government had been to Abeokuta, and had succeeded in making an agreement for a treaty which was to be ratified by means of presents to the amount of £3,000, to be made in September next. They were given to understand that the object of the treaty was to divert from Lagos the large trade from the interior which came down the river Ogun to Porto Novo. This river was the only waterway for heavy traffic from the interior to Lagos, and whoever was master at Abeokuta could do as they pleased with the trade. The French were now firmly established at Porto Novo, and they had also got control of another small port to the westward, and the fact of their having that port had a great influence on the tariff at Lagos. The French having established themselves on our western border, were now supposed to be working down to Abeokuta on the north. The deputation therefore hoped the Colonial Office would take some steps which would enable them to checkmate the French in that quarter, either by treaties or some small subsidies given to those on our immediate frontier, thus making British influence felt and paramount far outside the limits of British jurisdiction. A long residence at Lagos had convinced him that the most educated and intelligent of the natives appreciated the equal-handed justice with which they were treated under British rule, and would rather see their country under British protection than under any other foreign Power. He would also urge that if the French were allowed to establish themselves at Abeokuta they would be able to make it a basis for interfering with the Niger traffic.\n\nMr. F. Radcliffe said that English traders were placed at a great disadvantage when the French established a colony alongside one of ours, because when trade was bad the French were enabled to come over the border and have the advantage of perfect free trade with our colony, whereas, if we wanted to go into the French colony and trade, all sorts of difficulties were thrown in our way, the goods of English traders were confiscated, and they had no remedy.\n\nMr. Bond said the Liverpool steamship companies trading with the West Coast represented a capital of over a million sterling.

It has been placed in direct telegraphic communication with Paris, and a railway towards the coast is in course of construction. All this, it will be admitted, is rapid and substantial progress; and it is not to be supposed that France will now be content to abandon the dream of extending her dominion from the Niger to the Mediterranean. The Sahara has lost much of its terror and its mystery, and by means of a series of artesian wells it may be possible to overcome all difficulties connected with the supply of water, and to construct a line of railway across the desert from the Senegal or the Niger to Algiers. But there are the tribes to be reckoned with, and it is extremely unlikely that peoples who have hitherto fiercely resented all intrusion will all at once become mild-mannered enough to permit the French or anybody else to build a railway right across their preserves. In any attempt of the kind they would see a covert attack upon the slave trade; and their jealousy of all interference in that regard is notorious. For the present, therefore, the project of a railway across the Saharan desert may be dismissed as chimerical. The fact remains, however, that France has of late obtained a very considerable influence in North-western Africa—an influence of which the progress should be carefully watched in this country.

For want of a better concise name I shall use the vague term ""Central Africa"" to describe the more or less malarious portion of that continent lying between (say) the eighteenth parallels of north and south latitude, exclusive of the maritime regions within twenty or thirty miles of the seaboard, which can look to European fleets for protection of life and property. Central Africa, thus defined, is about thirty times the area of France, and fifty times that of the United Kingdom, and probably contains about one-twelfth of the population of the globe. In the second place, and for the same reason, I use the word ""England"" for ""Great Britain and Ireland,"" and ""Englishmen"" for the inhabitants of this country. ""Britain"" and ""Britons"" are, unfortunately, considered pedantic in prose.\n\nThe Anglo-German and Anglo-Portuguese agreements of 1890 have induced a colonial movement in France which, in this age of electricity, may be described as a strong secondary current. Competent authorities tell us that this agitation is no longer confined to colonial enthusiasts, but has penetrated into the mass of the nation; and a number of expeditions have lately been despatched from widely separated points of the African coast to extend French rights into the heart of the continent. The inadequate recognition in England of this movement may perhaps be attributed to a well-founded belief on the part of ""Our own Correspondents"" that the British public has lately had a surfeit of the Dark Continent.\n\nIt may seem illogical that the demarcation by other countries of spheres of influence in East and South Africa should affect the estimates which France had previously formed of the value of the regions bordering on her possessions in the north and west of the Continent; but it is not in France alone that the fever of annexation proves contagious. To this cause, principally, may be attributed the popularity of propositions for the immediate occupation of vast areas of Central Africa. Two minor causes have contributed to this movement. The first has been the downfall of the Boulangists, who had opposed colonial adventures; partly, no doubt, from a belief in the necessity of concentrating the forces of France at home, and, perhaps, partly from a desire to oppose any policy which had been adopted by their bête noire. Now M. Ferry, having recognised the hegemony of Germany in Europe, had, during his tenure of power, sought to direct the energies of France to compensations abroad.

Besides having lost prestige with the natives of our own sphere, who welcome the French as the conquerors of their oppressors, the Sofas, it seems that now we have earned the enmity of the Sofas themselves. These people, being totally unacquainted with the subtleties by which the Freetown merchants might explain or excuse their action in supplying them with the means of fighting the French, looked at the transaction from the point of view natural to a native, and concluded that the English would help them with men as well as with weapons, when the time came. They fully expected when the tide of war came to Heremakono that the local Government would back them up, and it is possible that their expectations were based upon promises made to them by irresponsible persons engaged in the trade in arms. Finding that they were not helped by us, and finding also that in consequence of the Brussels Convention they could no longer obtain breechloaders from Freetown, they now cry out that they have been deceived, and they have threatened to destroy Falaba. In the meantime they are ravaging and destroying in Kuranko, the most fertile and promising of the Native States in the British sphere, and have already killed and deported hundreds of the Natives. This, then, is the present situation, and the question is, What are we to do? Shall we protect the Natives of our sphere from the tyranny of the Sofas, or shall we leave our hinterland to take care of itself, as we have hitherto done? There is this to be said in favour of the laisser aller policy, that the three-cornered patch of territory, which is all that remains to us as the result of the Conventions with France of 1889 and 1891, is at the present time completely worthless. It produces nothing, and owing to the Sofas international wars, and the overland slave trade, the population has been so thinned that it will be many years before the country can be made valuable agriculturally. Sierra Leone has hitherto chiefly depended on the trade from beyond the Niger, but now that the French have pushed down to the sources of that river, that trade is completely cut off, and will, of course, be diverted to French ports. We can either withdraw altogether to the peninsula of Sierra Leone, and make it and the coaling station a sort of West African Gibraltar, or we can act with vigour in the territory that remains to us, putting down Native wars and protecting life and property, in the hope that when confidence is restored and population increases, products of some sort may be grown; but it would be a very long time before we received any return for our preliminary outlay. In any case, as the Sofas are now engaged in destroying the best part of the territory still left to us, and the Natives, despairing of help from us, are offering their lands to the French, it behoves us to decide quickly what our future policy shall be, otherwise there will soon be nothing left to conserve.  \n—*Pall Mall Gazette.*'}, {'id': 6415, 'article_title': 'FRENCH COLONIAL POLICY IN WEST AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'FRENCH COLONIAL POLICY IN WEST AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1894#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_01_1894', 'content': 'We now come to the last French colony on the West Coast (Gaboon, on the South-west Coast, excluded)—namely, Benin, including the coast towns of Kotonou, Porto Novo, &c., and the newly acquired Protectorate of Dahomey, bounded on the west by German Togoland, and on the east by Lagos and Voruba.

Unfortunately, we find upon examining the question that these arguments do not hold good. In the first place, the French, unfortunately, do not lay claim to these regions in a purely nominal way; it would seem, on the contrary, that they are secured to them by virtue of regular treaties with ourselves and with the native chiefs, if not with our approval, at least with our tacit consent. Secondly, as to their not interfering with our trade: certainly, they have not done so far to any great extent, but everything tends to show that they are beginning to do so in good earnest. The events which are taking place behind Sierra Leone are ample proof of this. French outposts are slowly advancing along our frontier line, and we are continually learning from the local papers of caravans on their way to Freetown being turned aside and obliged to take the roads leading to the French Coast Settlements.

Since the downfall of the Spanish Colonial Empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Great Britain has been...\n\ntill lately, the only European Power of the first rank which has devoted its energies to the construction of an Empire outside the geographical limits of its own home. In the absence of rivals, the course has been comparatively clear; and it seems difficult for Governments to realise that all this has been changed during the last two decades. If we would maintain the Empire which has been handed down to us by the enterprise and enthusiasm of the last nine generations, it can only be done by a ready recognition of the fact that other nations around us are only too eager to circumvent our plans, and to take advantage of every slip and inaction on our part.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1893#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE BRITISH POSITION ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In continuation of a series of articles upon the British Colonies, which have been appearing lately in the Times, our contemporary contains the following communication upon the present situation in the West African Colonies:—\n\nBritish trading interests in West Africa have taken alarm at the position and influence which have been acquired by France, and dissatisfaction has been expressed with Lord Knutsford's reply to the deputation of merchants that waited upon him.

No doubt men of larger views should have been in their places promptly, and in sufficient numbers to prevent such a mishap, but if the practice of seizing petty party opportunities in a spirit of utter disregard of the consequences had always been in vogue as it is now the British Empire would never have been created.

It is well known that an important and profitable part of the trade of this country is transacted with the regions in question. Of late it has been shown that the French Government has come to the rear of certain of these possessions in a manner that threatens to render them practically valueless. The mere holding of the coast is no boon apart from the power of communication with the interior, and already the French have gained such diplomatic advantages as have enabled them to turn the natives against us in vital quarters. A policy has been going on quietly for years, and commercial men in this country have suddenly realised the unwelcome fact that an agreement had long years ago been made behind their backs practically giving away that of which they were in actual possession. The French dream has long been to stretch forth the hand of aggression straight from Algeria, across the desert to Lake Tchad, and thence down to the French Congo. In effect the realisation of this ideal would give to our neighbours about a third of the area of the African continent. A huge proportion of it would of course be valueless. Even France does not wish to utilise the Great Sahara in any other way than to run a railway through it. But this is actually proposed, and if the grand scheme of France were to be carried out Great Britain would be virtually robbed of every acre of African soil from Gibraltar to Cape Colony on the western side of the Dark Continent. The idea of coming down behind is one which had not somehow been anticipated. It has not been usual in African exploration.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

The question under discussion is one of those curious points which sometimes arise in treaties relating to countries of which maps can give only an approximately correct idea. For the past twenty-five years France has been gradually closing in upon Sierra Leone, whose sole trade is in the various products which reach the coast from the interior. This trade is now a valuable one, the exports amounting to something like £400,000 a year, and the imports, mostly from England, to a similar sum. In August 1889, a convention was come to between the two countries as to the spheres of influence in the ""Hinterland,"" and it was agreed that the boundaries of Sierra Leone should not extend beyond 11:40 of longitude West of Greenwich and 10 degrees of latitude. Near the borderline was the important native town of Fararma, situated almost at the source of the River Niger. It is here that the native caravans on their way to Sierra Leone from the interior have to cross the river, and it is consequently a place of great commercial importance. On the French maps Fararma is shown well within the French boundary; but accurate observation demonstrates that it is really within the British limits, and the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are anxious to retain this important entrepôt of trade in their own hands. It is the neck of the bottle through which the trade of the colony flows, and this is recognised by the French no less than by the English colonists. France is therefore doing her utmost to obtain such a modification of the Convention above referred to as will give her control over this trade centre. The bait held out to our Government is some concession in that no-man\'s-land, the region around Lake Chad. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are alarmed at the danger which threatens their trade, and have pointed out to Lord Salisbury and Lord Knutsford that Sierra Leone is of great strategical importance to the Empire, and that the cession of Fararma to France, by enabling the French to deflect the trade to their Senegal and Niger colonies, must result in the destruction of the commerce of Sierra Leone and in its eventually being absorbed into the French colonies, by which it is even now almost entirely hemmed in.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The aim of his discourse was to arouse English opinion to more vigorous efforts by exhibiting the riches of the field ready to reward them. He reminded his hearers that England once had a free hand, and did not profit by her opportunities. The Gambia is among the oldest English colonies. It commands the mouth of a navigable waterway, along which England's authority might have spread over the whole interior. From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding. Not much better things can be said of the settlement of Sierra Leone. Its confines might have been expanded to take in the Upper Niger, which has its sources not far from the Sierra Leone boundary. At one time it was practicable to conciliate the friendship of the Mahommedan chief, Samadu, who has been building up an empire inland. The chance was postponed, and now Samadu has placed his kingdom under the protection of France. The colony of Lagos is the sole plantation at which Mr. Johnston can glance without vexation. There, though the Government delays to move the front of the harbour, and though official supineness is answerable for the interposition of wedges of foreign territory between Lagos and the Gold Coast, the spirit of English enterprise is seen. Trade has advanced by leaps and bounds. The settlement in its first year, 1862-3, counted it as £329,479; and in 1887 it was £906,812.

Of the officials he also speaks in complimentary language. British West Africa has ceased to be a refuge for ruined spendthrifts, of whom their families rejoiced to rid themselves. West African Governors of the present type instruct the natives in the vegetable riches of their own land, and the acclimatisation of useful foreign plants, and they cultivate a fashion among their staffs of learning the native languages.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe.

It highlights broader economic hardships in West Africa, which spurred political reforms and the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa, but does not specifically link these to trade disruptions in the regions mentioned. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing how local wars and disturbances among natives led to below-average export levels in the Gambia and trade disruptions in British Sherbro' and Sierra Leone. These disturbances prompted merchants to advocate for diplomatic solutions, such as sending a special commissioner to negotiate peace, reflecting the British government's preference for diplomacy over military intervention. However, the articles also acknowledge other contributing factors, such as the abolition of the slave trade and economic competition, indicating a complex interplay of influences on trade.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances. When indigenous peoples took action to organize their own defence, they were frequently used as mercenaries in wars elsewhere, as in the case of some of the Gurunsi who fought in the ranks of the Zamberma, and the Samo (Sanan) who took part in the dynastic wars of Yatenga."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The Mombasa hinterland routes', 'content': 'It appears that in the latter part of the nineteenth century, Arab and Swahili traders were strongly in control of the Kamba trade route. 16 This was because, having pushed through the Maasai country using the Kilimanjaro route (at a time when Maasai power was heavily affected by wars and epidemics), the coastal traders had been able to gain control of the sources of ivory. At this time, trade in slaves (which had not been prominent under the Kamba) seems to have become more important. Kamba traditions picture this as the most disruptive period in their history: disruptive famine led to inter-lineage conflicts that were used by ambitious members of society to sell weaker ones to Arabs.$^{17}$ Kamba traditions, therefore, rightly indicate the relationship between the decline of trade in goods in which they themselves played a major part and the rise of the system of profiteering in persons in which the Arabs and Swahili traders played a prominent role.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

The consequent instability increased the number of people who were ready to follow enterprising leaders. In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another. In the 1860s the Arabs managed to have Mnwa Sele deposed and replaced by Mkasiwa, and Mnwa Sele's brother Simba left Unyanyembe to set up his kingdom among the Konongo to the south-west of Tabora.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward.

The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

These covered a large part of Tanzania and, on a smaller scale, western Kenya. Traditional rulers who were able to control the trade were also able to accumulate the imported goods with which to build up a large army and to expand administrative machinery. Weaker states were either raided for slaves or annexed to form larger entities. In these areas the effect was either constructive in that it enabled certain rulers to build up bigger kingdoms in areas previously supporting smaller states, or destructive in the sense that it encouraged rebellion, which in turn destroyed the unity of the states that existed. Despite this generalization, the effect of the long-distance trade was generally destructive. There is no need to detail here the evils of the trade in human beings. But even the value of the material base built on imported goods was deceptive. Most of these goods were luxury items: beads, bracelets and other ornaments. What was useful was cloth, but even this competed with local sources of production which were eventually destroyed. Worse still, the trade in luxury goods and the general violence caused by the need to raid other societies in order to maintain the trade, meant neglect of subsistence agriculture. It is unlikely that the new structure could have been maintained even if colonialism had not intervened. In fact few of the large states built up during this period survived intact to the 1890s.\nIn order to illustrate this general picture it will be necessary to look briefly at the three caravan-route regions. In discussing the Kamba, we noticed how even their control of trade declined when raiding for slaves became prominent. The Kamba were a non-centralized society. The long› distance trade probably encouraged an enlargement of scale of various traditional institutions, beginning with kinship, village age-group and defence organizations. But none of these became the basis for a centralized state structure.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 591, 'article_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'full_section_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '03-09-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'issue_date': '24_04_1865', 'content': 'If, however, prices do not soon fall to their original level, there is no doubt but that cotton will be cultivated successfully at the Gambia, though it is to be hoped not to the exclusion of the ground-nut.\n\nThe export of hides has not varied much in the ten years previous to 1864, and the value of wax exported remains much what it has been of late years.\n\nThe principal articles of import are (Return No. 2, Appendix) cotton goods, rice, and tobacco; a large proportion of the population being Mohammedan, the consumption of spirits is not as great as in the other settlements.

The latest news from the river is that Biram Ceasey has taken one more port, and is preparing to attack another. That will leave only three ports open for trade in 100 miles of river frontage in the Budiboo country, and those three ports are not safe—may be attacked any time. This war in Budiboo is a sad injury to the trade of Gambia, as it reduces the output of produce at least 8,000 to 9,000 tons, and closes a large market for English manufactures. Very small action on part of the Government would put an end to it, but they refuse on the score of the trouble and expense, and this with a surplus of £23,000 in hand. Now, how much would it cost to keep a sloop-of-war here one month that could land 200 men, a Gatling gun, and one small shell gun? Yet in that time or perhaps less, both Biram Ceasey in Budiboo, and Fody Cubbu in the Jolah country, who are ruining the trade, could be put down. Indeed, the natives themselves say, ""If the Government would only interfere, they would be compelled to make peace."" In fact war has so wasted these countries that both sides are worn out, and only continue the fight through pride. Surely the cost of a man-of-war for such a time would be well repaid by the preservation yearly to the commerce of this place of such a large amount of produce.

But they plead that in the present neglected state of the colony it would not be judicious to make the requisite preparatory arrangements—thus not only inflicting injury on the colony, but also, reflectively, of course, upon the industries of the mother country.\n\nIt has been authoritatively asserted that Her Majesty's Government cannot employ force for the establishment of peace or putting down outrages in countries beyond the jurisdiction of the Crown.\n\nBut inasmuch as the British Government not only claims, but exercises jurisdiction over the waters of the Gambia, by levying taxes on goods ascending and descending that river, it would seem only a matter of right that Her Majesty's subjects, recollecting that in England taxation and protection go together, should either receive, in this instance, protection from the colonial authorities, or that they should celebrate the demise of their authority and power by the removal of all duties and all official impediments and restrictions on the river.\n\nAppealed to by its members on this question, the Chamber can only in its turn make representations to the Colonial Office.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRADE IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The question of the drink traffic and King Ja Ja's troubles, which have been subjects of discussion in the House of Commons lately, ought to attract increased attention to the trade of West Africa.\n\nOur oldest settlement there is at the mouth of the Gambia river; but though the oldest, the total import and export trade amounts to only £380,000 a year. With the exception of the Senegal, the river is the finest on this part of the coast, but it is almost useless for trade purposes, because the country is in so disturbed a condition. Wax, hides, and ground nuts are the principal exports. The ground nuts are sent to Marseilles, where a substitute for olive oil is pressed from them. Rice, cotton, maize, and a kind of millet are also produced, but not in sufficient quantities for export. The charge on ordinary merchandise is 2 per cent. _ad valorem_.\n\nSierra Leone, with a coast line 200 miles long, has a trade of a different character, the produce of the palm, nuts and oil, hides, gum copal, ground nuts, ginger, and kola nuts being exported. The gum copal and the palm oil are for the most part shipped to Great Britain, and the hides to the United States.\n\nThe most promising place of all in this part of the world is Lagos, where the natives are eager to trade. The exports are palm oil and various oil seeds; but although the chances of business are excellent, British rule has failed to develop trade to anything like the extent that was anticipated. The reason is the isolation of the settlements, which were originally slave settlements. Fifty years ago slavery was abolished, and then, instead of making a radical change in the methods of government which the altered conditions required, no action was taken, and the machinery of government was merely adapted to the circumstances. The British Administration has made practically no effort to conciliate the tribes in the interior, or to remove the suspicions which the early history of the colonies had implanted in the minds of the natives. Custom-houses were set up, and, as the natives derive no benefit from the expenditure of the taxes in the colonies, they naturally did not like the new institutions. Then, again, the natives on the coast hate those in the interior, and British administrators invariably sided with the former. The three Ashantee wars were due to this cause. If efforts were made to conciliate the Mandingoes, the Foulahs, and other large tribes in the interior, the trade of these settlements would certainly not consist, as it does at the present time, almost exclusively of the produce of the fringe of land adjoining the sea. The Americans and Germans, particularly the latter, are looking after this trade. As usual, the Germans are picking up the language and the customs of the natives, and it is time our Government bestirred itself to conciliate people who might be valuable customers."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-07-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1888#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Intestine wars had broken out amongst the natives in the Mellicourie country, near Sierra Leone, and several European factories had been destroyed and plundered.

Hutton said that for years past the Manchester Chamber of Commerce had been in correspondence with the Colonial Office in reference to the West Coast of Africa, and had constantly called attention to the neglect of the authorities to attend to the interests of our trade, and to the responsibilities that ought to be undertaken in connexion with it. This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position.

He seems to consider that the chief Mahabah is performing a duty which the Government neglected to do, and for doing which it envies the man who is really performing very important public services, and preparing the way for the progressive civilization of the country. That man, Mahabah, he says, is not seeking his own interests only, but that of all British subjects. British merchants have been without any real, efficient protection in the river of late years, and Mahabah has made a vast improvement in this respect during the last 24 months. It is true, he proceeds, that, partly owing to the war, and partly to the famine that prevailed during the rainy season, there has been a great deficiency of produce, ""but it is far better to prepare the ground before sowing seed, than to sow it in unprepared soil."" The Pagsoos, in this river, are a people that do not work, but who go about plundering those who do work; pillaging the merchants and traders, and committing many other and great enormities. They are, in fact, a lazy, predatory, and degraded people. The late war between the British and Badiboo was caused by such deeds as are above alluded to. The British effected really nothing, but Mahabah has made an entire change. These people, before so troublesome, having been brought by him under subjection, are now learning to depend on their own labour for the means of support; so that British merchants, who previously scarcely dared to commission any traders in that part, have now been able to find employment as traders there for those who have been (so arbitrarily, as he contends) dismissed from the Government service.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

Moreover, they afford us the plea for proffering our intervention when they show a disposition to quarrel amongst themselves, and in some recent instances our interference has been attended with very good results.

There are various causes assigned for the depression in Sierra Leone. I may mention some of these. Stoppage of the slave traffic: A few years ago it was the practice of traders, called Banjuls, from Bathurst, to betake themselves to the riverine towns of the Protectorate, and purchase slaves brought from up-country, and take them back to Bathurst; and the money brought for this purpose was usually spent in Freetown. Again, traders from the Susu country and Futa Yallon used to drive cattle to Freetown, barter them there for trade guns, powder, and Manchester goods, proceed up country—preferably to those parts where slave raiding and tribal wars were going on—purchase the captives taken, and return with them to their own country. All this trade is now stopped, and I do not suppose any right-minded person can regret it when he considers the iniquities of the slave traffic. During my tour last year in the interior I released several parties of slaves consisting of men, women, and children, either shackled with chains or led along tied to one another with halters round their necks. Another cause of the depression has been attributed to the attitude assumed by the domestic slaves, who are not so subservient as formerly to their masters, who find it difficult to get them to gather the produce and send it to the markets. However, I have found that those masters who treat their slaves kindly do not lose them. Hundreds of slaves come every week to Freetown with trade canoes across from Bullom and the adjacent shores, and I have heard no complaints of their deserting their masters. A third cause assigned is the influx of Natives from the interior and the emigration of labourers. It is estimated that 6,000 labourers have proceeded to the Congo since the commencement of the year. This emigration may affect the producing power, but numbers of these labourers return with their wages, which they spend in the Colony; and those who come to Freetown and obtain work there convert their earnings into goods and return with them to their masters. The cessation of the raids and wars which supplied the slave traders, and the entire prohibition of the traffic, must revolutionise the system of trade, and probably accounts for some of the depression that has prevailed, which has been even more felt in French Guinea, as I am informed, than in the Colony of Sierra Leone.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""A Snubbed Colony—Dr. Gouldsbury's Expedition"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Well, his lordship sends us an answer through the Administrator here, which being summarized is, ""his lordship regrets that in your opinion trade should be in such a depressed state.""

Well, he takes the return of the revenue for the past couple of years and compares that with former years, and it looks well; but then importers and exporters had to pay duties each year whether they lost or not, hoping for the best; but really the past two years have been most disastrous.

This led to many of the Native chiefs, forming a combination, and issuing orders to their people not to sell palm kernels under 5s. a bushel. This resulted in a temporary cessation of the trade, but probably had a more injurious effect still in that it checked the harvesting of the nuts, which thus were lost. I do not think this depression can be attributable to any diminution in the produce of the country. The annual report for 1893 shows there was a net increase of £21,789 in the value of exports during that year; the chief exports being palm kernels, rubber, kola nuts, palm oil, ginger, rice, gum copal, pepper and benniseed. Last year the revenue reached the highest figures it has ever done, which shows that the produce has in no sense diminished; but I should say the chief cause of the low prices, and therefore depression, is that as there are now more traders engaged in commerce than formerly there is a keener competition and a far smaller margin of profit. A botanic station is being started at Freetown, and preparations made to hold an agricultural show next January, which I hope will be an annual one.\n\nAmongst the principal objects is the encouragement of the cultivation of coffee, cocoa, and kola nuts. Already the prospect of the agricultural shows has given a spurt to these industries, and coffee especially is being largely planted. The country rice should be introduced to the markets at home. I understand there is a prejudice against it owing to its brown appearance; this is due to the fact that small portions of the husk are left adhering to the grain; this imperfection is in appearance only—the particles of husk give a very sweet flavour to the rice, and make it rich and nourishing. If once the public could get over their prejudice against it they would buy it readily. The cultivation of the Kola Nut is an industry that should be fostered. There is an increasing demand for it all over the world. In the German army a preparation of the nut forms a reserve ration for active service. I believe this industry will, in the future, yield larger returns than coffee or cocoa. An examination of the causes of trade depression is of importance, for after all the question of the introduction of a railway into a country must be determined by the prospects of its trade.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
