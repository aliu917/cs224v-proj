With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers. The family was the basic unit of production. It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock. First, it did not involve any fundamental technological innovation. Second, many of these crops or similar ones had been grown and processed long before the colonial era.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded. In particular it seems that direct European involvement was counterproductive, as in the failed efforts at agricultural colonization in Waalo between 1819 and 1831,$^{21}$ and in the various efforts in Senegal, the southern Gold Coast, and Nigeria later on.$^{22}$ It was not that European personnel began to loom larger on the African scene; rather, the important change was that Europeans were largely displacing African merchants from The shift from the slave trade to palm oil strengthened the hand of private as against royal merchants (R. Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power. Thus, the diversification of the items of trade without : substantial modification of the pattern of trade did not produce the economic and social revolution expected, at least not in the first half of the', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life. Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area. This production at first co-existed with the slave trade,$^{14}$ and later flourished on its own, until the boom came to an end in 1861, and finally declined at the end of the century.$^{15}$ The palm-oil trade similarly expanded in the Gold He finds the relevant consideration to be Europe's need of raw materials and points out the 'extraordinary demands on production' involved in the new amounts of palm oil, timber, and rubber exported.

Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930. Cotton, palm oil, coffee, groundnuts and cocoa illustrate such characteristics in the parts of the continent with which they are respectively associated.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""The coast had always exported palm oil, but in minute quantities. Imports into Britain rose from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21 000 tonnes in 1844, levelled off for ten years or so, and then doubled by 1870. France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels', 'content': ""The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend.

Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""The role of the European commercial firms has been assessed by many scholars, most of whom agree on the significance of connecting Africa with markets in Western Europe and the Americas.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""The great transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world did not occur with the late nineteenth-century partition by European powers. Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.742, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': 'who went into the interior and shipped them overseas, and vice-versa. 23 New export-oriented production necessarily implied new imports.

Nomadic groups such as the Ahaggar and Kel-Ewey Tuareg, the Tubu, and the Zuwaya of the central Sahara (a Beduin group not to be confused with zawiya clerical lineages in Mauritania) traded small quantities of slaves and other products on their own account, but they could not match the scale of sedentary merchants from the northern oases, who had financial backing from middlemen in Mediterranean ports and ultimately from Europe, especially when prices and conditions on the routes were favour¬ able. Consequently the main role of camel nomads was to provide transport animals, guides, and military escorts for caravans, and they also ran freight delivery services for merchants who were unable to or preferred not to accompany caravans.21 Most groups of Saharan nomads had a major stake in the trade that passed through their territory: Regibat on the route to western Morocco; Ait Khabbash (a segment of the Ait Atta) on the Tafilälet-Tüwät road; Chaamba on the routes north of Tüwat; Tuareg on the Tripoli-Kano route; Tubu on the Borno-Fezzän road; Mujabra and Zuwaya for traffic between Benghazi and Wadai; KabäbTsh on the Darb al-Arbaln (forty-day road) between Därfür and the lower Nile.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': '1 New trends in the Maghrib: Algeria, Tunisia and Libya', 'section_title': 'The trans-Saharan trade', 'content': 'The trans-Saharan trade was still flourishing at the beginning of the nineteenth century, both in the west (from Timbuktu to Tafilälet and from Goulimime to Taodeni) and in the centre (from Tunis and Tripoli to Ghadämes), and Sudanese exports still consisted ofslaves and gold. Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards. In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850. In 1895 trade by way of the TripoliBorno route suffered from the operations conducted by Rabeh, and the disruptions caused mainly by the French conquests in West Africa had their repercussions.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: North Africa', 'section_title': 'Part I: the economy of Tunisia, Algeria and MorOCCO, I919-35 A.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

It is believed to branch off from the Niger, but the natives are so jealous of Europeans proceeding any distance into the interior, that it has never been explored, and nothing is really known of it beyond a few miles from its mouth. It is a good wide river where it falls into the sea, so that probably, if it is a branch of the Niger, it receives in its way to join the sea some streams. The repugnance the natives entertain to white men exploring their country does not issue from any dislike to the white men as such, but to a belief that if once the country is explored, the white men will flock to the interior, get at the markets, and so put an end to the trade of the middlemen, who at present purchase the oil up-country and bring it to the coast, making a handsome profit out of the transaction. There are about eight trading houses here, all of them English, and trade appears to be very brisk. Palm oil and kernels are, of course, the chief exports. The houses of the traders are situated together close to the mouth of the river, and they are picturesque in the extreme, constructed, of course, of wood, with roofs of corrugated iron, each house having a pier, godowns, and store-rooms in close proximity, so that the whole looks exactly like a miniature colony. Most of the traders have constructed tiny gardens in front of their residences, wherein they grow some of the choicest of the tropical plants intermingled with English roses, which form an attractive oasis in the dense masses of jungle and mangrove swamps with which each bank of the river is overgrown. The native town, at which the king resides, is distant some four miles up the river, and covers a considerable amount of space. Ja Ja has gone in heavily for the ""resources of civilization."" He has had a large banqueting hall built, decorated and furnished in the most tawdry fashion: here a huge banquet is spread every day for such of the chiefs and their retainers as may care to partake of it, and here also the king entertains any white men who may visit his capital, and who are invited in due course to partake of ""chop,"" the native designation for a meal of any kind. To a person of English tastes, the viands, though plentiful in quantity, are not inviting: mysterious and unwholesome-looking dishes of native manufacture, enormous dishes of fish and goat stored in filthy-looking grease, and flavoured with the inevitable palm wine, do not have an invigorating effect on the stomach. Palm oil wine, a somewhat insipid beverage, with a taste in some measure approximating to home-made ginger beer, appears to be the chief native drink. The king does not, however, stint his guests to the wine of the country. Every description of European liquor is at their disposal. Ja Ja himself does not drink intoxicating fluids. ""They make man fool"" is his laconic description of their effect; and as the king is neither a fool nor has he any wish to become one, he is probably right to abstain from them. The house is neither particularly clean nor particularly dirty. Both the king and the principal chiefs have European built houses, and live more or less in European style. Ja Ja is a despotic monarch, and rules his people with a rod of iron, after a somewhat rough-and-ready fashion. A short time since he was disturbed in his slumbers one afternoon by a noisy disturbance which was taking place in close proximity to the royal palace between the retainers of two of his chiefs. The king got up, took down a Winchester repeating rifle, and shot dead with his own hands two of the obstreperous party, pour encourager les autres. There is no standing army, but nearly all the able-bodied men are trained to arms, and the king has three Gatling guns and some Armstrong field pieces, of which he is exceedingly proud. He is frequently engaged in war with neighbouring kings, and, as a rule, comes off the victor on these occasions. The prisoners taken in battle are killed and eaten. This is the only occasion upon which human flesh is indulged in. This, however, is not a custom incidental to Ja Ja alone, but appears to be the recognized method of warfare among the kings in this part of the world. The most powerful personage in the kingdom after the king is his ""prime minister,"" a negress rejoicing in the name of Emma Johnson, who, born a Kentucky slave, afterwards migrated to Liberia, and eventually, after a somewhat chequered career, arrived at Ja Ja\'s kingdom, where, being a shrewd woman, nimble at her pen, she has acquired an extraordinary amount of power, and has more influence over the king than any one else. [In our last number we directed our readers\' attention to some of the vagaries of this lady.] The greater portion of the income of both kings and chiefs is derived from the sale of palm oil, which they obtain up-country and dispose of to the English traders. Besides this, Ja Ja receives a duty of one per cent. on all oil exported from the river, and some other duties besides; so that his income is computed to be not less than £10,000 a year, a prodigious sum for a petty African king. Ja Ja has 200 wives. His eldest son and heir to the throne is being educated at a school in Liverpool, where he has been for a considerable time past, so that when he succeeds his father he will utilize his English education for the advancement of his country, and not as some other of those young native princes who were educated at home, and who have become more barbarous, blood-thirsty, and cruel to Europeans when they return to their native country, and throw over the burdensome restraints of civilization. Now that Ja Ja\'s country has been placed under English protection, it is to be hoped some of the cruelties and atrocities which, it is much to be feared, are not of infrequent occurrence, will be put a stop to. Ja Ja is a shrewd monarch, and as he is all-powerful and has no rivals, it only requires a little judicious pressure to induce him to govern his kingdom on somewhat less rough-and-ready principles than is now the case. The king has been of late endeavouring to ship palm oil to England on his own account, by which he can get about double the price he does out here. Up to the present, however, the traders have been too much for him in this respect, and the steamship companies, induced by them, will not take it on freight. The king, however, is not likely to be long baulked in his project: he can always bring a little gentle pressure to bear on the traders by stopping the oil supply. On the whole, Ja Ja himself, his capital, and his country, are interesting in the extreme. There is capital shooting here—elephants, crocodiles, hippopotami, and leopards, within easy reach too, so that a lover of sport finds his hands full.—*Times of India.*'}, {'id': 6278, 'article_title': 'Produce Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Produce Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1892#article-14', 'issue_date': '05_12_1892', 'content': ""## LIVERPOOL, FRIDAY, NOV. 25.\n\n**SUGAR.**—A moderate amount of business has been done, without any material change to notice in prices, the tone at the close being quiet.\n\n**COFFEE.**—Business is restricted by the smallness of supplies, and the sales reported are at hardening rates. 70 bags bold berry African at 65s., and 50 bags elephant berry at 85s., in store; and, to arrive, 400 bags African bold berry at 65s. to 65s. 6d. per cwt, tel quel, ex quay, in transit.\n\n**COCOA.**—Low kinds continue scarce, but there is now rather more of the better sorts offering, which, however, meet with little attention. 59 bags African at 57s. 6d. to 62s. 6d. per cwt.\n\n**GINGER.**—25 bags African at 31s. per cwt.\n\n**CALABAR BEANS.**—50 bags at 1s. 2d. per lb.\n\n**COCHINEAL.**—Small sales of rosy black at 1s. 1d. per lb.\n\n**INDIA-RUBBER.**—A fair amount of business has been done in Para during the week, and the tone of the market has been very firm; sales of fine quality of recent import have been made at 2s. 9¾d., both on the spot and for forward delivery, and fine of older import at 2s. 10¼d. per lb.

For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.751, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Rubber, palm kernels, palm oil, and benni seed (an oil-producing substance) constitute the bulk of the exports of Sierra Leone. The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour. It is stated that in the 17th century the export of gold from Elmina reached as much as three millions sterling in one year.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632.

It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

That they are instruments in the world's advancement, is undeniable. We alluded last month to the impulse given to the search for available fibre, consequent upon the failure of the cotton supply from America, and of the influence fibre might exercise in the great work of African industrial regeneration. It is scarcely necessary to say here that we believe in that regeneration. And feeble as the evidences of its approach may seem to the world at large, we think we see in them a strength that nothing can long impede or overcome. Yes, Africa must emerge from her Pagan superstition, her wars and atrocities, her industrial apathy and inertia. Looking at her in relation with the rest of the world some ten years since, the prospect was gloomy enough; the day of her emerging seemed indefinitely postponed. This was only because we could not see what was in the womb of time. Those ten years, a brief space in the world's history, have been mighty in the agencies which they have organised for African advancement. The inscrutable mind and Almighty hand of Divine Providence have been at work among the nations for the good of Africa!

Palm oil has become the great staple of Western Africa. Taking into account the difficulty of access to the interior, and the manners and habits of the people, it must be admitted that the trade in this useful article has had an extraordinary development. Palm oil was precisely such an article as the barbarous inhabitants of a tropical climate needed to possess in the infancy of their commerce. The tree which produces the palm-oil nut is the most valuable of all trees to the native African. It grows spontaneously over large tracts of country. It furnishes him with oil, wine, vinegar, thatch, fibre, and fuel.

In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall.

Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
35,Colonial powers integrated African economies into global trade networks by focusing on specific regions and commodities.,"The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that colonial powers integrated African economies into global trade networks by focusing on specific regions and commodities. The textbook highlights how colonial powers established trading centers and routes, such as those in Central Africa and along the Indian Ocean, to facilitate the trade of commodities like ivory, slaves, and cash crops. It describes the transformation of African economies through the introduction of new trading commodities and the establishment of monocrop economies, which were highly sensitive to international trade conditions. This integration was often exploitative, with colonial powers prioritizing regions already involved in pre-colonial trade, such as the coastal areas of West and East Africa, and focusing on commodities in demand in Europe and the Americas. European commercial firms played a significant role in expanding the cash sector and connecting Africa with Western markets, further supporting the claim. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the significant role of palm oil and palm kernels as staple exports from West Africa, particularly from regions like the Oil Rivers, Lagos, and the Bight of Benin, indicating a focus on specific regions and products. The historical shift from the slave trade to legitimate commerce, such as palm oil, facilitated by British merchants, aligns with the claim of integrating African economies into global trade networks. The development of infrastructure, such as steamers and railways, to support trade, further supports the claim. However, both sources also note the negative consequences and complexities of this integration, such as economic dependency, social inequality, ecological destruction, and changes in trade practices, like the shift from barter to silver currency.

The Ovimbundu highlands were linked to the coast by another route that led to Caconda and Benguela.

This production at first co-existed with the slave trade,$^{14}$ and later flourished on its own, until the boom came to an end in 1861, and finally declined at the end of the century.$^{15}$ The palm-oil trade similarly expanded in the Gold He finds the relevant consideration to be Europe's need of raw materials and points out the 'extraordinary demands on production' involved in the new amounts of palm oil, timber, and rubber exported.

Whereas most slaves had probably been obtained through legal commerce in the preceding period, raiding and conquest replaced it as the dominant mode of acquisition. According to Chikunda traditions; for example, in the earlier phase of the slave trade they were able to purchase Nsenga, Chewa and Tonga slaves, many of whom were originally criminals, social outcasts or strangers. Subsequently, however, they used coercive tactics to satisfy the coastal demand. 34 Similarly, Yao itinerant traders initially exploited their access to cheap cloth and iron hoes to achieve a pre-eminent commercial position, but external pressures during the second half of the century motivated them to exert military pressure in the Shire valley in order to ensure their economic hegemony.$^{35}$ Makua participation in the slave trade underwent a parallel transformation while force had always been a component of the Arab-Swahili strategy. 36 To ensure a constant supply of captives and ivory, a number of trading groups carved out sizeable conquest states. Although differing in detail, these polities shared common characteristics that shaped their historical development. All these alien overlords relied heavily on European weapons to impose their hegemony and maintain their pre-eminence. These soph› isticated weapons were acquired in exchange for captives in an updated version of the gun-slave cycle. Once firmly entrenched, the alien ruling classes expanded the frontiers of their empire; while the amount of force varied, coercion was the dominant mechanism of incorporation. The new acquisitions provided additional sources of slaves and ivory, which were used to increase the size of their arsenals, thereby enabling further expan› sion.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Delayed incorporation of eastern Africa', 'content': 'The eastern coast of Africa was also still relatively outside the capitalist world-economy. Its primary external links had been across the Indian Ocean. Still, India and to a lesser extent south-western Asia were now themselves being incorporated into the capitalist world-economy. The slave trade expanded in this region in the nineteenth century, however, precisely because eastern Africa was still an external arena. Nonetheless, it served there, as it had in west-central Africa, as a dynamic disruptive and recon› structing force. The island of Zanzibar was incorporated into the world- economy via its dominant role in the world market for cloves by the mid-nineteenth century, which involved the establishment of a plantation system.$^{32}$ Sugar plantations were created on Mauritius, and Madagascar developed rice and beef production for export to Mauritius.$^{33}$ It was, however, the Scramble for Africa which later spilled over into eastern Africa and precipitated the kind of change of which it was the result elsewhere in Africa.\nThe transformation of production structures could not have occurred in isolation from a transformation of the political structures that facilitated the economic changes and sought to legitimize them.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Unprecedented commercial penetration from the East African coast during the nineteenth century resulted in the incorporation of most of Central Africa into the capitalist world economy. As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony. The value of the rubber exported is about £6,000 annually.

The protectorate, announced at Bonny, in December last, by Admiral Sir Walter Hunt Grubb, extends from the right bank of Benin river to the Rio del Rey, thus including Brass, New and Old Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, and other important trading stations.\n\nTwo series of considerations, the internal and external, have combined to render action imperative, and a retrospective view may not be uninstructive. Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo. He collected his scattered family, dependants, and slaves, and made his escape to the Opobo river.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The trade between this country and West Africa is capable of almost infinite development. It is now announced that the British Government will recommend Parliament to grant a subsidy to a contractor who is prepared to lay and work a cable between St. Vincent and the chief places on the West Coast. We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Parcel Post with the Oil Rivers Protectorate', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""It is evident that in a trade which has its foundation on the barter system the value and quantity of the imports must vary directly with the exports. There is of late years a growing tendency on the part of the native, even in the remote interior, to employ silver currency for his transactions in place of direct barter or the cumbrous method of transporting vast quantities of cowrie shells from market to market. Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods.

The demand for kola nuts was reported to be at all times considerable in Brazil, but in view of the slowness of the passage and the difficulty of keeping them in marketable condition, the value has at no time during the past six years exceeded £3,563, while in 1877 it sank as low as £304. Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE UNITED STATES AND THE CONGO.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'NEW YORK, Jan. 10.\n\nThe New York Chamber of Commerce has adopted a resolution requesting President Arthur to appoint a commission to confer with the African International Association, of which the King of the Belgians is the President, for the purpose of securing for other countries free commerce on the Congo river, which is at present monopolised by the Portuguese.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following communication has been sent to us.

The textbook highlights the expansion of trade in ivory and slaves, drawing East Africa into a broader trading network, and notes a sevenfold increase in goods through Angolan ports between 1844 and 1881, alongside a tenfold increase in cash turnover at the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino between 1865 and 1876.

The integration of Central Africa into the capitalist world economy, with increased exports of ivory and slaves, further supports the claim, though it also highlights negative impacts like the underdevelopment of local industries and resource exploitation. Complementing this, The African Times articles report rising customs duties, such as increased receipts at Rufisque and Casamanca, and substantial customs revenue in various regions, indicating heightened trade activity. The articles provide data on exports and imports, with exports rising from £741,558 in 1852 to £1,559,450 in 1861, and note the development of local commerce through new agricultural initiatives and expanded trade routes. The growth in exports of palm oil, palm kernels, and rubber, along with the establishment of commercial infrastructure, aligns with the claim of economic growth.

The roots for the growth of a commercial empire penetrating the interior of East Africa were also laid in the early part of the nineteenth century. By the 1840s the trade in ivory and slaves was expanding rapidly and was drawing the interior into the trading network already established on the coast.\nThere is a tendency to consider ivory and slaves as interconnected commodities of trade since in most cases they came from the same region and also since slaves could be employed to carry ivory. But the importance of this superficial inter-relationship has been exaggerated. Clearly, for long- distance trade, both ivory and slaves had to be exchanged for other bulky commodities, such as cloth, wire and beads which also had to be transported.\nA much more important inter-relationship centres on the fact that both commodities were involved in an international commercial system that was drawing East Africa into a subordinate role, and in turn influencing the development of trade in East Africa in the period prior to the establishment of colonialism.

Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy.

Some of them were large and powerful while others were small and weak. But all of them had participated in a regional trade network whose routes connected most of the major capitals. It was into this regional trade network that the inter› national trade from the East African coast was to be absorbed. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the most powerful of these kingdoms were probably Buganda, Bunyoro and Burundi. But there were many others less powerful, including Busoga, Toro, the Ankole states (Nkore, Buhweju and Bunyaruguru),$^{28}$ Karagwe, the Buhaya states and Buzinza.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels', 'content': ""The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

We begin to observe that, in the nineteenth century, the predominant 'business of the state' was the aggregation of production and exchange, whether this process of accumulation was evolv› ing within the framework of the old domain or whether evolving beyond the effective administrative boundaries of the state. The control of pro› duction and exchange was very much at issue as states such as Rwanda, Buganda, Burundi, and Bunyoro enlarged their domains and expanded their range of influence in the nineteenth century.\nEarlier, note was made of Mawanda's programme of expansion into Kyaggwe. This eighteenth-century move was directed at productive regions lying beyond the control of the Buganda kingdom. Kyaggwe held barkcloth, iron ore and iron-working artisans, and it held access to the pro› ductive islands of the northern Lake Victoria area. The Buvuma Islands, offshore from Kyaggwe, were well linked into the trading networks of the eastern Lake Victoria area. The aggregation of productive forces, materials, skills, labour, and access to, or control over, the nodes of regional trade circuits were among the main items of business of the precolonial Lakes Plateau state.\nExtractions from routinely administered areas and extractions from outside the domain brought wealth into the courts and fed the governing regime. In the nineteenth century, extractions of tribute, with the opposed resistance to the extractions of the state, linked regions of production and regions of consumption in a broad network of 'conflict-driven' relations, while overlaying and affecting - and often deforming - the precolonial market networks that spanned the Lakes Plateau region. The interplay of state extraction and the resistance of producers and producing areas to coercion by the tribute-taking state is most apparent, in the nineteenth century, in the domain of food production, food exchange, and food consumption. Paradoxically, within this region of apparent, and much noted, abundance, the control of supplies of food appears to have moved to the centre of relations among states and relations between the state and producers. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1800-45', 'section_title': 'Omani international trade', 'content': ""Said is credited with having set in motion a series of economic and commercial policies that not only turned Zanzibar into the most important commercial emporium on the East African coast - importing manufactured goods from India, Europe and the USA, and exporting cloves, ivory, slaves, rhinoceros horns, gum copal and other goods - but also, inevitably, with tying East Africa's economy to the chariot wheel of the Western capitalist system, which enriched the Asian, European and American merchants at the expense of the indigenous East African societies, thus leading to their underdevelopment.\nUnder this merchant capitalist system, the human and material resources of East African societies were exploited through the unequal exchange that became entrenched between the parasitic foreign merchants based in Zanzibar on the one hand, and the coastal and hinterland peoples on the other.\nThe very sizeable profits obtained were expatriated to Europe, the USA and India and hardly ever invested in the physical or technological development of East Africa.

These covered a large part of Tanzania and, on a smaller scale, western Kenya. Traditional rulers who were able to control the trade were also able to accumulate the imported goods with which to build up a large army and to expand administrative machinery. Weaker states were either raided for slaves or annexed to form larger entities. In these areas the effect was either constructive in that it enabled certain rulers to build up bigger kingdoms in areas previously supporting smaller states, or destructive in the sense that it encouraged rebellion, which in turn destroyed the unity of the states that existed. Despite this generalization, the effect of the long-distance trade was generally destructive. There is no need to detail here the evils of the trade in human beings. But even the value of the material base built on imported goods was deceptive. Most of these goods were luxury items: beads, bracelets and other ornaments. What was useful was cloth, but even this competed with local sources of production which were eventually destroyed. Worse still, the trade in luxury goods and the general violence caused by the need to raid other societies in order to maintain the trade, meant neglect of subsistence agriculture. It is unlikely that the new structure could have been maintained even if colonialism had not intervened. In fact few of the large states built up during this period survived intact to the 1890s.\nIn order to illustrate this general picture it will be necessary to look briefly at the three caravan-route regions. In discussing the Kamba, we noticed how even their control of trade declined when raiding for slaves became prominent. The Kamba were a non-centralized society. The long› distance trade probably encouraged an enlargement of scale of various traditional institutions, beginning with kinship, village age-group and defence organizations.

Larger states could raid smaller ones, but all of them raided the neighbouring noncentralized communities, who suffered the most. The exception of Rwanda and Burundi (already mentioned) shows that it was possible to form an alternative strategy in dealing with this penetration of trade. Their strength came not from acquisition of guns but from their ability to maintain stability and unity in the densely populated mountain environment. Their extensive wars and raids during the period enabled them to accumulate wealth in a situation in which ivory and captives were irrelevant.\nThe second region we have deliberately omitted in this section is southern Tanzania.

The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves.

Between the coast and the Sahel there were intermediate savanna regions that supplied slaves and livestock, including donkeys for trade and horses for war and for princely courts, but also cereals and gold.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Unprecedented commercial penetration from the East African coast during the nineteenth century resulted in the incorporation of most of Central Africa into the capitalist world economy. As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks. On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Peoples and states of the Great Lakes region', 'section_title': 'Coercion, violence and the market', 'content': 'The effects of resistance to the almost insatiable demands of the larger states in the Lakes region in the nineteenth century included the decline of productivity in nearby tributary areas and the consequent shift back to the courts of some of the costs of surplus production of foodstuffs - since more elaborate means had to be evolved to maintain the high levels of tribute from beyond the regular producing areas within the existing domains. Resistance, of course, raised the levels of violence in the wider region and resistance appears to have destabilized long-operating trade and market routines organized around and through Lakes Victoria, Kyoga, Lutanzige and Kivu, along with the salt lakes of south-western presentday Uganda, which had generated surpluses and had organized exchanges over a very long period.$^{14}$ We can draw a simple portrait of the region in the nineteenth century that highlights the much increased competition between two systems of regional exchange, one based on military force and political coercion, the other based on the market. In the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the Great Lakes region experienced the refinement of the system of coercion rather more than, and at the expense of, the system of marketing.

Although the data are fragmentary, it is clear that throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries an international network built upon localized trading provided commodities for the Indian Ocean ports dominated by Indian and Muslim merchant capital. Among the most important were ivory from the Luangwa valley and adjacent Undi territory, gold from the mines in the kingdoms of Manica and Changamire and just north of Tete, and copper from the Kafue region.$^{15}$ The scale of this trade seems to have been relatively small and somewhat irregular until the last two decades of the eighteenth century. The eastward thrust of the Lunda of Kazembe and their commercial alliance with the Bisa, the intensified activities of Yao merchants from the coast, and the commercial expansion of the Chikunda traders from the Zambezi prazos dramatically increased the level of exports to the Indian Ocean entrepôts. All three groups acquired substantial quantities of ivory and slaves for the world market, setting the stage for the progressive incorporation into the larger world economy, which was based almost entirely on the exchange of these two commodities for European manu› factured goods. 16 Transformation in the political and economic systems often generated parallel changes in the social and ethnic composition of Central African societies. The immigration of alien Shona- and Lunda-related peoples resulted in widespread intermarriage and even the emergence of entirely new ethnic groups, such as the Sena, Zambezi Tonga, and Goba.$^{17}$ The immigrants generally succeeded in imposing their core institutions and values upon the local population. The spread of the Lunda social mech› anism of perpetual kinship and positional succession throughout much of the region north of the Zambezi, for example, altered the basic structure of kinship and carried profound implications for the transmission of king› ship.$^{18}$ Of similar significance was the spread of the Shona Mwari cult and the supporting system of national ancestor spirits (mhondoró) throughout the southern tier of the Zambezi. The simultaneous introduction of the Shona language and symbol system in conjunction with the spread of Mwari must have fundamentally altered the cosmology of the indigenous inhabitants.$^{19}$ Culture change, however, was not unidirectional.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""The traditional compartmentalization between largely non-com› mercialized agricultural production and the long-distance trade in nonagricultural (luxury) products remained the rule even in those cases where there were small European agricultural settler communities, such as the prazeros in the Zambezi valley or the Boers on the Cape coast.\nThe one zone in which the economic situation was somewhat different was those parts of West and Central Africa where communities had begun to participate in the slave trade. The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

This led to many of the Native chiefs, forming a combination, and issuing orders to their people not to sell palm kernels under 5s. a bushel. This resulted in a temporary cessation of the trade, but probably had a more injurious effect still in that it checked the harvesting of the nuts, which thus were lost. I do not think this depression can be attributable to any diminution in the produce of the country. The annual report for 1893 shows there was a net increase of £21,789 in the value of exports during that year; the chief exports being palm kernels, rubber, kola nuts, palm oil, ginger, rice, gum copal, pepper and benniseed. Last year the revenue reached the highest figures it has ever done, which shows that the produce has in no sense diminished; but I should say the chief cause of the low prices, and therefore depression, is that as there are now more traders engaged in commerce than formerly there is a keener competition and a far smaller margin of profit. A botanic station is being started at Freetown, and preparations made to hold an agricultural show next January, which I hope will be an annual one.\n\nAmongst the principal objects is the encouragement of the cultivation of coffee, cocoa, and kola nuts. Already the prospect of the agricultural shows has given a spurt to these industries, and coffee especially is being largely planted. The country rice should be introduced to the markets at home. I understand there is a prejudice against it owing to its brown appearance; this is due to the fact that small portions of the husk are left adhering to the grain; this imperfection is in appearance only—the particles of husk give a very sweet flavour to the rice, and make it rich and nourishing. If once the public could get over their prejudice against it they would buy it readily. The cultivation of the Kola Nut is an industry that should be fostered. There is an increasing demand for it all over the world. In the German army a preparation of the nut forms a reserve ration for active service. I believe this industry will, in the future, yield larger returns than coffee or cocoa. An examination of the causes of trade depression is of importance, for after all the question of the introduction of a railway into a country must be determined by the prospects of its trade.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Colony of Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': '| Year | United Kingdom | Colonies | Foreign | Total |\n|------|----------------|----------|---------|-------|\n| 1887 | £247,764       | £1,933   | £58,351 | £308,038 |\n| 1888 | 190,529        | 1,211    | 58,407  | 250,147 |\n| 1889 | 210,800        | 1,110    | 65,871  | 277,781 |\n| 1890 | 295,012        | 1,627    | 93,269  | 389,908 |\n| 1891 | 345,031        | 2,145    | 106,202 | 453,378 |\n\nOf the imports in 1891 that entered for home consumption was £298,137, merchandise warehoused amounted to £146,553, and £8,688 worth of goods was transhipped.

The export of spirits in 1888 was 652,130 cwts., against 314,120 cwts. in 1878; the exports of the other principal articles for the two years were as follows: Rice, 90,778 cwts. in 1888 and 5,053 in 1878; beer, 16,479 and 2,919 cwts.; gunpowder, 86,320 and 10,844 cwts.; iron ware, 20,478 and 4,559 cwts.; tobacco, 12,048 and 2,784 cwts.; cotton goods, 11,053 and 3,110 cwts.

Lagos trade is subject to fluctuations, among other reasons, owing to the eccentric conduct of the middlemen from the interior, whose arbitrary demands and exactions have from time to time blocked the routes upon which the trade of the Colony depends.**\n\n""It is evident that in a trade which has its foundation on the barter system the value and quantity of the imports must vary directly with the exports. There is of late years a growing tendency on the part of the native, even in the remote interior, to employ silver currency for his transactions in place of direct barter or the cumbrous method of transporting vast quantities of cowrie shells from market to market. Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods. The attention of the natives has been directed lately to the importance of developing minor industries. Among these may be mentioned the cultivation of cocoa and coffee, which has been taken up both by the natives and, in one\n\nFor instance, on a large scale, by European enterprise. Even more importance is now attached to cotton, which is cultivated in large quantities in the interior of Yoruba for home manufacture. During the current year one of the obstructing tribes who prevented direct communication with the ""hinterland"" has been forced to open its roads, and it is to be hoped that the shipments of cotton, which amounted to 379,300lb., of a value at the port of shipment of £4,825 6s. 10d., during the past year, will in 1893 be very largely increased.

The staff consists of one chief clerk, one statistical officer, and thirty-two officers arranged into classes. Customs stations have been established at Old Calabar, Opobo, Bonny, Brass, Benin, and Warri. The adoption of special measures for the collection of duties, &c., have considerably lessened the primary difficulties in the way of establishing a recognised system both at Old Calabar and the other rivers.\n\nThe Returns will assist much in forming a correct estimate of the trade carried on in these rivers, taking into account the fact that prior to August 1 there was no Custom Houses or any means of obtaining authentic information of the business carried on in the Protectorate.\n\nThe imports into the Protectorate comprise nearly every variety of European manufacture. British trade is, of course, considerable, and susceptible of marked development. From the results of the first five months I estimated the annual value of imports at £709,269. The returns now presented show an increase of £39,154, the total value for the year being £748,423 12s. 8d. The total duty collected for the year amounted to £87,696 2s. 4d. The actual duty, after deducting the rebates on dutiable articles paid to Kroo boys, overcharges refunded, &c., as shown in the schedule, is £83,779 6s. 10d. Beside the amount of £2,093 10s. refunded at Old Calabar on goods imported by the steamship Coomassie. A quantity of cargo by the same vessel was declared ""free"" at other ports, on which no duty was collected. The duty recoverable thereon was £1,498 16s. It must be taken into consideration that duty on spirits assessed upon the old wine gallon from August 1 to December 31, 1891, was collected on the Imperial gallon from January 1, 1892. The total quantity imported under the latter arrangement was 544,494 gallons. Duty amounting to £5,444 19s. was consequently lost. It is not surprising, therefore, that with the increase in the value of imports, the duty fell in proportion to the first five months. There were goods with a duty of £8,897 18s. 2d. in Bond on July 31, 1892.\n\nThe articles enumerated in the returns of imports are mainly intended for the native markets, and consumed almost exclusively by them.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1893#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Unfortunately for us perhaps there does not exist that co-operation which might tend to open up some of these districts, nor the capital necessary for doing so, in the Settlement itself; commerce therefore kept within a circumscribed area and every day increased by new establishments has arrived at a stage which may safely be described as a perfect commercial deadlock. Whether or not it has been wise for so many to enter into trade, is a question which to-day it would be useless to discuss; since the evil, if evil it is, already exists and cannot be undone; to find outlets for the superabundant commercial population is therefore the only remedy that presents itself.

Its numerous rivers have provided sufficient room for all, and its position as regards the interior has rendered it a sort of commercial El Dorado to the mercantile world.

Beyond the Gallinas Country there lies that hitherto unknown tract of country, but lately penetrated by His Excellency Sir Samuel Rowe, known as the Barrie Country; seldom, if ever, before visited by Europeans and hardly ever by Sierre Leone traders. The position of its principal town Dandazuma as a trading centre renders it of such importance to the commercial community that it cannot but be said to be peculiarly fortunate that it has been opened to commerce in these trying times. From it there are roads to the Tuonchia country rich in palm kernels and palm oil, the Wenday and Gowrah and other districts beyond as yet uninvaded by traders; it is within easy access of both Yonnie and Mesmah in the Kittam and is not very distant from Sulymah. Rich in produce which its people would gladly exchange for European products it is undoubtedly one of the finest markets which has for some time presented itself, and which, it is to be hoped, now that peace has been restored to the district and it has been opened to the traders of all nationalities, will not long remain undeveloped. It is said that not far inland of it, is a district known as the Conyah country, where horses run wild, and everything is plentiful; in time, perhaps, enterprising men of commerce might tap even this region from it; at present however to get in the thin end of the wedge in the Barrie country at Bandazum is what is required and that which awaits to be done. —Sierra Leone Church Times.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following communication has been sent to us.

Ground-nuts being the staple produce, cannot be carried far from the farm—about two miles, not more. Thus the banks of the river on each side are studded with small trading ports, most of them up long, narrow creeks, often two or more ports in a creek, two to three or more miles from each other. Now at each of these ports must be a petty trader, whose trade in the season may average from 300 to 1,000 dollars, with some rare exceptions of a higher rate. Now a man may have from ten to fifty or more of these traders—as some merchants have—sculling about the river; he cannot constantly supervise these tenders; as a general rule, a man cannot manage to visit more than two of these ports a day, and then only when they are, say, within five miles of each other, as the creeks may be only accessible on the flood-tide. Thus a man who wishes to do a large business in the river must employ a staff of traders, who, even when under supervision, have matters mostly in their own power, and who, if dishonest, should be forced by the law to be the contrary. No European or educated and well-trained native can go up the Gambia River, and by himself, at present, do a business that will pay him, without the aid of traders, unless the native farmers can be induced to provide themselves with canoes, and ship the produce to central factories—say one every twenty miles—and sell it there direct to the European. This I know they will not do.

110,"Liberia's economic development is hindered by restrictive land tenure laws and lack of foreign capital investment, which limit agricultural and industrial growth and integration into global markets.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the factors hindering Liberia's economic development, particularly in relation to restrictive land tenure laws and foreign capital investment. The General History of Africa highlights the lack of foreign capital investment as a significant issue, especially in the context of mineral resource exploitation, where large-scale investments were necessary. It also notes the dominance of foreign firms in Liberia's economy, aligning with the claim of limited integration into global markets. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention restrictive land tenure laws as a hindrance, instead emphasizing broader economic challenges such as trade decline, agricultural setbacks, global market fluctuations, and reliance on foreign loans, which constrained growth. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim by highlighting that foreigners are prohibited from owning land in Liberia, limiting their ability to invest in agriculture and other industries. This restriction is seen as a major obstacle to attracting foreign capital, necessary for infrastructure development and agricultural expansion.

Furthermore, the lack of capital is cited as a barrier to industrial growth, with a need for foreign investment to boost commodity production. Together, these sources suggest that while foreign capital was present, it often led to exploitative practices rather than sustainable growth, and that restrictive land policies and insufficient foreign investment are indeed significant factors impeding Liberia's economic development and integration into global markets.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide a nuanced view of Liberia's economic development, highlighting several factors that both align with and diverge from the claim. The text does not explicitly mention restrictive land tenure laws as a hindrance to economic development, which is a notable difference from the claim. However, it does emphasize the lack of foreign capital investment as a significant issue, particularly in the context of mineral resource exploitation, where foreign capital was necessary due to the scale of investment required. The text also discusses the dominance of foreign firms in Liberia's economy, which aligns with the claim's suggestion of limited integration into global markets. Furthermore, the paragraphs highlight the economic challenges faced by Liberia, such as the decline in trade and agriculture, the impact of global market fluctuations, and the heavy reliance on foreign loans, which constrained economic growth and development. These details suggest that while foreign capital was present, it was often tied to exploitative practices and did not necessarily lead to sustainable economic integration or growth, partially supporting the claim. Overall, the text provides a broader context of economic challenges beyond just land tenure laws and foreign capital investment, indicating a complex interplay of factors affecting Liberia's economic development.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that Liberia's economic development is hindered by restrictive land tenure laws and a lack of foreign capital investment. The articles highlight that foreigners are prohibited from owning land in Liberia, which limits their ability to invest in agriculture and other industries. This restriction is noted as a significant obstacle to attracting foreign capital, which is necessary for the development of infrastructure and the expansion of agricultural production. The articles also mention that the Liberian government has attempted to address this issue by authorizing the leasing of land to foreigners, but the implementation has been ineffective due to legislative hurdles. Additionally, the lack of capital is emphasized as a barrier to industrial growth, with references to the need for foreign investment to stimulate the production of commodities like sugar, coffee, and cotton. The articles suggest that without changes to land tenure laws and an influx of foreign capital, Liberia's integration into global markets and economic progress will remain limited.

First, Firestone became the largest employer of labour in Liberia$^{49}$ (see Plate 28.3). How› ever, most of the Liberian employees were unskilled or semi-skilled, doing mainly clearing and planting or working as artisans and mechanics. Secondly, Firestone built several health clinics and schools for its Liberian (and American) employees, and distributed rubber seedlings to Liberians wishing to plant rubber.$^{50}$ However, for several decades to come, Fire› stone's rubber production remained largely an enclave activity. It had few spread effects over, or linkages with, the largely undeveloped, peasant economy of Liberia, particularly rice production in which over 80% of the indigenous Liberians were engaged. Only in 1935, when substantial exports of rubber commenced, did rubber emerge as Liberia's major export commodity (and remained so till 1961 when iron ore superseded it). 51 The year 1935 was significant in two other respects.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

These included an upward revision of the tariff, the reopening of the Liberian hinterland to foreign traders (closed to foreigners since the outbreak of the First World War), and the raising of port and harbour dues.$^{43}$ Simultaneously, the Liberian government welcomed plans by the Universal Negro Improve› ment Association, an American-based nationalist movement of New World blacks led by the Jamaican, Marcus Garvey, to bring capital and black immigrants to Liberia to develop her resources. But those plans never materialized. 44 Fortunately for Liberia, as from late 1923, the performance of the Liberian economy gradually improved.

Firestone obtained from the Liberian government the right to lease for ninety-nine years up to one million acres in Liberia to grow and export rubber, and Liberia secured a loan of $5000000 from the Finance Corporation of America to develop infrastructure including roads, hospitals and schools, as well as to pay her debts.$^{48}$ The loan, which received United States government support, greatly increased the influence of Firestone and the United States in Liberia."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Minerals', 'content': 'With the exception of a few cases, mineral resources were exploited with foreign capital. Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'The outcome of the Scramble and partition for Liberia and Ethiopia', 'content': ""No less hopeless was the internal situation.

This indebtedness enabled the imperial powers to constantly interfere in the internal affairs of Liberia during the period under review in a way that they never did in Ethiopia where they were never provided with the cause nor the excuse so to do. Throughout the last three decades of the nineteenth century, the imperial powers sent mission upon mission to Liberia to offer aid to her to pay her debts if she would come under their protection.

In spite of its acknowledged, traditional friendship with Liberia, the United States demonstrated numerous times over during the forced labour crisis that it toed the line of the European colonial powers who had designs on Liberia's sovereignty, particularly in supporting the plan for an international governing commission over Liberia.\nThe great diplomatic competence of the Liberian Government, particu› larly of Liberia's brilliant intellectual President, Edwin J.

However, since Ethiopian leaders including Haile Sellassie were also competent in diplomacy and ardent guardians of their country's sovereignty, the survival of Liberia seems to dwell ultimately in the fact that Ethiopia had a mad, blood-thirsty imperial power as a neighbour who was bent on territorial aggrandizement and above all on avenging Adowa, and therefore on actually attacking Ethiopia.

And this is precisely what the new Carthage on the Atlantic finds a difficulty in furnishing. She has an ample territory, because it is without limits toward the interior—a vast extent, therefore, of public lands—a soil of great fertility—an orderly, established Government—institutions that function well—all the elements, in fine, of future greatness and prosperity. All except one. In civilised population she is deficient. Consequently her public revenue is small—too small to allow of any portion being hypothecated for interest of debt. It is impossible to extract a large revenue from fifteen thousand people. And this is at present the sum of the civilised portion of Liberia. Under the Customs' Duties Act, which will come into operation in 1864, and through which the Government will receive import duties upon cargoes now sold along the coast without any payment to the State, the revenue will no doubt increase. But the increase, though important for general administrative wants, will do little, for many years to come, toward the great object we are now treating of—viz., the creating a surplus for payment of interest on a foreign debt.

It has, therefore, given us great satisfaction to hear that there are now on the banks of the St. Paul\'s River alone 458 acres of land under sugar-cane cultivation, of which above 100 acres have been planted this year. The estimate of crop which has been sent to us from these plantations seems to be, however, very low; so low, that we think there must be some error, unless a larger portion of the cane than we are aware of is of too recent planting to give good crops this season. The produce is returned at 307 tons of sugar and 160 tons of molasses. The plantation of one of our correspondents alone has produced 100 tons. We should have been glad to see the cotton industry well established in Liberia; but as sugar planting has been preferred, and as both soil and climate are admirably adapted for the cane, we expect shortly to find Liberia among the great sugar-producing countries.

We think it is worth their while for the Liberians resolutely to set themselves about the inquiry as to how far their laws and regulations with regard to foreigners and to the tenure of land may be chargeable with the great evil of impeding the introduction of that which is the sinew of agriculture, as well as of war. We see no reason why, if undoubted security for foreign capital invested in agriculture could be obtained in Liberia—no reason why English money should not flow in to their assistance, so as to enable an intelligent planter, for instance, who has managed on his own resources to raise 100,000 pounds of sugar a-year, to increase that quantity within a few years to a million or to ten millions of pounds. Land is there in abundance, labour, we are informed, may be procured when there is money to pay the labourers, and under proper regulations, an estate that has been so far cleared and cultivated and supplied as to produce and manufacture fifty tons of sugar a-year, ought to be an available security for capital that would suffice to clear the land and extend the cultivation to five hundred tons a-year, if the money were well applied.

No foreigner can possess land or houses in Liberia. Consequently, no foreigner can hold land or houses in Liberia as a security for capital advanced.

We repeat that we hope the new President of Liberia will exhibit the good sense of putting an end to what only seems to make Liberia ridiculous. A state with a gross revenue of about 10,000l. a-year, without (as Mr. Roye over and over again officially asserted in answer to just claims) a single cent* in its treasury, and unable to pay the salaries of its home officers, can only be made absurd by reiterated puffs of Liberian breakfasts, Liberian banquets, Liberian annual balls, &c. There may be new modes of making private fortunes, but there is no new mode of building up states. This can only be accomplished by the patient industry of their people and the development of natural, agricultural, and mineral resources. A loan, the annual interest on which is almost equal to the gross revenue, will not do it; but only serve to plunge the country deeper into debt and dishonour. Liberia ought not to have thought of raising money by loan until she possessed a surplus revenue at least equal to the charge that would fall upon her treasury for the annual interest thereon—a real, not a supposititious or purely imaginary surplus. Such an operation, if wisely conducted, is a mere capitalisation of the annual surplus; and, if raised without too great sacrifices, and honestly and economically applied in forwarding reproductive works, may often be very useful in creating additional public resources while increasing the well-being of the people. Liberia, without capitalists of her own, poor—we may almost say with truth, penniless—repels, instead of inviting, capital from other countries (except in the instance of the late most unjustifiable loan). She claims to possess a very large territory—600 miles of sea-board, unbounded as regards the interior, and is still greedily seeking to have her title acknowledged to other territories, such as the Gallinas, &c. Her immigrant population from the States is only about 15,000 to 17,000, yet no one can buy or own land, houses, &c., but an African—a Liberian. Thus she has made her bed, and an uncomfortable one it is; many of her population—we write of that immigrant population—starving in a land of immense natural resources, and very advantageously situate both as regards Europe and America. While the slave-trade was still in vigour, and before Liberia had been acknowledged as an African State by European Powers and by the United States, we can understand that there might be reasonable grounds for excluding Europeans or other strangers from possession of the soil. But, thanks to the indefatigable efforts of the now venerable as respected Mr. Gerard Ralston, so many years unpaid Consul-General, and who never aspired to be an ""excellency,"" Liberia has been acknowledged by every European Power; the slave-trade from Africa is for ever at an end; and even slavery itself is rapidly disappearing everywhere, except in the native heathen countries of Africa. There could no longer be any danger to Liberians in permitting Europeans to purchase as much land as they may choose. They would not buy more than they could utilise by their capital; they could only utilise what they might purchase by employing Liberians, by which in a short time many of these might be enriched, and many more be made comfortable, having their wants properly supplied by means of wages for their labour. Sugar, cotton, coffee, might be produced in large quantities for the European market, while it is notorious that enterprising men, owners of soil, having capital to work with, and with life and property duly protected, might soon double or treble the production of that great African staple, palm-oil. Europeans would never so throng the country as to be dangerous to the Liberians; and we see no other mode by which Liberia can progress than by welcoming them. With regard to the money lately raised by the loan in England, we now say distinctly and unhesitatingly—as we have before indicated—that in our opinion there is but one honourable course for Liberia to pursue. She cannot, with any regard for her own character, denounce and imprison the men who have raised the money for her and at the same time herself appropriate the plunder. She ought to restore to the bondholders all that remains of the money they have paid on their bonds, on condition of their giving up those bonds to be cancelled in exchange for that money, and for new bonds at par with 5 per cent. interest, for the balance which her poverty will not allow her at present to restore. Then, conducting herself modestly, without creating ""excellencies"" and ""lady honourables,"" without puffing English breakfasts, banquets, and so-called annual Liberian balls, she will soon become respected, and enlist the sympathies of the wise and the good of all countries. She has the choice of good and evil now before her. We have as above briefly indicated what she will become if she choose the good; but if the temptation be too great for her—if she cannot resist appropriating to herself what remains of the loan money, she plunges into an abyss where nothing can save her from contempt and shame.'}, {'id': 2158, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA RIDICULOUS, OR LIBERIA RESPECTED.', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA RIDICULOUS, OR LIBERIA RESPECTED.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1872#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_02_1872', 'content': 'The preposterous humbug of so-called Liberian banquets, &c., has, we hope, at last culminated.

They would not buy more than they could utilise by their capital; they could only utilise what they might purchase by employing Liberians, by which in a short time many of these might be enriched, and many more be made comfortable, having their wants properly supplied by means of wages for their labour. Sugar, cotton, coffee, might be produced in large quantities for the European market, while it is notorious that enterprising men, owners of soil, having capital to work with, and with life and property duly protected, might soon double or treble the production of that great African staple, palm-oil. Europeans would never so throng the country as to be dangerous to the Liberians; and we see no other mode by which Liberia can progress than by welcoming them. With regard to the money lately raised by the loan in England, we now say distinctly and unhesitatingly—as we have before indicated—that in our opinion there is but one honourable course for Liberia to pursue. She cannot, with any regard for her own character, denounce and imprison the men who have raised the money for her and at the same time herself appropriate the plunder. She ought to restore to the bondholders all that remains of the money they have paid on their bonds, on condition of their giving up those bonds to be cancelled in exchange for that money, and for new bonds at par with 5 per cent. interest, for the balance which her poverty will not allow her at present to restore. Then, conducting herself modestly, without creating ""excellencies"" and ""lady honourables,"" without puffing English breakfasts, banquets, and so-called annual Liberian balls, she will soon become respected, and enlist the sympathies of the wise and the good of all countries. She has the choice of good and evil now before her. We have as above briefly indicated what she will become if she choose the good; but if the temptation be too great for her—if she cannot resist appropriating to herself what remains of the loan money, she plunges into an abyss where nothing can save her from contempt and shame.'}, {'id': 3126, 'article_title': 'LANDS IN LIBERIA', 'full_section_title': 'LANDS IN LIBERIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-17', 'issue_date': '01_06_1876', 'content': 'may help to develop the great natural resources of their rich and extensive territories. What has been already done by Liberians in sugar and coffee cultivation, and other branches of agricultural industry, is invaluable under these circumstances, as showing what an admirable field there is in Liberia for the judicious employment of capital under a settled government. There is a large aboriginal population ready for employment by those who may possess the means of payment for labour, not only in planting and securing crops, but in those indispensable accessories in new countries—the formation of roads, improving the navigation of rivers, and introducing that machinery which adds so much to the efficiency of manual labour. For all these accessories, capital realized elsewhere is absolutely necessary. Without that capital in the hands of the community, the government of Liberia has been, like the fabled Tantalus, surrounded by the life-giving element, but unable to appropriate it for its own use and safety. It has been suffering from a painful thirst of revenues which can only be supplied by the development of natural resources, and the opening up and utilizing land and water routes of communication with the interior, by means of which the produce of the soil may be conveyed with speed and at moderate cost to its sea-ports for shipment to the European and American markets. We are not at all sure that the Liberian authorities have, in the new laws which have been enacted, and which we this month publish, done all that is wanting to induce foreigners with capital to settle among them and undertake the cultivation and improvements that their country so greatly needs; but we feel sure that, having once entered on the right path, as they have now done, they will not be slow in supplementing these new laws by others that may be found to be indispensable for the realization of the important objects they have in view. We may possibly have more time fully to consider this subject in all its bearings before our next issue. Our only object, in any remarks we may feel bound to make, will be the good of Liberia and its citizens, which can only be effectively advanced by the removal of every obstacle that might deter foreign capital and intelligence from entering on that most promising field of labour which now invites them in this rich country of Western Africa, not distant more than fifteen days by steam from the ever-craving markets of Great Britain.'}, {'id': 3302, 'article_title': 'Lease of Lands in Liberia to Foreigners', 'full_section_title': 'Lease of Lands in Liberia to Foreigners', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1877#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_03_1877', 'content': 'It may not be improper to invite your attention to the Act of your last Session ""authorizing the Government of Liberia to lease lands to foreigners,"" which it was believed would have recommended itself to persons wishing to engage in enterprise in this country.

We are kept down in this place next to servitude; our will is not our own; a few men who are in command of a little property keep us knuckle down to them. If we are in their employment we are seldom paid in money, but are obliged to take up such estables as they choose to give us. If a captain or supercargo comes, and wishes to give some of the enterprising young men of this place a little trust, these merchants here, though doing business on trust themselves, will oppose it, and advise the parties not to give them trust. If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports. These things can be easily remedied if better steps were to be taken, and selfishness and self-conceit put away.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-05-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-29', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Liberian Republic', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The shores of this part of the world (Harper, Liberia) present a solitary and melancholy appearance. Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks. This river has been ascended for nearly 200 miles, and is stated to be navigable for that distance. This country is more valuable in every way than our Gold Coast Colony: it possesses three or four fairly good harbours, whereas the latter cannot boast of one. There is an absence of that terrible surf which makes landing or the transference of cargo almost impossible, and the country itself appears to be more productive, to have greater mineral wealth, and to ""tap"" a more valuable part of the Dark Continent. The estimated population of Liberia is about 767,000, only about 30,000 of whom are descendants of freed slaves from the United States, the remainder being the aborigines or ""heathen,"" as they are termed by the ""Liberians.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Condemnation of the Liberian Loan', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**CONDEMNATION OF THE LIBERIAN LOAN.**\n\nThe following are editorial remarks from the *Republican*, published in Monrovia August 12, 1871, criticising a letter in support of a loan which appeared in the Government paper, which has been resuscitated with the expectation of British silver flowing into the Government chest to support it. The editor writes as follows:—\n\n""Our financier has failed to find out, it seems; that of all things most especially in systems of public economy and finance, no one nation can exactly use or adopt that of another. \'A system made for one nation,\' says a learned authority on political economy, \'and adapted to its condition and interests, may be ruinous to another—will certainly be more or less hurtful.\' So that in taking up his pen to advise on political money matters and financial schemes in Liberia, our financier should have, first of all, realised that he was writing of and for Liberia. Had he done this he certainly would have never advised in one breath the increase of Liberia\'s custom dues, and in the next breath a laying on of heavy taxes. The idea is too preposterous. Does he mean to borrow money for the express purpose of grinding the poor people to death with taxes? Taxes indirect in the shape of duties; taxes direct as his No. IV. argues. Certainly our financiering friend, though a scholar, has forgotten the old Latin proverb, *Ne sutor ultra crepidam*—don\'t let a shoemaker go beyond his last. What supposes he a direct tax, on the head, if he pleases, of each taxable man in Liberia, say of ten dollars per head, would pay? Now suppose, Mr. Financier, on a direct tax scale you charge every man ten dollars; with a voting population of 2,000, you will get twenty thousand dollars. Now what is twenty thousand dollars to a State whose legislative expenses alone scarcely ever go below twenty thousand? With judiciary, civil list, and other expenses doubling this amount, our doctrine is not, as our reviewer tries to show it to be, that Liberia does not need money. Liberia needs money as a State, and most of all she needs the operation of monetary schemes, plans, and uses within the country—such as extensive farming operations, large manufactories, banks, &c., through which the willing labour and energies of the people could find employment and adequate remuneration on the live-and-let-live principle. Throw employment open to the people adapted to their abilities and the peculiarities of their natural situation, give them opportunities to honestly acquire ease, competence, wealth, and you have shown yourself a public benefactor, a worthy writer on political economy.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-08-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1871#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress of Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Every true friend of Africa and its peoples must feel a deep interest in Liberia. The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Liberia Coffee Estates Company, originally concocted by Mr. Blyden and Mr. Chinery, and which fell on successive occasions into so much disrepute at Monrovia, in the course of its chameleon-like existence, has at last culminated in a grand Company with a nominal capital of no less than 150,000l., in 15,000 shares of 10l. each, under the title of ""The Liberia Coffee Company (Limited).""

Every acre of land fronting the river for the distance above named is secured for agricultural purposes. Many are purchasing and cultivating farms several miles back of those fronting the stream. The people are becoming aroused to the advantages of agricultural industry. Coffee and sugar are now, and will be for a long time to come, Liberia\'s best medium of exchange. These products will buy what otherwise can be purchased only with gold and silver. The farms are not yet very extensive, but the excessive fertility and perpetuated fruitfulness of the soil, and its adaptedness to the growth of these articles, readily compensate for their contraction. Perhaps in these particulars the world affords no soil superior. Four steam sugar mills now operate along the river, the most extensive of which belong to L. L. Lloyd, Esq., of 35-horse power. This gentleman operates quite extensively, employing from fifty to sixty hands on his sugar farm, still he does not carry on as large a business in that line as some of his neighbours. It is said that Mr. Sharp manufactured about 60,000 pounds of sugar last season. This season he has a prospect of doubling the amount. Others operate equally extensively.

Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised.

In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

By 1827, however, an embryonic development process had started. The main emphasis was laid, at first, on the production of food, and especially of rice, but efforts were also directed towards the cultivation of export crops and the exploitation of local natural resources: in the first category there were sugar, ginger and indigo, and in the second there were coffee and exotic timber. An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper. Here again, the main interest lay in the creation of a reliable economic substitute for the slave trade: in 1824 fifty Western ships loaded 200000 dollars' worth of timber in the Sierra Leone estuary.$^{38}$ Favourable conditions combined to create a certain amount of wealth (it can hardly be described as capital) within the colony. Its ships began to ply the waters along the West African coast as far as the Bight of Biafra. Foreign ships were thenceforth able to put in safely to ports in the estuary for the purpose of the legitimate trade so earnestly desired by the abolitionists. However, the significance of this 'take-off' should not be exaggerated: it simply showed that the experiment was viable, with a minimum of administrative support from the European metropolis.\nAll things considered, the British government's action in 1853 in making the Sierra Leoneans subjects of the Crown represented implicit recognition of the fact that a heterogeneous medley of cultures had been welded together into a viable Creole society.

Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930. Cotton, palm oil, coffee, groundnuts and cocoa illustrate such characteristics in the parts of the continent with which they are respectively associated.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: North Africa', 'section_title': 'Part II: Libya, Egypt and the Sudan > Egypt > Exported-oriented economy > The development of the infrastructure', 'content': 'Said were built on the Suez Canal, which was opened for navigation in 1869.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long. A number of African as well as alien merchants rapidly entered into the competition for slaves and ivory.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

There was every reason to conclude that the effects of the commercial crisis from which the Eastern Province more particularly has suffered so severely were gradually passing away, and that very shortly matters would assume a generally prosperous aspect, and business be carried on at once in a prudent and profitable way. Large quantities of wool had been sent to market, and there seemed to be a disposition amongst growers to devote more care to its preparation, so as to improve its quality and enhance its value. The continued drought had, however, exercised a prejudicial, and often destructive influence upon the flocks, so as in some cases to sweep away a considerable portion of the farmers' profits for the year. Whole districts in some parts of the colony were described as being literally parched up and deprived both of grass and water; but there were some districts which had not suffered in this way, and it was hoped that the drought would speedily come to an end.

These returns are held to justify the statement of the Governor at the recent Grahamstown banquet that after years of depression the tide had now turned, and South Africa might look forward to an era of renewed prosperity.\n\nThe South African Jubilee Exhibition was opened at Grahamstown by Sir Hercules Robinson on Dec. 15, and has proved an unqualified success. His Excellency, in the course of his remarks on the occasion, eulogized the energy with which the project had been carried out, and said: ""The loyalty of the citizens could have found no more appropriate form of expressing itself, Her Majesty and her late Consort being the originators and patrons of such institutions."" The Governor also laid great emphasis upon the public benefit and the impetus to trade likely to accrue from the present Exhibition.\n\nAt a banquet given in his honour at Grahamstown, Sir Hercules Robinson spoke in terms of admiration of the city and its institutions, and referred to the possibility of the seat of government being removed thither during a portion of the year. On the political outlook his Excellency remarked: ""We have recently concluded postal, telegraphic, extradition, and other conventions with neighbouring Republics, and if an agreement in Customs and railway matters can also be come to at the approaching conference, a practical union, short only of political confederation, will then have been achieved. No doubt there are many difficulties in the way, but the true policy for South Africa would be a Customs union between all colonies and States which would admit of one uniform tariff against the outside world, and unrestricted trade internally and coastwise throughout the whole of South Africa. Railways might then be laid by the routes best suited for developing the resources of the whole country.""\n\nAt a conference held in connexion with this Exhibition, it was resolved to form a South African Manufacturers\' Association.

Never before did the crops look so green, advanced, and promising in March and April. All this is owing to a steady succession of genial rainfalls. The crop of Sugar is expected to be very large. This is very important for the colony, because Natal sugar has now become a favourite in the Australian markets. Coffee, Cotton, and all other products, look most promising, and a generally good yield is anticipated. Cotton, Flax, and other textile fabrics, are occupying attention in the colony. The average yield of Sea Island cotton will, it is said, be about 400lbs. of ginned cotton per acre. It is also now affirmed that cotton planting and sugar planting may be carried on successfully together, because at the time when labour is most wanted in the cotton fields it is least needed in the cane fields. Several patches of cotton, of a few acres each, are to be seen this year. But unless the Kafirs take to labour in the cotton fields, the labour question will be the great difficulty. The Flax that has been experimentally grown has given abundant yield, and the quality is reported as ""very good."" Wool is to become the favourite product of the upper country. There are continual importations of Sheep from the Cape, and of Rams of good breed from Australia and England. Some Alpacas are also expected from Australia.

Nearly the whole of the expenditure is for administration, leaving little for public works and the development of the resources of the settlements. The exports during the past ten years show considerable fluctuations in value, depending partly on the market value of the staple products, and partly on the more or less disturbed state of the interior, where the native tribes are constantly at war with each other. In 1875, the value of the exports on the Gold Coast was £327,012; in 1879, it was £751,850; in 1881, 1882, and 1883, it hovered round £350,000; suddenly advancing to £667,000 in 1884. For Lagos, the exports were valued at £517,535 in 1875, £734,707 in 1877, £460,000 in 1881, £594,000 in 1883, and £672,000 in 1884. For the last ten years the exports of Sierra Leone have kept pretty steadily at about £580,000; in 1876 they sank to £297,000, and in 1882 and 1883 rose to £420,000 and £442,000.

The average prices in Europe of the more important native products have stood even lower than during the previous twelve months, while the prolonged continuance of low prices in Africa has apparently disheartened the native producer, and tended to diminish the quantity as well as the value of his out-turn. In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos. Great numbers of clerks and artisans, anxious for engagements as heretofore at various parts of the coast, are unable to obtain employment, or only at reduced rates of wages.\n\nTo these communities 1888 will probably bring good tidings. It has been stated, on apparently good authority, that early in the new year the so-called ""oil rivers""—now under intermittent Consular jurisdiction—will be formed into a Colony. The experiences of Lagos and the Gold Coast enable us to predict, with tolerable certainty, the results which will follow from this policy. These valuable regions will be rapidly settled and opened up to trade. Hitherto, owing to the prevalence of the barter system, the unsettled condition of the tribes, and the absence of order and justice, only wealthy European houses have been able to make the necessary provisions.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1888#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Annual Report of the Gold Coast Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**Agriculture.**—The staple food crops of the country are maize, plantains, yams, cassada, ground-nuts, and in some districts, rice. Many parts of the Colony are adapted for the cultivation of rice, and a profitable trade might be carried on therein. The tobacco plant might also be cultivated with advantage. During the last year 744,508 lb. of tobacco was imported into the Colony at the value of £17,591.\n\nThe principal commercial product is the oil palm, which, however, has never been systematically cultivated. The means adopted by the natives for extracting the oil are miserably defective, causing considerable waste. Probably also not more than half the oil-producing palm trees are made use of, the nuts from the remaining trees being allowed to rot on the ground. The want of proper means of communication between the plantations and the trade ports is seriously felt. Better means of communication would lessen the cost of transport and open out the oil-producing districts.\n\nNext in importance are the rubber trees. There was practically no trade in rubber ten years ago, but in 1882 a trade was stimulated, and rubber is now come to be regarded one of the most important staple exports of the Colony. The following figures show the progress which has been made in the decade: 1883, 57,913 lb., £2,371; 1884, 123,843 lb., £18,619; 1885, 93,726 lb., £30,234; 1886, 1,549,121 lb., £69,911; 1887, 1,306,252 lb., £62,430; 1888, 878,367 lb., £38,048; 1889, 1,241,628 lb., £55,197; 1890, 3,361,055 lb., £231,281; 1891, 2,946,913 lb., £198,901; 1892, 2,663,020 lb., £166,659.\n\nCoffee and cotton are cultivated in small quantities and the soil is admirably adapted for their growth. Cotton is indigenous and has been used by the Natives from time immemorial. The raw material has never become a staple export, and the cultivation of it is mainly carried on by the natives who inhabit the districts far from the coast, where yarn of British manufacture is more expensive than the material they can raise on their own soil. In 1890 larger quantities of Egyptian cotton were imported by the Government to encourage the cultivation of the plant.\n\nof cotton, and the samples obtained were valued at a higher figure than any previously received from West Africa. The seed has been distributed throughout the Colony, but the want of the means of transport militate against its cultivation on a scale beyond sufficient to supply local wants.\n\nSeveral coffee and cocoa plantations have recently been started, and are likely to be attended with success and profit to the owners. Many valuable fibre plants are indigenous. Attempts have been made to develop an industry in African piassava fibre, but not as yet with success. The kola tree, the nuts of which combine the best qualities of coffee and cocoa, is indigenous to the country. A small trade has been established, and more will, it is believed, be heard of kola nuts as an article of export.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1894#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SOUTH AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The success of the new Natal Loan of £1,130,200 is one of the most satisfactory features in the history of South Africa during the past month. The total amount subscribed was £6,059,900, or five times the sum offered. The average price realized was £100 19s. 6d. On the afternoon of the day on which the tenders were opened, the loan was quoted on 'Change at 3¼ to 3¾ premium on the minimum price of 98 per cent. This almost unlooked-for success is the more gratifying since it conclusively proves that Englishmen at home have not lost faith in the recuperative powers of South Africa. The new loan will be chiefly devoted to the extension of the railway system of the colony; and wherever the iron horse goes trade must undoubtedly follow. Natal is by no means in such a bad condition as some people imagine. Its growth is sufficiently shown by the fact that the revenue has steadily increased from £180,000 in 1872 to £657,000 in 1882. Last year there was a decrease, though not so very considerable, taking into consideration the depressed condition of South Africa generally. For the first nine months of 1883 the value of imports was only £1,326,194, as against £1,652,691 for the corresponding period of 1882; but during the same period exports increased in value from £562,067 to £623,892. The imports, while showing a serious decrease, almost exactly correspond in value with the imports for the first nine months of 1881, so that the falling off only represents a period of two years' retrocession.\n\nThe old storeship *London*, so long stationed at Zanzibar has at length disappeared from the official Navy List. The vessel has been for some time unseaworthy, and her sanitary condition is admittedly of the worst, as those who have had the misfortune to be berthed in her can testify. The tropical waters are so destructive that it is extremely doubtful whether her timbers are not too rotten to bear the voyage home to be broken up. We believe that Rear-Admiral Sir William Hewett, while at Bombay recently, was specially directed by the Lords of the Admiralty to inspect and report upon her condition; but Egyptian complications precluded this being carried into effect. There is one gloomy reminiscence connected with the vessel, as the late Commander of the *London*, Captain Brownrigg, was slain off the island of Pemba while in the steam-launch endeavouring to capture a slave-dhow. However, the vessel has done some good work in her day in putting down the iniquitous slave-trade. There is not a slaver off the coast who has not trembled when his dhow, with its unhappy freight, has been sighted by the steam-launch of the *London*. But while the old storeship will soon be a thing of the past, it must not be imagined that the slavers will benefit thereby; for Captain C. E. Foote, Commander Gissing, and others have been appointed and assumed duty as Consul and Vice-Consuls to places in the interior of Africa, with the view of suppressing the slave-trade."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1884#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Produce Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'LIVERPOOL, AUGUST 28.\n\n**SUGAR.**—Active demand, chiefly from the trade, and a large business done at steadily hardening prices.

Revenue and trade increased, although there is no other Colony in the Empire which has the advantage of being so lightly taxed; so that the imposition of additional taxes should not be difficult when the time comes for various public works, especially those needed to improve the sanitation and to develop the country. The total trade amounted to £1,809,340, of which exports absorbed £877,803. In the last six years the trade has increased upwards of 55 per cent. The chief imports are piece goods, hardware, food-stuffs, and alcohol, while the exports are palm oil and kernels, rubber, gold dust, &c. The Customs revenue is largely derived from spirits, and the Acting-Governor takes occasion to mention that the reputation of trade gin as specially deleterious is undeserved. From an analysis, which he gives, it appears that West African trade gin is not more or less deleterious than the gin sold all over London. The export of palm products amounted to about £225,000, and that of rubber to about £330,000. In the last six years about a million monkeys have been slaughtered on the Gold Coast for the sake of their skins; but this trade is decreasing, because the traders have to go further into the interior to find the monkeys they require. Last year over 90,000 skins, worth over £14,000, were exported.\n\nThe land in the Colony is not generally sufficiently cultivated, though the soil is rich and will produce almost any commodity. It abounds in the oil palm, mahogany, rubber and kola trees, and many other valuable woods; but, chiefly on account of the absence of proper roads and the general ignorance of the Natives, products which require a careful preparation of the soil and supervision have not been cultivated systematically.\n\nOn the subject of communications a passage from an address of the Governor to the Legislative Council is quoted: ""The conditions under which bulky produce is transported from the interior to the coast are such that, beyond a certain distance inland, products have no commercial value; a new producing sphere could be tapped if a railway of fifty or sixty miles in length were constructed, and trade could be further developed by the gradual extension of the line; it is therefore desirable to carry a railway inland from the place best adapted for development as a harbour.

The exports to the United Kingdom in 1891 was four times that to France, five times that to Germany, and twenty-five times that to the United States of America. These figures afford evidence that the trade of the Colony is expanding, a satisfactory feature in a community in which about one-sixth of the resident inhabitants is engaged in trading. Probably the large importations of recent years are not altogether the outcome of increased local consumption, as nearly one-half the imports find their way into the interior countries, and should more properly be classified as transit trade, the few ports in the Colony being mere commercial depots, where are landed the merchandise brought by vessels from different countries, whose manufactures find a market in this part of West Africa.

The total value of the exports was slightly less than in 1879, arising not from any deficiency in the crops, but from the desire of the cotton growers to hold their stock, which their easy circumstances enabled them to do. The proportion of exports sent to England was greater than in the previous year by nearly 70 per cent. on the whole. The increasing prosperity of the fellaheen was shown more markedly by the increase in the imports, which exceeded those of 1879 by 23 per cent. The nature of the increases is especially encouraging. It was in coal, for the greater use of machinery for irrigation purposes, and in machinery, which the fellaheen themselves imported from Great Britain to the extent of 80 per cent. more than in the previous year. They have been enabled to do this by the rapid rise of banks and other establishments which advance money at comparatively low rates, and so release the peasants from their subjection to the usurer of former times. The Chairman of the Bank of Egypt the other day complained that the competition among banks in that country prevents high profits being realised; and this state of things operates to the advantage of the Egyptian agriculturists, who, since the days of Joseph, have made their land the granary of the Old World. Experiments have been made in the growth of jute, and, although they have been on a small scale, and accompanied by conscious mistakes, the produce per acre was found to be equal, and the price realised for it in Scotland higher than the produce and price of the jute of Bengal.

In the first place the people of the northern oases such as Tafilâlet, Mzab, Ghadâmes, the Fezzân, AwdjUa, and Sïwa played a pivotal role in organizing and financing trade. Perhaps because of the strategic location of these oases and because the oases relied heavily on the trade of dates for grain from zones of rainfall agriculture farther north, oasis dwellers, with their long histories of trade, moved naturally into transSaharan commerce over the centuries as opportunities opened up. Nomadic groups such as the Ahaggar and Kel-Ewey Tuareg, the Tubu, and the Zuwaya of the central Sahara (a Beduin group not to be confused with zawiya clerical lineages in Mauritania) traded small quantities of slaves and other products on their own account, but they could not match the scale of sedentary merchants from the northern oases, who had financial backing from middlemen in Mediterranean ports and ultimately from Europe, especially when prices and conditions on the routes were favour¬ able. Consequently the main role of camel nomads was to provide transport animals, guides, and military escorts for caravans, and they also ran freight delivery services for merchants who were unable to or preferred not to accompany caravans.21 Most groups of Saharan nomads had a major stake in the trade that passed through their territory: Regibat on the route to western Morocco; Ait Khabbash (a segment of the Ait Atta) on the Tafilälet-Tüwät road; Chaamba on the routes north of Tüwat; Tuareg on the Tripoli-Kano route; Tubu on the Borno-Fezzän road; Mujabra and Zuwaya for traffic between Benghazi and Wadai; KabäbTsh on the Darb al-Arbaln (forty-day road) between Därfür and the lower Nile.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Central Africa in the fluctuating world economy of the nineteenth century', 'content': ""During the centuries that saw the gradual establishment of a system in which agriculture, stock-breeding, fishing and gathering were the main productive activities, a trade sector always existed in Central Africa, playing a more or less important role according to historical circumstances. Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': 'The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals. With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers. The family was the basic unit of production. It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary.

The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction. More commonly, the competition for captive labour generated intense hostility among and within trading factions. There are numerous examples of wars among the Chikunda bands, Yao chiefs and Swahili trading groups.$^{61}$ The dependence on European arms and alien intermediaries often left the indigenous trading communities quite vulnerable. The Portuguese, for example, exploited their role as suppliers of weapons to pressure the Chikunda bands to recognize Lisbon's limited authority over their territory.$^{62}$ Similarly, the Sena began to rely so heavily on their Arab allies that they jeopardized their sovereign status. 63 Even the powerful Bemba were not totally immune to pressures from Arab and Swahili traders. 64 Moreover, with the abolition of the slave trade, those classes or strata within them who profited from the trade - the aristocracy, merchants, warlords and landlords - searched desperately for new commodities such as wax, coffee, groundnuts, and vegetable oils which they could extract from their subordinates or acquire through commerce in order to ensure a constant supply of European consumer goods and weapons necessary to maintain their privileged position. In some regions this legitimate com› merce offered new opportunities for aspiring itinerant traders to accumulate capital and for the growth of peasant agriculture.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650. The numbers by 1750 were about triple those of 1650. 4"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""As long as Africa was 'outside' the world-economy, the 'cost' of a slave to the slave-owner was the expense of procurement plus maintenance plus supervision (prorated for his/her life as a slave) divided by total work output during his/her life as a slave. The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy. The first long economic and geographic expan› sion of the capitalist world-economy had occurred between 1450 and 160050. In that period, no part of Africa could be said to have been part of this historical system. The period 1600/50-1730/50 was, for the capitalist worldeconomy, a period of relative stagnation, of taking a breath, of consolidation, primarily within the geographic zones that had already been included in the sixteenth century. It was still largely true at this time that no part of Africa could be said to have been incorporated into this system (with the reservations noted about the changing structure of the slave trade). 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

The Sierra Leone coast, involved early, was a significant exporter only as of the middle of the eighteenth century. South-east Africa became a major source only in the nineteenth century. procedures for obtaining their quarry.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained.

For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom.

It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Page 154\n\nIts value. If plentiful supplies of indigo of superior quality may be obtained at comparatively low prices from West Africa, it is the duty of those interested in the West Coast trade to use their best influence in the development of what promises to become an important and profitable branch of commerce for them. Experience will soon point out to them the best methods of extracting the dye; the expense of so doing should not be much, but the means employed should be such as to insure a fair chance to the African product. As to transit, the goods can be brought from Sierra Leone to Liverpool in about a fortnight, and there are no expenses worth considering beyond those of sea carriage; while nearly two months are occupied in conveying the indigo from Tirhoot to London, and the cost is at least double that from Sierra Leone. A fair examination of the whole facts would seem to indicate that the African merchants have within their grasp, a new and profitable branch of trade, which is capable, too of an almost infinite development.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE IVORY TRADE OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Ivory of the best quality comes from the West Coast of Africa, under the names of Cameroon, Angola, and Gaboon ivory. This is brought down from the interior, and retains a large proportion of the fat or gelatine, from the fact, probably, that it is from the recently living animals. In this state it is called green ivory. It is not so white as the kinds called white ivory, which have been lying a longer time exposed to the heat of the sun until the animal matter has disappeared. The excellence of green ivory consists in its greater toughness and in its growing whiter by age, instead of yellow, as is the case with the whiter varieties. Yet buyers of cutlery, through ignorance of these qualities, usually prefer the whiter kinds, which on that account are more in demand for the Sheffield trade, and have more than doubled in price since 1879.\n\nThe sales of ivory occur every three months at London and Liverpool, and sales are also held at irregular intervals at Rotterdam. At Liverpool, only ivory of the best quality is offered. Buyers from Germany and France and agents of American consumers attend these sales; and it is estimated that about one quarter of the whole amount goes to Sheffield, another quarter to London, and the other half to Germany, France, and the United States. There is just now great anxiety as to the future supply of ivory. The stocks in public warehouses are smaller than for many years past, and the rapid increase in prices is causing great anxiety to manufacturers. At a recent sale at Liverpool, the best African ivory sold by the ton at over 12s. 6d. per pound. This will explain the fact that the principal factor in the value of the best table cutlery is the handle. When the ivory comes into the hands of the cutler, much skill is required to make the most of the material, and every scrap is turned to account. After cutting out the scales of all sizes for pocket-knives, and the solid handles for table cutlery, the small pieces are usually sold to the button-makers, or may be made into pearls. These latter are the small pieces of ivory, pearl, or horn inserted into the handles of tea and coffee pots as non-conductors of heat, and are so called because they were originally made of pearl. The fine sawdust is sold for fertilising purposes, for the manufacture of gelatine, and for making a sizing used in the manufacture of lace fabrics. The refuse still remaining goes to the makers of ivory black. The proportion of this residuum is about fifteen pounds to the hundredweight, and sells at from £16 to £20 per ton. Many efforts have been made to devise some method for the solidification of ivory dust, but as yet without success. Great skill is required in the cutting of ivory, as of wood, to bring out the beauty of the grain.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Outlook in the Congo Basin', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In view of increased interest in the Congo question, the vigorous resistance to any interference with the freedom of trade in those regions, and the feeling that the condition of trade makes the opening of new markets for the staple manufactures of this district a necessity, the Congo basin affords a suitable region for attempts to carry into effect the idea suggested at the annual meeting of the Manchester Guardian Trade Protection Society. One of the speakers suggested that as trade appears to be suffering from the fact that production exceeds consumption, it would be a good thing if capital was more systematically devoted to the work of distribution. We must conclude that some impulse to the distribution of wealth is needed; and a wider distribution of mercantile profits would doubtless be a consequence of the application of the joint-stock principle to mercantile enterprise.\n\nThere is a well-founded belief that the economic development of Africa will be a work of time, and that it is not at all likely to advance by ""leaps and bounds."" The fact is, that so far as the West Coast is concerned, experienced authorities have pointed out that the black man must be interested in cultivation if trade is to be permanent and African communities are to become large consumers of European manufactures. At the present rate of indiscriminate collection, the supplies of ivory must eventually be exhausted, the India-rubber and other plants be destroyed, and the whole country be converted into a waste. It is upon the interior that the interest of the trading and investing public is concentrated, because it is the region of untried possibilities. But the prudent ask whether, assuming the existence of vast stores of produce and favourable conditions of development and progress, markets can be found at paying prices for the produce which Central Africa may yield. It is a question of cost as well as of productiveness. African rivers are interrupted by cataracts from which the great rivers of other continents still only partially developed are free. It is true that the construction of railways is hinted at, but questions arise as to what will be the cost of such railways, who will provide the capital, how long before they become remunerative, and how many transhipments will be required; for it is conceivable that the mere cost of transporting produce to the consuming markets might prove greater than the price obtainable for them.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""We have pretty well worked up about three-fourths of the markets of the world and glutted them, leaving the remainder, Africa, almost untouched; for, as yet, except in South Africa, our trade has but barely penetrated beyond the coast line, and our merchants remain at the outposts competing with each other and over-working the local markets. Expeditions are rapidly following one another and giving us full information about the interior of Equatorial Africa. Railways and canals are proposed for the opening up of that part of Africa, and they will, years hence, no doubt, prove an incalculable benefit; but why should we wait for these costly works? Why not utilize the arteries already provided by nature for traffic with the interior? Northwest Africa is a market to a great extent as yet unworked. The markets of Sego and Timbuctoo, Hamdallahi, and other large towns on the Upper Niger are most inadequately supplied with British goods by caravans from Tunis, Tripoli, Mogador, and Senegal, and the carriage is so expensive that none but the lightest and most valuable can be imported across the desert. Now the French river, Senegal, though it drains the country for over 700 miles, is practically useless as a channel of commerce. It has a bad and dangerous bar. Ships have often to lie outside weeks, and even months, waiting to enter the port of St. Louis. Its channel into the interior is full of sand bars and rocks, obstructing navigation by even small craft for most of the year; and the tribes to the north-east of its head-waters, of Arab origin, are ferocious and predatory, living by plunder; therefore, commerce meets with danger and difficulty in their neighbourhood. About 180 miles to the south is the Gambia, which seems intended by nature to be the main road for commerce, civilization, and religion into North-west Africa. At all states of the tide, at all seasons of the year, you have a deep and safe channel over the bar; vessels of 2,000 to 3,000 tons can come in and anchor off Bathurst, and discharge and load. The traffic up the river is carried on by large cutters and schooners. Even oceangoing vessels of large tonnage go up to M\'Carthy Island, 185 miles from the mouth, and load. Lately, an ocean steamer, of about 900 tons, went there direct from Marseilles, and loaded there; and at the present moment, a French firm trading in Gambia is building a 1,200-ton steamer to run between Marseilles and that island every season, and discharge and load there, instead of breaking bulk at Bathurst. At M\'Carthy Island there are five fathoms of water in mid-channel. Then, vessels drawing ten feet of water can go up to Yarbutenda, 160 miles further; so that had we steamers suited for the trade, like the French vessels I have mentioned, they could load at Liverpool or London, reach Bathurst in twelve days, M\'Carthy Island in twenty-four hours, Yarbutenda in twenty-four hours more, making fourteen days in all.""', 'last_edit_date': '1879-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1879#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The natives of the interior are known to be eager for trade; but, unfortunately, the traffic in slaves is the principal means of paying for the small supplies of European goods which now reach them. The rivers Niger and Chadda, by means of steamers, can be made for legitimate commerce, and the produce in exchange would be chiefly Shea butter and cotton. The former is a valuable oil, and would be a new article of commerce, only a few tons having as yet been imported, while the cotton would be from an entirely new source of supply. Ivory would be attracted by the new markets when established; but this would merely be a diversion of trade, whereas the Shea butter and cotton would be a new trade created.\n\nIt is obvious that time will be required to develop this trade; the natives must, first of all, feel assured of a demand for such produce when raised, and time must elapse before they are accustomed to resort to the new markets for European goods in exchange for their produce. To effect this these markets must be kept constantly supplied.\n\nThe steamers necessary for these operations will cost upwards of 30,000l., and the outlay will not be much less than 40,000l. by the time they are placed on the Niger. The cost of coals and high wages, owing to the climate, render it very expensive to maintain steamers on the river, while there are no means of repair in case of accident to the hull or machinery.

The textbook highlights the rapid expansion of the ivory trade by the 1840s, which integrated the interior of East Africa into a coastal trading network. It underscores ivory as a major export commodity, with African merchants like the Yao, Bisa, and Chikunda expanding their commercial empires to meet the demands of new markets in Britain, the USA, and traditional Asian clients. This expansion paralleled the growth of the slave trade, indicating ivory's importance in the international commercial system. However, the textbook does not delve into the structured categorization and pricing based on quality and condition, which is a focal point of the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of this structured trade, detailing the categorization and pricing of ivory based on quality, condition, and size.

This meticulous categorization underscores the trade's structured nature. The articles also highlight the global reach of the ivory market, with sales in London and Liverpool and buyers from Germany, France, and the United States, further emphasizing its economic significance. Additionally, they mention concerns over future ivory supplies and the impact of fluctuating prices, while also addressing the trade's negative aspects, such as its ties to the slave trade and environmental consequences, which are not directly covered in the claim.

The roots for the growth of a commercial empire penetrating the interior of East Africa were also laid in the early part of the nineteenth century. By the 1840s the trade in ivory and slaves was expanding rapidly and was drawing the interior into the trading network already established on the coast.\nThere is a tendency to consider ivory and slaves as interconnected commodities of trade since in most cases they came from the same region and also since slaves could be employed to carry ivory. But the importance of this superficial inter-relationship has been exaggerated. Clearly, for long- distance trade, both ivory and slaves had to be exchanged for other bulky commodities, such as cloth, wire and beads which also had to be transported.\nA much more important inter-relationship centres on the fact that both commodities were involved in an international commercial system that was drawing East Africa into a subordinate role, and in turn influencing the development of trade in East Africa in the period prior to the establishment of colonialism. The fact is that East Africa was already drawn into the capitalist economic system prior to the actual establishment of colonial rule.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks. On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long. A number of African as well as alien merchants rapidly entered into the competition for slaves and ivory.

Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Viewed from a somewhat different perspective, the unequal value of commodities exchanged reflects the fragile position of the region within the larger international trading system. As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'European trading influence spread much more quickly and more widely than missionary influence in the first half of the nineteenth century. This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': ""market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in Africa was the ideological reflection of her worldwide hegemony, of those 'halcyon days' in which Britain's manufactures outcompeted those of all her rivals and her navy could enforce 'a freedom of access to the markets of the world unparalleled before or since.'$^{48}$ Britain's traders triumphed over all their competitors: over the Boers in southern Africa,$^{49}$ over the African merchants in West Africa,$^{50}$ over the French. 51 second partner in Atlantic trade, the African, if he did not play a decisive role, was nonetheless an actor in it, adapted himself, and extracted profit from the market, in short, behaved like a responsible party in the affair.'"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Agricultural systems', 'content': 'of production and unit of land holding. But, however remote and enclosed, the household even in Bunafu was not self-sufficient. Within two generations, there developed a network of social and cultural relation› ships through which goods and services circulated with remarkable efficiency. New migrants like the mukama Womunafu and his entourage brought a stock of goods, skills and new technologies; the demand for specialized goods like ironware, especially farming implements, pottery and salt led to occasional fairs to which people brought their surplus produce such as barkcloth, skins and live animals in exchange; others took their produce to the locations of known specialist craftsmen like blacksmiths, fishermen and potters. Similarly, goods and services circulated through payments for rituals and worship, or in payment of bride price and other social dues, and even in raiding, stealing and kidnapping. As Cohen has put it, his study \'offers a series of images of a regional economy of the unadministered zone in the early nineteenth century structured not upon the ""channeled effect"" associated with international and interregional trade but structured, rather, upon a remarkably extensive and thickly knit network of circulation, distribution and redistribution."" 9 The nineteenth century brought changes, new pressures and oppor› tunities even for the people in Bunafu, as in other places. As the family expanded, land hitherto regarded as marginal began to be cultivated. New crops hitherto regarded with caution were experimented with and some became new staples. The \'economic horizon\' of the villagers expanded as the trame strengthened the links that stretched from the villages to the coastal ports and overseas markets. Expansion of trade brought social and political changes. Initially, it tended to strengthen the position of chiefs who found it easier to accumulate wealth from taxing trade in salt, iron and copper, not to mention ivory, beeswax and palm oil, than from tribute in agricultural produce and customary labour. At the same time the profits of trade could not be so easily monopolized. Several individuals moved away from their customary locations to seek their fortunes, and social mobility was thus facilitated. But these changes were slow and represented not so much innovation as expansion of tendencies and patterns already evident by the eighteenth century. Thus the causal effect of the external trade should not be exaggerated. As J. L.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards. In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850. In 1895 trade by way of the TripoliBorno route suffered from the operations conducted by Rabeh, and the disruptions caused mainly by the French conquests in West Africa had their repercussions.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier. Dahomey continued with the slave trade for as long as there were customers."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life. Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area. This production at first co-existed with the slave trade,$^{14}$ and later flourished on its own, until the boom came to an end in 1861, and finally declined at the end of the century.$^{15}$ The palm-oil trade similarly expanded in the Gold He finds the relevant consideration to be Europe's need of raw materials and points out the 'extraordinary demands on production' involved in the new amounts of palm oil, timber, and rubber exported.

As J. L. Vellut has emphasized, the nineteenth century was not just 'the history of the ebb and flow of the world economy as experienced by ... Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'. He fed, clothed and met social obligations of members; he determined the size of land and the type of crops to be cultivated each year; how much time to spend on the collective household farm (gandu; plur., gandaye), and how much on"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""As long as Africa was 'outside' the world-economy, the 'cost' of a slave to the slave-owner was the expense of procurement plus maintenance plus supervision (prorated for his/her life as a slave) divided by total work output during his/her life as a slave. The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy. The first long economic and geographic expan› sion of the capitalist world-economy had occurred between 1450 and 160050. In that period, no part of Africa could be said to have been part of this historical system. The period 1600/50-1730/50 was, for the capitalist worldeconomy, a period of relative stagnation, of taking a breath, of consolidation, primarily within the geographic zones that had already been included in the sixteenth century. It was still largely true at this time that no part of Africa could be said to have been incorporated into this system (with the reservations noted about the changing structure of the slave trade). 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""The coast had always exported palm oil, but in minute quantities. Imports into Britain rose from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21 000 tonnes in 1844, levelled off for ten years or so, and then doubled by 1870. France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'African reactions', 'content': 'placement of 1000 000 metric tonnes.

This is brought down from the interior, and retains a large proportion of the fat or gelatine, from the fact, probably, that it is from the recently living animals. In this state it is called green ivory. It is not so white as the kinds called white ivory, which have been lying a longer time exposed to the heat of the sun until the animal matter has disappeared. The excellence of green ivory consists in its greater toughness and in its growing whiter by age, instead of yellow, as is the case with the whiter varieties. Yet buyers of cutlery, through ignorance of these qualities, usually prefer the whiter kinds, which on that account are more in demand for the Sheffield trade, and have more than doubled in price since 1879.\n\nThe sales of ivory occur every three months at London and Liverpool, and sales are also held at irregular intervals at Rotterdam. At Liverpool, only ivory of the best quality is offered. Buyers from Germany and France and agents of American consumers attend these sales; and it is estimated that about one quarter of the whole amount goes to Sheffield, another quarter to London, and the other half to Germany, France, and the United States. There is just now great anxiety as to the future supply of ivory. The stocks in public warehouses are smaller than for many years past, and the rapid increase in prices is causing great anxiety to manufacturers. At a recent sale at Liverpool, the best African ivory sold by the ton at over 12s. 6d. per pound. This will explain the fact that the principal factor in the value of the best table cutlery is the handle. When the ivory comes into the hands of the cutler, much skill is required to make the most of the material, and every scrap is turned to account. After cutting out the scales of all sizes for pocket-knives, and the solid handles for table cutlery, the small pieces are usually sold to the button-makers, or may be made into pearls. These latter are the small pieces of ivory, pearl, or horn inserted into the handles of tea and coffee pots as non-conductors of heat, and are so called because they were originally made of pearl. The fine sawdust is sold for fertilising purposes, for the manufacture of gelatine, and for making a sizing used in the manufacture of lace fabrics. The refuse still remaining goes to the makers of ivory black. The proportion of this residuum is about fifteen pounds to the hundredweight, and sells at from £16 to £20 per ton. Many efforts have been made to devise some method for the solidification of ivory dust, but as yet without success. Great skill is required in the cutting of ivory, as of wood, to bring out the beauty of the grain.'}, {'id': 5961, 'article_title': 'Produce Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Produce Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_02_1890', 'content': '**PALM OIL.**—A moderate business concluded, prices for the week showing a decline of about 5s. per ton in most instances. 500 tons sold; Benin at £21, soft oils at £21 10s., and Lagos at £23 5s., with Irregular at £20 per ton.\n\n---\n\n**LIVERPOOL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 17.**\n\n**SUGAR.**—There has been a fair amount of business done throughout the week, and prices of medium and fine descriptions show an improvement of 3d. per cwt., whilst low qualities are unchanged.\n\n**RUM** is very steady, and 80 puncheons of Demerara sold at previous prices.\n\n**COFFEE.**—There has been a quiet, steady market, and quotations are unchanged. 310 bags African, bold berry, on the spot, and 350 bags, to arrive, at 75s. 6d., 50 bags Jeremie at 87s., and 290 bags Bahia at 77s. 6d. per cwt.\n\n**COCOA.**—There has been a little more doing at steady prices, and 120 bags African sold at 50s. to 55s., and 230 bags Jeremie at 39s. to 40s. per cwt.\n\n**MANDIOCA FLOUR.**—133 bags African at 9s. 3d. per cwt., ex quay.\n\n**GUM.**—About 15 tons Brazilian sold, part at 27s. 6d. per cwt., and small sales of Senegal at steady prices, with 12 bags Lagos Copal at 26s. to 30s. per cwt.\n\n**INDIA-RUBBER.**—Para quiet and unchanged; about 25 tons African sold at 11½d. to 1s. 8d. per lb.\n\n**PALM KERNELS.**—About 2,000 bags sold at £8 to £11 2s. 6d. per ton.\n\n**PALM OIL.**—There has been more pressure to sell, and a further decline of 10s. accepted, at which about 1,000 tons have changed hands; hard oils at £20 5s. to £20, soft oils at £21 5s. to £21, and Lagos at £23 to £22 15s. per ton.\n\n---\n\n**LIVERPOOL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 24.**\n\n**SUGAR.**—The market has been quiet throughout the week, and only a moderate business done, without quotable change in prices.\n\n**COFFEE.**—A moderate business concluded at very steady prices, the sales including 257 bags African, bold berry at 75s. 6d. to 76s., with small sales of Elephant berry at 86s. per cwt.\n\n**COCOA.**—There has been more business doing at very steady prices, and 550 bags fermented Bahia sold at 60s. to 61s., 213 bags African at 42s. to 60s., and 400 bags Jeremie at 39s. to 40s. per cwt.\n\n**INDIA-RUBBER.**—The market for Para is dull and easier.

Yet we find that the ivory trade with the Congo Free State continues to steadily increase. This ivory comes from the Higher Congo, both north and south of the river. Steamers bring it as far as Stanley Pool, and from there to Matadi, 250 miles, Native carriers—mostly if not invariably slaves—bring it on their backs. An eye-witness lately reported that he had seen in one day 500 carriers go into Matadi, each carrying a tusk 65lb. in weight. When tusks weigh 200lb, which not infrequently happens, four men carry them. Most of the ivory now coming down is known as ""dead ivory."" Some of the elephants from which these tusks came were killed a century ago, and the Kings of villages have been storing it, placing the last tusks brought in on the top of the pile, and when they required some goods from the coast traders the tusks from the bottom layers were taken. This system has prevailed for many years, and it is estimated that there is yet enough ivory stored up in this manner in the interior of Africa to supply the world\'s demands for the next century. A State expedition visited a Native King some time ago in the interior. Upon leaving, the commanding officer presented the King with a uniform coat, cocked hat, and a sword. The King in return presented the officer with 150 tusks of ivory, averaging 220lb. each, and provided carriers to take them down to the river. These people do not recognise the value, and laugh at the trader for buying. Some of the Native Kings are said to have stockades of ivory built around their dwellings. It is estimated that there are still at least 200,000 elephants in Central Africa. The only ""live,"" or new, ivory which now comes down is that procured by hunters attached to the different trading-houses. Live ivory commands a better price than the dead.\n\nMany travellers and explorers in the Dark Continent have not scrupled to say that as long as the trade in ivory continues to be one of the staple industries of Central Africa, so long it will be impossible to put down the slave trade. But we may well hope that with the opening up of the Interior country, and its firm administration by the principal European Powers, the days of that abominable traffic are doomed; while ivory will long continue to be almost a necessity of civilised life.'}, {'id': 6755, 'article_title': 'Produce Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Produce Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1896#article-21', 'issue_date': '01_05_1896', 'content': ""**COCOA.**—The market continues very quiet, the trade still showing little disposition to operate, and only a small business is understood to have been done, without any material change to notice in values.

Or, license duty at 4 frs.; export duty at 2 frs.; total, 6 frs., or about 26⅓ per cent.\n\nWho will not call such duties exorbitant?\n\nThis becomes the more apparent, as ivory is very divergent in value, regulating itself according to the weight of each tusk.\n\nThe tusks weighing over 20 lbs. English, are generally the dearest, then follow those of from 10 to 20 lbs., whilst the cheapest are less than 10 lbs.\n\nDuring the last two years we sold in eight successive sales in London: Tusks of over 20 lbs. English, from 30 frs. to 23 frs. per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram is 13½ to 17½ per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram is 20 to 26 per cent. Tusks from 10 to 20 lbs. English 27,75 frs. to 21,74 frs. per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram is 14⅓ to 18⅓ per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram is 21⅓ to 27⅓ per cent. Tusks below 10 lbs. English 19,75 frs. to 10,80 per kilogram; on this a duty of 4 frs. per kilogram, is 20 to 37 per cent.; on this a duty of 6 frs. per kilogram, is 30 to 55½ per cent.\n\nIt requires no argument to prove that, with such burdens, the ivory trade is impracticable to the Congo trader. The buying is done in small lots at a time. He who purchases a lot of small ivory is by no means sure of securing large ivory later on. The negro will no longer be able to barter the article for goods.

But with the increased consumption of that article elephants are being exterminated, and have to be sought far away in the interior to the west of Tanganyika and northwest of Victoria Nyanza. The chief trading centre in the interior is Tabara, in Myamwesi, where various caravan routes meet. The practice at present is for traders to equip a caravan in Zanzibar, and place it in charge of a trustworthy Arab, who takes it from Bagamoyo, opposite Zanzibar, to Tabara. If he finds enough ivory there, he exchanges goods which he has brought for the purpose, and starts on the return journey; but, as a rule, the caravan has to go further, and by the information he receives from returning caravans the conductor judges where he can go with most chance of speedy success.\n\nLarge quantities of ivory are usually in the hands of native chiefs, with whom it is a kind of treasure, and sometimes, it is said, the Arab conductors, who are usually accompanied by well-armed escorts, will make war on a chief, seize his ivory, and sell his people into slavery. If force cannot be used, the trader must patiently purchase small quantities from time to time as occasion arises, and sometimes he is forced to wait for years in the interior before he can part with all his merchandise and obtain his loads of ivory. The greater part of the ivory arrives in Zanzibar in July and August; the Indian merchants go to Bagamoyo to meet their conductors, and then a settlement takes place. The cost of the caravan, with 15 per cent. per annum, is charged to the Arab, the Indian takes the ivory, sells it on account of the Arab, and pays the latter the balance. Arrived in Zanzibar, the ivory is either sent by the Indian merchants direct to Bombay or to London, or it is sold to Hamburg or American merchants on the spot.\n\nThe trade is wholly in the hands of Indian merchants; but the advantage of having agents of the European merchants in Tabara to purchase ivory systematically and forward it to the coast has been discussed in Zanzibar, and one Hamburg firm there decided to try it. A caravan under two Germans was despatched to Tabara, where one was to remain to establish a branch, while the other pushed on to Uganda, so as to be able to purchase at first hand. One died soon afterwards, and the other fell ill and was forced to return.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE IVORY TRADE OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The saw of the cutter occasionally reveals a rifle-ball that has been lodged in the tusk, and that has been completely covered over by subsequent growth. About one-third of the length of the tusk, where it enters the head of the elephant, is hollow. This hollow, when the tusk is in place upon the live animal, is filled with a soft pulp or core, which supplies the growth of the tusk. A ball lodged in this core will in time be imbedded in the solid ivory. This hollow portion is cut off and sold separately, except the thinnest portion, as bangle rings for the ankles and arms of Indian and African women. That portion of the tusk towards the point is usually more solid and of finer grain. This is cut off and sold by itself at high prices under the name of billiard-ball points. Small teeth, of from ten to fifteen pounds weight, are called in the trade ""scrivelloes."" The points of these small tusks are used in their natural state for making handles for expensive carving sets and for other articles of luxury. The large proportion of very small tusks which are now brought to market annually is a sure indication of the increasing number of elephants that die young. To show to what size these tusks might attain, the American Consul states that there was in a Sheffield showroom an African elephant\'s tusk nine feet long, twenty-one inches in girth, and weighing one hundred and sixty pounds. The value of the tusk was £130, and it is said that an animal large enough and strong enough to carry such a pair would attract far more attention than Jumbo did.\n\nIn the nine years which ended with 1881, there were 5,286 tons of ivory imported into Great Britain, and, as the number of tusks is known, the average weight of pairs of tusks can be ascertained. It is a little under forty pounds each pair. These imports represent 296,016 pairs, and consequently the same number of elephants have either died long ago, or have been recently slaughtered, to supply the demands of luxury in nine years alone. At this rate of destruction it will be seen how rapidly the elephant must disappear, and how surely ivory will become a thing of the past. There are, doubtless, large quantities of ivory still remaining in the interior of the African continent; but, with the rapid advance of civilized man, and the temptations of increasing high prices, these will soon be discovered and exhausted.—*Chambers\'s Journal.*', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared.

The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'PRODUCE MARKETS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'SUGAR.—There has been a strong market, with a good demand both from the trade and exporters, and a large business done, prices of good medium and fine qualities being 3d. to 6d. dearer, whilst low kinds show an improvement of 1¼d. per cwt.\n\nRUM.—No transactions to notice.\n\nCOFFEE.—The market has been very firm, with a good demand, and prices show an advance of fully 2s. per cwt. 400 bags African, on the spot and to arrive, sold at 56s. to 57s., 160 bags Ceara at 65s., and 1,090 bags Hayti, Jeremie at 63s., Jacmel at 64s. 6d. to 67s., and St. Marc and Gonaives at 67s. per cwt.\n\nCOCOA.—The business has been only of a retail character at about late rates, and 76 bags Jeremie sold at 44s. to 45s., 40 bags Para at 55s., with sales of African at 56s. per cwt.\n\nRICE.—The market has been firm, but rather inactive.\n\nGINGER.—We are without any business to report, beyond small sales of African at 16s. per cwt.\n\nGUINEA GRAINS.—10 bags at 25s. 6d. per cwt.\n\nGUM.—There is a moderate demand for various qualities, with small sales of Egyptian Amrad at full rates, of Ghezirah sifting at 73s., and 30 bags Hog Tragacanth at £14 per cwt.\n\nINDIA-RUBBER.—Market quiet, and without change in prices.\n\nMYRABOLAMS.—1,600 bags sold at 4s. 6d. to 8s. 6d. per cwt.\n\nLOGWOOD is in fair demand at full prices; 80 tons good Honduras, lying at Goole, sold at £7 17s. 6d. per ton.\n\nFUSTIC.—Moderate sales at late rates.\n\nEBONY.—30 tons Opobo at £5 to £5 2s. 6d. per ton.\n\nLIMAWOOD.—Further sales at steady values.\n\nCAMWOOD.—8 tons at £11 5s. to £15 12s. 6d. per ton, ex quay.\n\nPALM KERNELS very firm, and 5,020 bags sold at £8 10s. to £10 10s. per ton.\n\nPALM OIL.—The market has become quiet, and, to effect sales, a decline of 5s. to 10s. per ton has had to be submitted to.

It is somewhat remarkable, however, as showing the nature of the demand which has arisen for ostrich feathers, that, as compared with ten years ago, the price has only fallen for the superior kinds of feathers, while in some kinds of inferior descriptions it is, notwithstanding the enormously enhanced supply, actually higher than it was ten years back. I have been obligingly supplied by one of the leading brokers of London with a list of quotations, and the results are curious. Ostrich feathers are divided into twenty-two grades or qualities. Of these, four, including all the most valuable kinds, have fallen very considerably in value as compared with the quotations of ten years ago.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': 'The export sector was basically concerned with the production of primary products - agricultural products and minerals. With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers. The family was the basic unit of production. It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock.

This is the extent to which it is misleading to persist in describing African agricultural systems as 'subsistence', or sustaining 'natural economies'. These terms were initially justified on the mistaken notion that African rural communities were static, 'tribal', 'selfcontained' or 'almost self-contained.'$^{15}$ As empirical evidence has been gathered to disprove this view of isolated communities, it appears that some protagonists of the view that African agriculture had a subsistence character, while conceding the prevalence of the circulation of goods and services, are now defining subsistence in ideological terms. They claim that African farmers were subsistence farmers, not peasants, on the grounds that though they might have bought and sold, their predominant motive was not profit. They define peasants as 'small agricultural producers who intend to make a living by selling part of their crops and herds', and they consider that peasantization is necessarily the result of 'the impact of new markets' and the profit motive.$^{16}$ What the Tunisian experience highlights is that African agricultural systems in the early nineteenth century were such that the different communities could not be regarded as self-contained. There was a variety of crops according to the variety of soils, family traditions and individual preferences and specialized skills. Crop farming, crafts and animal husbandry went together in a variety of patterns that encouraged exchange as the means by which families made up their essential needs. Each family gave up part of its surplus in return for what it needed but did not produce, and saved the remainder of its produce for years of drought and other calamities."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': ""Furthermore, Africans were forbidden to grow certain crops. In Kenya, for instance, Africans were forbidden to grow coffee, 'by far the most lucrative cash crop' in the country.$^{41}$ It was not until the 1950s that this European monopoly was shattered by Mau Mau.\nThe main result of all these steps was the proletarianization of the African peasantry, which appears to have taken place on a larger scale in Southern Rhodesia than in the other countries under discussion.$^{42}$ Thus African labour employed by Europeans at starvation wages produced cash crops for both the home market and for export. In Kenya, by 1927, between 83700 and 117 000 Africans, or more than 50% of total wage labour, worked in commercial agriculture. The leading crops were maize, coffee, wheat and sisal. Maize occupied only 325 ha in 1905; by 1920 it occupied nearly 12500 ha, and nine years later the area had risen to over 90000 ha.$^{43}$ By the early 1920s the settlers had ousted African peasants from the production and trade of this important staple. The area under coffee also recorded a dramatic expansion, rising from 32 ha in 1905, reaching over 11250 ha in 1920, and shooting up to nearly 39000 ha ten years later.$^{44}$ In 1913 coffee and maize exports earned the country £64991; in 1920 export of these two crops and sisal earned £566556 and their value reached £2429655 in 1930, with coffee accounting for more than 50%.$^{4S}$ These developments led to significant structural changes. In 1913, the exclusive African sector contributed 24% of the value of total domestic exports while the exclusive European sector contributed only 5%. Evidently by this time, African labour had made little impact on commercial agriculture. By 1932 the contribution of African areas had dropped to 9% while that of European areas had risen to 76%.$^{46}$ A dominant feature of the economy in colonial Kenya was established."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""The role of the European commercial firms has been assessed by many scholars, most of whom agree on the significance of connecting Africa with markets in Western Europe and the Americas.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Minerals', 'content': 'The export sectors of the countries under discussion had two major characteristics.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded.

Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones.

In Rwanda and Burundi the major staples are in order of importance beans, sweet potatoes, cassava and potatoes."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels', 'content': ""The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend. Silks and carpets from Turkey and Tripoli, natron from Borno, and Hausa textiles, were exchanged for kola nuts, gold, cotton materials from Dagomba, Mossi and Mande, shea butter and livestock from the Sudanese Sahel."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""The traditional compartmentalization between largely non-com› mercialized agricultural production and the long-distance trade in nonagricultural (luxury) products remained the rule even in those cases where there were small European agricultural settler communities, such as the prazeros in the Zambezi valley or the Boers on the Cape coast.\nThe one zone in which the economic situation was somewhat different was those parts of West and Central Africa where communities had begun to participate in the slave trade. The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour.

She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed.

These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The data for Lagos are for 1862.

In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture. The enormous number of silk-cotton trees in the colony would yield a plentiful supply if the people found it worth collecting and exporting, and the timber is used for making fishing canoes.\n\nRice also might be made an important crop on the Gold Coast.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.742, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'With the effective end of the Atlantic slave trade and the increased demand for gold, palm oil, palm kernels and peanuts from western Africa, sugar cane from Mauritius, RØunion and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean, as well as ivory and cloves from East and Central Africa, there was an increased demand for captives not only to produce these goods, but also to transport them by headload or by canoes down to the coast. Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object.

Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas.

And in proportion as the general exchange of productions progresses among the nations under the influence of free trade, such changes will undoubtedly become more frequent. That they are instruments in the world's advancement, is undeniable. We alluded last month to the impulse given to the search for available fibre, consequent upon the failure of the cotton supply from America, and of the influence fibre might exercise in the great work of African industrial regeneration. It is scarcely necessary to say here that we believe in that regeneration. And feeble as the evidences of its approach may seem to the world at large, we think we see in them a strength that nothing can long impede or overcome. Yes, Africa must emerge from her Pagan superstition, her wars and atrocities, her industrial apathy and inertia. Looking at her in relation with the rest of the world some ten years since, the prospect was gloomy enough; the day of her emerging seemed indefinitely postponed. This was only because we could not see what was in the womb of time. Those ten years, a brief space in the world's history, have been mighty in the agencies which they have organised for African advancement. The inscrutable mind and Almighty hand of Divine Providence have been at work among the nations for the good of Africa! And we shrink into self-acknowledged nothingness as we think of how little we comprehended the signs of the times, and the extent of influence which discoveries and events were preparing for mankind.\n\nThe great substitute for the slave-trade on the West Coast of Africa, south of the River Gambia, has been the trade in palm oil. Palm oil has become the great staple of Western Africa. Taking into account the difficulty of access to the interior, and the manners and habits of the people, it must be admitted that the trade in this useful article has had an extraordinary development. Palm oil was precisely such an article as the barbarous inhabitants of a tropical climate needed to possess in the infancy of their commerce. The tree which produces the palm-oil nut is the most valuable of all trees to the native African. It grows spontaneously over large tracts of country. It furnishes him with oil, wine, vinegar, thatch, fibre, and fuel. Accustomed themselves to the free use of palm oil, the Africans had only to prepare a larger quantity from fruit ready to their hands, for which they had neither to till or sow.""}, {'id': 224, 'article_title': 'LAGOS, SEPT. 9.', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS, SEPT. 9.', 'last_edit_date': '09-09-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1863#article-12', 'issue_date': '23_10_1863', 'content': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nSir,—You have spoken in several numbers of your valuable paper of the reoccupation of the Fort of Quittah as a fact, or as being about to become a fact within a short time. I beg, however, to inform you hereby, that up to this day it has not been reoccupied, and it seems Her Majesty\'s Government does not think of doing so. I heard his Excellency the Governor has expressed his opinion in this wise—viz., that his force, not being strong enough to avenge any insult done to the British flag on the part of the natives, he would rather not occupy the fort at all.\n\nIn the meantime, we are left to our fate—i.e., to do as well as we can without a Government, and we manage it pretty well, except the slave-trade. This is going on in a splendid style. The country is full of money—American doubloons, twenty-dollar gold pieces, &c.—which is, no doubt, money that has been paid for slaves. People who formerly traded in palm oil now buy slaves, and every petty trader invests his little money in this more profitable trade. The slaves coming from the interior by the River Volta are sent down to Popo and Ahguay; and the people of the latter places also send money here to the traders to buy slaves for them. The other day I heard of a native (a palm-oil trader at Addah) to whom 500 dollars had been sent by a gentleman of Popo to buy ten slaves for him. There being such a good market for slaves at Popo and Ahguay, I suppose there must be many more vessels making their escape than is asserted by officers of Her Majesty\'s men of war; and all this in spite of the new treaty with the United States of America.\n\nBeing a witness of this every day, you will find it natural that I am sorry that Her Majesty\'s Government does not take any measures to prevent this trade, which is surely the ruin of the country, and which might be done away with by the reoccupation of the Fort of Quittah. Of course the reoccupation must be with a commandant who would not betray his duty to a slave-dealer for a few good dinners. Before the fort was abandoned we had little or no slave-trade.

He is paying fifty dollars per head. It is nonsense to say that slaves are not shipped from Popo and Ahguay. The men and women are neither bought to be eaten, nor to be employed on the Coast, but for shipment to Cuba; and that they find their way there is certain.

It is well known that the rivers from which palm oil is now exported, to the value of 1,500,000l. per annum, were once the head-quarters of the slave-trade. The palm-oil trade, wherever established on the coast, has driven out the slave-trade. Precisely the same effect will follow when legitimate commerce has been established in the interior; by thus counteracting the slave-trade at its chief source a saving will, ere long, be effected on the West Coast squadron, in comparison with which the subsidy applied for must appear trifling.'}, {'id': 639, 'article_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.'}, {'id': 5459, 'article_title': 'Trading Troubles in Western Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Trading Troubles in Western Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'issue_date': '01_12_1886', 'content': 'To a palaver on board his gunboat all the chiefs were recently summoned by the English Consul, who said he regretted deeply to see the state into which the country had fallen, the want of unity that existed amongst the chiefs and people, and the general lawlessness that prevailed. He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.'}, {'id': 5841, 'article_title': 'PRODUCE MARKETS', 'full_section_title': 'PRODUCE MARKETS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_05_1889#article-15', 'issue_date': '06_05_1889', 'content': '**PALM OIL.**—The market has been quiet, and a further decline of about 10s. accepted.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The natives of these oil-exporting towns go up with their slaves to the interior, carrying manufactured goods, gunpowder, rum, and other desired commodities, which they there exchange with the interior people for oil, to be brought down by themselves to the coast. They do not allow any intercourse of those interior producing people with the European merchants and traders, but reserve to themselves the entire monopoly of transactions with them. They have systematically opposed every effort of the European or even educated African merchant and trader to establish commercial or other relations with the interior. They seal this up, as it were, from the intrusion of civilization and Christianity, in order that they may preserve their monopoly of trade. In the same way that, previous to 1835, they monopolized the supply of slaves to the ships of the odious foreign slavetraders, so do they now monopolize all trade relations with the interior.

For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Rubber, palm kernels, palm oil, and benni seed (an oil-producing substance) constitute the bulk of the exports of Sierra Leone. The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour.

In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487.

In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Parcel Post with the Oil Rivers Protectorate', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""It is evident that in a trade which has its foundation on the barter system the value and quantity of the imports must vary directly with the exports.

Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods.

In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

The average prices in Europe of the more important native products have stood even lower than during the previous twelve months, while the prolonged continuance of low prices in Africa has apparently disheartened the native producer, and tended to diminish the quantity as well as the value of his out-turn. In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos.

Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco.

It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.729, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
295,The volatility in African cotton prices and demand underscores the significant impact of global market dynamics on African economies and agricultural exports.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant impact of global market dynamics on African economies and agricultural exports, particularly cotton. The General History of Africa highlights the sensitivity of African economies to international trade conditions due to their monocrop nature, with cotton being a crucial cash crop in regions like Sudan and Uganda. Historical events such as the Great Depression and the World Wars caused economic disruptions, leading to depressed prices for Africa's primary products, including cotton. The colonial control over prices often did not reflect increased demand, and the export of unprocessed agricultural products resulted in low-value exports, further exposing African economies to global market fluctuations. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide contemporary evidence of volatility in cotton prices and demand, noting fluctuations such as declines and recoveries in prices per pound and varying demand levels. External factors, like Turkish festivals and telegraph advices, influenced market conditions, demonstrating the global market's role in shaping African cotton prices. While the articles focus on price and demand changes, they do not explicitly link these to broader economic impacts, unlike the textbook, which emphasizes the vulnerability of African economies to external forces. Together, these sources illustrate the profound influence of global market dynamics on African agricultural exports and economies.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the impact of global market dynamics on African economies and agricultural exports, including cotton.

The volatility in prices and demand for primary products, including cotton, is evident from the economic disruptions caused by global events such as the Great Depression and the World Wars. For instance, the declaration of war led to a depression in prices for Africa's primary products, including cotton, and the colonial governments often controlled prices, which did not always reflect increased demand. Additionally, the text notes that the export sectors left agricultural products unprocessed, resulting in low-value exports, further exposing African economies to global market fluctuations.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'African participation in the colonial economy, 1920-30', 'content': ""distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

The 'traditional' no longer existed as such, with its labour drawn off and its rationale destroyed. Its agricultural production either dropped or failed to keep up with the growth of the population.

As J. L. Vellut has emphasized, the nineteenth century was not just 'the history of the ebb and flow of the world economy as experienced by ... Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'.

Generally there followed a depression in the prices paid for Africa's primary products, while knowledge that henceforth imported goods would be in short supply led to a rise in their prices. In Uganda there was an overnight increase of 50% in the price of imports.$^{48}$ The pattern of African trade with Europe was radically changed by the exclusion of the Germans from the Allied territories, where in certain cases, like Sierra Leone, they had accounted for 80% of the import-export trade. Germany's own colonies, even before they were occupied by the Allies, were cut off from trade with the mØtropole because of Allied dominion over the seas. Germany, from being tropical Africa's major overseas trading partner, was now almost entirely excluded from trading activities in the continent, for once the Allies completed their occupation of the German colonies, all German nationals were interned and their plantations, commercial houses and industries were taken over by the occupying powers. Even in the case of the French African territories, where the French groundnut-milling industry would normally have been able to absorb the oil-seeds hitherto imported by the Germans, it was unable to do so, as it was located in the German-occupied part of north-east France. Thus where France had been the major importer of the Gambian groundnut crop, she was now replaced by Britain whose share of the crop rose from 4% in 1912 to 48% in 191o.$^{49}$ Indeed the dramatic substitution of British for German traders would almost suggest that the war, as far as the African colonies were concerned, was seen by Britain, (like Germany, a free-trade nation) as an opportunity for economic aggrandizement. While generally the excluded German traders were replaced by nationals of the governing power of the colonies in which they had traded, in French West Africa, the British made headway against the French because of the mobilization of French traders. 50 The depression that followed the outbreak of war soon gave way to a boom in those products needed to boost the Allied war effort. Thus Egyptian cotton rose from £E$ a quintal in 1914 to £E8 in 1916-18. 51 But increased demand was not always reflected by increased prices, for often the colonial governments controlled the prices paid to the producers.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

Certain countries suffered badly throughout the war. To take the example of the Gold Coast, its major export crop of cocoa was not nearly in such demand as, for instance, oil-seeds. Furthermore the buying capacity of the African-based import-export houses was severely hampered by the enlistment, voluntary or obligatory, of so many of the European personnel; in French West Africa some 75% of the European traders had left for the war by 1917. 52 While prices of exports did not always reflect the increased demand for them, because of controlled prices, and while demand for labour, too, was not always reflected in increased wages, the prices of imports, where they were obtainable, rose throughout the war. While the vast majority of Africans in the subsistence sector were not affected by this inflation, those in the wage-earning or export crop-producing sectors were. Thus the Egyptian peasant producing cotton found that the benefit he received from increased prices for his product did not offset the steep rise in the cost of fuel, clothing and cereals. 53 The war witnessed an increased level of state intervention in the economies of the African colonies, whether in the form of price control, requisition of food crops, compulsory cultivation of crops, recruitment of labour for essential projects or allocation of shipping space. Generally such intervention tended to favour the import-export houses of the colonial power controlling the colony concerned. Thus in Nigeria, companies like John Holt and the United Africa Company were used as buying agents and had both priority in shipping space and easier access to loans from the banks, with the result that smaller import-export companies, in particular Nigerian-controlled ones, suffered. 54 Demands for traditionally subsistence crops, including yams, manioc and beans, for the feeding of the Allies in Europe and for the armies in Africa or the Middle Eastern front, added to the hardship of those outside the subsistence sector. And where subsistence crops were requisitioned - as they widely were - or paid for at prices below the free-market price, the producers themselves suffered.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""As long as Africa was 'outside' the world-economy, the 'cost' of a slave to the slave-owner was the expense of procurement plus maintenance plus supervision (prorated for his/her life as a slave) divided by total work output during his/her life as a slave. The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy.

One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent.

This was partly because Europeans preferred jurisdiction over areas with which they were already familiar, and partly because pre-colonial foreign trade orientation caused African communities to be more susceptible to colonial economic innovations, such as the cultivation of crops specifically for sale to Europeans. The slaving zones from Senegal to Sierra Leone, from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Nigeria and from the Congo river to Angola were the stretches of coast› line first encroached upon by the European colonizers. In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves. Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland. Indeed, they overestimated the amount of wealth which could be readily made if they penetrated to these sources.

McPhee, Bauer and Hopkins have rightly emphasized the firms' role in expanding the traders' frontier and the cash sector as a whole, but they say very little about the exploitative tendencies of these firms.$^{76}$ Traders - Europeans, Indians, Lebanese, and to a limited extent, Africans - appropriated the surplus generated by peasant production, especially through unequal exchange. They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded.

It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.747, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': 'On the eastern side of the continent, the Indian Ocean trade was not exclusively directed towards European countries, nor was the long-distance trade out of East Africa controlled by Europeans or Afro-Europeans. The colonizers had to supplant the Arab, Swahili and Indian merchants. Experiences in East Africa underscored the premise that colonial activities first centred around parts of Africa which had a prior involvement in inter› continental exchange. The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region. By the mid 1880s, the Scramble was already taking place on Lake Victoria, on whose shores colonial enterprises were quickly grafted on to the already high level of African economic activity. When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form. North African economies were as much part of a Mediterranean complex as they were part of the African trans-Saharan network. Prior experience with the European economy allowed segments of North African society to accommodate to the intensifi› cation of production for Europe and to the spread of European commodities in local markets. But the well-defined and exploitative ruling class was determined to defend state frontiers, even if willing to enter closer economic relations with Europeans. Therefore, colonial rule often advanced while maintaining North Africans in nominal authority, and the colonial economy was institutionalized before the complete subjugation of the indigenous polities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': 'From the late fifteenth century onwards, Africa participated in the Europeoriented world economy as a peripheral and dependent sector. But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area. This production at first co-existed with the slave trade,$^{14}$ and later flourished on its own, until the boom came to an end in 1861, and finally declined at the end of the century.$^{15}$ The palm-oil trade similarly expanded in the Gold He finds the relevant consideration to be Europe's need of raw materials and points out the 'extraordinary demands on production' involved in the new amounts of palm oil, timber, and rubber exported.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.737, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': 'In the 1870s, free trade was the slogan by which Europeans fought against the right of African rulers to regulate trade.$^{23}$ In the name of free trade, they sought more and more privileges for European traders.

They manipulated servicing of the loans to acquire rights to the produce and to customs duties years in advance. They signed one-sided agreements for the collection of debts and enforced these and other privileges of European traders to weaken the economies of the states and even more the control of the rulers over the economy. In Egypt and Tunisia, they forced on the rulers international debt com› missions which greatly undermined the autonomy of the rulers, provoked riots, hindered reform and directly led to the loss of independence with little or no fighting involved.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""GERMANY'S TRADE WITH ITS AFRICAN COLONIES"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The business Germany has been doing with the colonies in Africa shows a pretty considerable increase, as may be seen by the following figures, which were lately published by the Commercial Office in Hamburg, from which place most of the goods are shipped to the colonies.

Going back fifty years ago, to 1836, we find no definite statistics for the Gold Coast; while Gambia exported no less than in 1875—£147,000. The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony. The value of the rubber exported is about £6,000 annually. Nearly three-fourths of the ground nuts exported go to France.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Lagos seems to be the most flourishing of the West African colonies; partly due to its comparatively good harbour, its low tariffs, and the enterprise of its population, a large portion of which are emigrants from Sierra Leone, and a good many from Brazil.

Its export trade with Germany exceeds that with England, the former in 1884 amounting to £283,700 and the latter to £249,700. England, however, sent £338,000 worth of imports to £151,000 worth from Germany. The value of the kernels exported in 1884 was £327,346, and of palm oil £225,557, the two together forming about five-sixths of the entire exports.

One of the speakers suggested that as trade appears to be suffering from the fact that production exceeds consumption, it would be a good thing if capital was more systematically devoted to the work of distribution. We must conclude that some impulse to the distribution of wealth is needed; and a wider distribution of mercantile profits would doubtless be a consequence of the application of the joint-stock principle to mercantile enterprise.\n\nThere is a well-founded belief that the economic development of Africa will be a work of time, and that it is not at all likely to advance by ""leaps and bounds."" The fact is, that so far as the West Coast is concerned, experienced authorities have pointed out that the black man must be interested in cultivation if trade is to be permanent and African communities are to become large consumers of European manufactures. At the present rate of indiscriminate collection, the supplies of ivory must eventually be exhausted, the India-rubber and other plants be destroyed, and the whole country be converted into a waste. It is upon the interior that the interest of the trading and investing public is concentrated, because it is the region of untried possibilities. But the prudent ask whether, assuming the existence of vast stores of produce and favourable conditions of development and progress, markets can be found at paying prices for the produce which Central Africa may yield. It is a question of cost as well as of productiveness. African rivers are interrupted by cataracts from which the great rivers of other continents still only partially developed are free. It is true that the construction of railways is hinted at, but questions arise as to what will be the cost of such railways, who will provide the capital, how long before they become remunerative, and how many transhipments will be required; for it is conceivable that the mere cost of transporting produce to the consuming markets might prove greater than the price obtainable for them.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Decade of the Trade of Hamburg with West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'An interesting report from the British Consul-General at Hamburg on the growth of the trade of that port with the West Coast of Africa during the past ten years has lately been issued. The main features of this increase are the establishment of direct and regular steam communication, a fourfold increase in the shipping, an increase in imports of more than sixfold, while exports have doubled.\n\nIn the imports of Hamburg the West Coast of Africa now ranks fifth, and in exports fourth. First, as to shipping—in 1878, 25 vessels, of which 10 were German, with a total tonnage of 8,054 tons, arrived in Hamburg from the West Coast, and 98 vessels, of which 48 were German, of 25,674 tons left Hamburg, and none were steamers. In 1888 there were 63 vessels inwards, 34 being German, of a gross tonnage of 67,446 tons, and 89 outwards, 59 being German, of a gross tonnage of 72,885 tons. Of the inward vessels 54, and of the outward 59 were steamers. Thus in ten years the tonnage increased by about 400 per cent. Imports have increased far more than exports, because Hamburg has now become the centre of distribution for West African products.\n\nThe chief article of import is palm kernels, of which there were 973,405 cwts. in 1888, against 106,453 cwts. in 1878; in palm oil the quantities for the same years were 121,884 cwts. and 29,036 cwts., respectively; coffee, 11,109 cwts. and 96 cwts.; dyewood, 20,668 cwts. and 6,094 cwts.; india-rubber, 13,679 cwts. and 3,142 cwts.; and so on for less important articles. The total imports for 1888 amounted to 1,168,783 cwts., and the exports 1,121,605 cwts.; in 1878 the imports were 182,399 cwts., and the exports 495,660 cwts. The chief article of export is alcohol in one or other of its forms. The export of spirits in 1888 was 652,130 cwts., against 314,120 cwts. in 1878; the exports of the other principal articles for the two years were as follows: Rice, 90,778 cwts. in 1888 and 5,053 in 1878; beer, 16,479 and 2,919 cwts.; gunpowder, 86,320 and 10,844 cwts.; iron ware, 20,478 and 4,559 cwts.; tobacco, 12,048 and 2,784 cwts.; cotton goods, 11,053 and 3,110 cwts. In the non-European trade of Hamburg, West Africa comes sixth in imports, before Mexico, Singapore, Japan, China, &c., and next after British India. Indeed, it is nearly equal to the latter, which includes considerable imports of jute and rice. In exports the West Coast is fourth, coming next after the Argentine Republic.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers.

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL INTERESTS IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""commerce if carried by steamers. The demand for kola nuts was reported to be at all times considerable in Brazil, but in view of the slowness of the passage and the difficulty of keeping them in marketable condition, the value has at no time during the past six years exceeded £3,563, while in 1877 it sank as low as £304. Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos.

Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following communication has been sent to us.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy.

The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded.

Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': '1 New trends in the Maghrib: Algeria, Tunisia and Libya', 'section_title': 'The trans-Saharan trade', 'content': 'The trans-Saharan trade was still flourishing at the beginning of the nineteenth century, both in the west (from Timbuktu to Tafilälet and from Goulimime to Taodeni) and in the centre (from Tunis and Tripoli to Ghadämes), and Sudanese exports still consisted ofslaves and gold. Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno.

The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards.

Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

It was difficult to make them understand the quantity of a pound weight and the proportion of a pound they brought for sale, so as to regulate the price in cowries, according to their current value. Their aim was to get as much as they could, especially as they imagined that I must be very anxious to get cotton. Having failed to begin with cowries, as almost all want cloths or fents, which they called handkerchiefs, in exchange for cotton, and having a small quantity of fents to spare, I ordered some to be weighed out and bartered for cotton: which was then readily sold for fents, from the lengths of half-a-yard to a yard or two, according to the quantity of cotton bought. In four days we bought 80lbs. clean cotton, ready to be packed for shipment. I could spare no more fents for this purpose. On the 13th a large quantity of cotton, both clean and in seeds, was brought into the yard, but as they still held out and called for alfuta (handkerchiefs or fents), instead of cowries, very little was bought: they would not believe that I had no more fents to spare in this way, and a whole piece of cloth was too much to make such a beginning with. By being paid in fents for barter, they got double advantages, profit on cotton sold to us, and profit on cloth received in barter when sold. I told them that if they would grow a large quantity of cotton, that merchants would come here with large ships and plenty of goods to purchase every bit of cotton they could produce; but they were eager that I should buy what they had in hand first, which of course I could not do, not having the means of doing so.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony.

Among many other places, our steamer, the ""Kinsembo,"" touched at Duke Town, Old Calabar river. Duke Town and Creek Town, close by it, are situated about forty miles up the sea. Here I found that about 500 tons of palm oil were shipped every week, besides palm kernels, rubber, ebony, and other products of Africa. Now, Old Calabar is an exact reproduction of the Upper Congo in scenery and the character of its vegetation. From Bolobo to Stanley Falls, and up the Lunlungu, Ikelemba, Itimbiri, Lubilash, M\'bura, Arnrurimi, and M\'bungu rivers, the islands and mainland are covered with the oil-palm and rubber trees. Forests are draped with the orchilla weed; the gum-copal is so abundant that tons may be found among the boulders of the Cataract region, which have been washed down from the Upper Congo; the natives know where the largest deposits are to be found. This length of navigation, which has similar features to Old Calabar, is just twenty times the length of river that, in the Bight of Benin, contributes 500 tons of palm oil weekly. When developed to the same extent, this would furnish 10,000 tons weekly. We have also to reckon the ivory, no mean article of commerce, that could be collected from an area of 500,000 square miles, without risk; and also the ground-nuts, or their oil, which could be produced from the area of the Cataract region, where this plant is most in cultivation, besides valuable minerals. We have not reckoned the food products which could be exported within two years from the opening of the railway. In a comparatively brief time steamers departing daily from the mouth of the Congo could not convey the produce of the river and its immediate banks, provided always that the railways were adequate to transport the produce from the Pool. Without a railway it is lost time to dwell upon the products of that extensive region under consideration, as the whole of it is not worth a thought. Given a railway, and given that every enterprising soul is stimulated to carry on his business or industry on the banks of the river, assured that his communications are as easy as though settled at Sierra Leone, and that the Government which supervises him and his surroundings is generous and liberal, like that which the International Association is disposed to be, the conception of the future importance and value of this region to the markets of the world need be no great strain on the imagination.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMANDER CAMERON AGAIN ON CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At a quarter past 12 a crowded audience assembled in the small Concert-room to hear an address from Commander Cameron, R.N., the distinguished African traveller, on ""Trade with Central Africa."" Mr. Shaw Lefevre, M.P., presided, and briefly introduced the speaker. Commander Cameron said that the trade of Central Africa is now virtually confined to two things—ivory and slaves; and, owing to the difficulties of transit, the whole of the ivory is carried to the coast by porters. Owing to this, the Arab traders and others were compelled to buy slaves to carry their goods. Central Africa was naturally capable of becoming one of the greatest producing countries in the world, and, as such a producer, of taking a large quantity of the manufactured article in return for the raw material. At present the Arab traders from the east had penetrated about half-way across the continent till they were met by the Portuguese traders on the west. The cost of carriage of ivory to the coast was now so great as to absorb nearly all the profits, although a hundred dollars worth of ivory could be bought in the interior for a pound weight of beads. The mineral resources of Central Africa were very great, including coal in large quantities, iron, copper, gold, silver, and others. The oil palm existed over the entire continent to the height of 2,600 feet above the sea; and nutmeg trees grew wild. He had walked for 200 and 300 yards at a time through nutmeg groves, the ground being literally covered with the nuts—all going to waste. At present nobody knew their value; they sought only for ivory, and thought of nothing else. In order to develop trade in these rich districts, one thing was essential—proper means of communication must be established. There were already three great water highways—the Nile, the Congo, and the Zambesi. Of these the most important was the Congo, by far the largest river in Africa. Its mouth did not now belong to any civilized country, like the Nile or Zambesi; and whilst the journey by the Congo to the heart of Africa would be only 500 to 600 miles, the like journey by the Nile would be 3,000 or 4,000 miles, and on the route they would everywhere find the Egyptian traders in conflict with the natives. In fact, no expedition could now make its way into Africa from the north by means of the Nile except by means of armed force. From the Congo to the head waters of the Zambesi a canal of twenty to thirty miles in length across a level country would connect the two systems, and provide an uninterrupted water communication across the entire continent. (Hear, hear.) By means of the northern affluents of the Congo they would afford easy water carriage to the coast from other extensive districts. The mouth of the Congo had no bar, and was not difficult of approach. There were some rocks in the stream, but such as steam navigation would easily deal with. At one place there were cataracts, but a porterage of about thirty miles would enable travellers to reach the upper waters of the Congo. The Lualaba, which nobody, he thought, now doubted was the upper Congo, was a splendid stream. At one place he measured it, and found it 1,080 yards across, with an average depth of one fathom, but with three channels of over three fathoms\' depth; and as this was the dry season, it was clear that the stream was navigable all the year round. By sending out steamers to be taken to pieces at the rapids, and put together again above them, they could force their way right into the continent, and get access to Lake Tanganyika. Of course human porterage could not compete with steam carriage; goods would be brought to the coast cheaply, and thus one great blow would be struck at the slave-trade. Already on Lake Nyassa the Scotch missionaries had a steamer, and if they could only get steam on to Tanganyika, they would get command of the whole of that splendid water to its southern extremity. The King of the Belgians had been talking of getting up an international scheme for exploring and civilizing Africa. His idea was to form stations right across the continent, and so form a great trunk road; and as the continent at that part was only 1,600 to 1,700 miles across, it was quite possible to establish such a line of communication. Having ridiculed the arguments of those who would let Africa alone, through a sentimental reluctance to interfere with the liberty of the native races, remarking that there was little liberty under the rule of despots who in a drunken freak would cut off the ears and noses of their subjects, Commander Cameron advocated the establishment of a great company which should be upon the model of the East India Company, because no capitalists would risk their money unless protected from the inroads of others who would otherwise reap the benefits of their first labours and expenses.

These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

That they are instruments in the world's advancement, is undeniable. We alluded last month to the impulse given to the search for available fibre, consequent upon the failure of the cotton supply from America, and of the influence fibre might exercise in the great work of African industrial regeneration. It is scarcely necessary to say here that we believe in that regeneration. And feeble as the evidences of its approach may seem to the world at large, we think we see in them a strength that nothing can long impede or overcome. Yes, Africa must emerge from her Pagan superstition, her wars and atrocities, her industrial apathy and inertia. Looking at her in relation with the rest of the world some ten years since, the prospect was gloomy enough; the day of her emerging seemed indefinitely postponed. This was only because we could not see what was in the womb of time. Those ten years, a brief space in the world's history, have been mighty in the agencies which they have organised for African advancement.

Palm oil has become the great staple of Western Africa. Taking into account the difficulty of access to the interior, and the manners and habits of the people, it must be admitted that the trade in this useful article has had an extraordinary development. Palm oil was precisely such an article as the barbarous inhabitants of a tropical climate needed to possess in the infancy of their commerce. The tree which produces the palm-oil nut is the most valuable of all trees to the native African. It grows spontaneously over large tracts of country. It furnishes him with oil, wine, vinegar, thatch, fibre, and fuel.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

This is brought down from the interior, and retains a large proportion of the fat or gelatine, from the fact, probably, that it is from the recently living animals. In this state it is called green ivory. It is not so white as the kinds called white ivory, which have been lying a longer time exposed to the heat of the sun until the animal matter has disappeared. The excellence of green ivory consists in its greater toughness and in its growing whiter by age, instead of yellow, as is the case with the whiter varieties. Yet buyers of cutlery, through ignorance of these qualities, usually prefer the whiter kinds, which on that account are more in demand for the Sheffield trade, and have more than doubled in price since 1879.\n\nThe sales of ivory occur every three months at London and Liverpool, and sales are also held at irregular intervals at Rotterdam. At Liverpool, only ivory of the best quality is offered. Buyers from Germany and France and agents of American consumers attend these sales; and it is estimated that about one quarter of the whole amount goes to Sheffield, another quarter to London, and the other half to Germany, France, and the United States. There is just now great anxiety as to the future supply of ivory. The stocks in public warehouses are smaller than for many years past, and the rapid increase in prices is causing great anxiety to manufacturers. At a recent sale at Liverpool, the best African ivory sold by the ton at over 12s. 6d. per pound. This will explain the fact that the principal factor in the value of the best table cutlery is the handle. When the ivory comes into the hands of the cutler, much skill is required to make the most of the material, and every scrap is turned to account. After cutting out the scales of all sizes for pocket-knives, and the solid handles for table cutlery, the small pieces are usually sold to the button-makers, or may be made into pearls. These latter are the small pieces of ivory, pearl, or horn inserted into the handles of tea and coffee pots as non-conductors of heat, and are so called because they were originally made of pearl. The fine sawdust is sold for fertilising purposes, for the manufacture of gelatine, and for making a sizing used in the manufacture of lace fabrics. The refuse still remaining goes to the makers of ivory black. The proportion of this residuum is about fifteen pounds to the hundredweight, and sells at from £16 to £20 per ton. Many efforts have been made to devise some method for the solidification of ivory dust, but as yet without success.

Expeditions are rapidly following one another and giving us full information about the interior of Equatorial Africa. Railways and canals are proposed for the opening up of that part of Africa, and they will, years hence, no doubt, prove an incalculable benefit; but why should we wait for these costly works? Why not utilize the arteries already provided by nature for traffic with the interior? Northwest Africa is a market to a great extent as yet unworked. The markets of Sego and Timbuctoo, Hamdallahi, and other large towns on the Upper Niger are most inadequately supplied with British goods by caravans from Tunis, Tripoli, Mogador, and Senegal, and the carriage is so expensive that none but the lightest and most valuable can be imported across the desert. Now the French river, Senegal, though it drains the country for over 700 miles, is practically useless as a channel of commerce. It has a bad and dangerous bar. Ships have often to lie outside weeks, and even months, waiting to enter the port of St. Louis. Its channel into the interior is full of sand bars and rocks, obstructing navigation by even small craft for most of the year; and the tribes to the north-east of its head-waters, of Arab origin, are ferocious and predatory, living by plunder; therefore, commerce meets with danger and difficulty in their neighbourhood. About 180 miles to the south is the Gambia, which seems intended by nature to be the main road for commerce, civilization, and religion into North-west Africa.

299,The integration of African cotton into Liverpool markets during the colonial period underscores Africa's significant role in the early global trade networks and the textile industry.,"The integration of African cotton into Liverpool markets during the colonial period is a topic that reveals differing emphases in historical sources. The General History of Africa textbook provides a broad context on the integration of African economies into global trade networks, highlighting cotton as a key cash crop in regions like Uganda, Nigeria, and Tanganyika. However, it does not specifically connect African cotton to Liverpool markets or emphasize its role in the early global textile industry. Instead, it focuses on the broader integration of African economies into the capitalist world-economy and the exploitative nature of colonial trade practices, suggesting that while Africa was part of global trade networks, the textbook does not underscore a significant role for African cotton in the early global textile industry as the claim suggests. In contrast, The African Times news articles offer detailed support for the claim, highlighting the active trade of African cotton in Liverpool markets with specific price quotations and sales volumes, indicating its demand and integration into the textile industry. The articles discuss challenges and opportunities in the African cotton trade, such as the need for reduced freight rates and the potential for Africa to become a significant cotton supplier. They also mention efforts like the establishment of the West Africa Company and native cotton-growing associations in Sierra Leone to enhance Africa's role in the global cotton trade. These details align with the claim by illustrating Africa's involvement in early global trade networks and its contribution to the textile industry through cotton exports, while also acknowledging challenges such as competition with established cotton producers like America and India. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view of Africa's integration into global markets, with The African Times offering specific evidence of African cotton's role in Liverpool markets, which the General History of Africa does not explicitly address.","The General History of Africa textbook provides some context on the integration of African economies into global trade networks during the colonial period, but it does not specifically highlight the integration of African cotton into Liverpool markets.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': 'who went into the interior and shipped them overseas, and vice-versa. 23 New export-oriented production necessarily implied new imports.

On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': 'African resistance helped substantially to dictate a slow pace of economic colonization for at least the three decades between 1880 and 1910. Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence.

Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded.

But, of course, that is just the point. In the nineteenth century, they were willy-nilly incorporated into the world-economy, and their behaviour was a function of this reality. world-economy. This political shift, however, itself reflected the long upturn and expansion of the world-economy. The British basically lost little time in beginning to restructure production processes so as to incorporate effectively the region. They increased shipping markedly, brought in new British colonists, and developed commercial sheep-rearing such that by the mid-1840s the Cape Colony had become a significant locus of pro› duction for the world-economy.$^{27}$ Later, Natal became a locus of sugar production on plantations using indentured Indian labour."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Economic zones and trading networks', 'content': ""They set up trading centres (e.g. Lukolele), went down the river as far as the Tio markets on the Pool, travelled upstream into the interior, collecting ivory and slaves, especially from the Mongo. They introduced into the rain-forest regions important trading commodities hitherto unknown such as guns, copper rings, new varieties of crops, etc. As we have seen, the slave trade encouraged the growth of small population centres comprising captives, refugees and other groups, who were concentrated around a trading centre on the river bank, or simply around private individuals who had made their fortune in trade.$^{15}$ Ngaliema, a former slave who grew rich and held sway over the Pool region around 1880, falls into this latter category. During the colonial occupation, administrative bases established by the state, as well as trading posts and mission stations used the same method to mass together captive populations as the canoe traders had done before them.\nThe Portuguese-African network was the oldest and most elaborate in Central Africa.$^{16}$ Changes in the map of its routes can be followed through› out the nineteenth century. In the first half of the century, the principal groups of tracks or 'corridors' led to Luanda and Benguela. Three large economic and cultural regions were centred on the roads leading to Luanda: the Kongo region with its 'Mubire' (Vili) network of tracks which passed through the Kwango chiefdoms (especially Holo) and Encoge, an Angolan fortified outpost; the region comprising the western Lunda states, reached either by crossing the territory of the Imbangala of Kassanje and passing through Ambaca, another Angolan outpost, or by travelling through the Songo and Pungo Andongo country; finally, the Ovimbundu region, which maintained regular contacts with Pungo Andongo and the other Angolan posts in the Kwanza valley. The Ovimbundu highlands were linked to the coast by another route that led to Caconda and Benguela. Traders used this 'corridor' to penetrate southwards and eastwards into the Nyaneka, Nkhumbi and Guanguela regions.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area. This production at first co-existed with the slave trade,$^{14}$ and later flourished on its own, until the boom came to an end in 1861, and finally declined at the end of the century.$^{15}$ The palm-oil trade similarly expanded in the Gold He finds the relevant consideration to be Europe's need of raw materials and points out the 'extraordinary demands on production' involved in the new amounts of palm oil, timber, and rubber exported.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650. The numbers by 1750 were about triple those of 1650. 4"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Unprecedented commercial penetration from the East African coast during the nineteenth century resulted in the incorporation of most of Central Africa into the capitalist world economy. As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks. On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

And it is a good omen that simultaneously a native cotton-growing association is announced at Sierra Leone, the short distance of which from England renders it the more important that it should become a large cotton-producing colony. Except at Abeokuta and Lagos, English merchants have never hitherto sought for cotton. We know that cotton produced on the protected territories of the Gold Coast failed some time ago to find any market, to the great discouragement of the native growers, who were inclined to enter systematically upon its production. We have no doubt, therefore, that the news of the formation of the West Africa Company, which the African Times will now carry to all the principal districts, from the Gambia to the Gaboon, will lead to a growth of cotton that will justify the friends of Africa, and surprise those who have hitherto ignored Africa as a permanent source of cotton supply.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-11-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Freight of Cotton from Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is especially our duty, as guardian of West African interests, to keep a vigilant watch upon commercial as well as administrative proceedings, that we may point the way to a removal of any impediment to that development of material resources on which the future welfare of the African countries so much depends. In doing this, one such impediment stands out in strong relief; while, in consequence of the rapid change now taking place in the mode of conducting the business of this country with West Africa, we feel convinced that it is only necessary we should throw a strong and just light upon it to lead to its speedy removal. This impediment is the rate of freight on cotton from West African countries to England. At the first glance it may be thought by the owners of steam and sailing ships trading with Africa that we are premature in mooting the subject of a reduction in the rates of freight on cotton. It may be urged by them that these rates have undergone a reduction of 50 per cent., and their first impulse will no doubt be to say that it is preposterous to expect they can be still further reduced. It is true, thanks to the British and African Steam Navigation Company, that the rate of freight on cotton is now 3d. per pound instead of 1¼d. per pound, as it was in the days of steam monopoly by the African Steamship Company; but, at the same time, it is equally true that the rate of 3d. per pound is still too high a rate for the products of an industry that needs to be nursed and encouraged, and is consequently an impediment to that increase in the growth of cotton in West Africa which is so desirable for the progress of the African countries and the interests of Great Britain. Only those who, thirsting for African advancement, were watching the onward march of African agricultural industry, were sensible of the great impediment to the cotton culture which 1¼d. per pound freight on cotton to England placed in its way. It was a grievous error of the African Steamship Company to impose such a freight on cotton. The earliest efforts made in cotton culture for exportation, under the munificent donation of Miss Burdett Coutts so ably applied by Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester, had established that cotton might be made in the course of time to figure largely in the exports of West Africa; that soil and climate favoured its growth, and that the natives in certain districts were willing to cultivate it for foreign markets. But 1¼d. per pound freight to Liverpool was a frightful obstacle, and the rate of progress was very slow until the disastrous civil war in America raised the price of New Orleans cotton from 5d. to above 2s. per pound. The African cotton from the Egba Countries is not much inferior to the New Orleans; it therefore approximated in value to the latter in the British markets, and the high price gave a stimulus to the African cotton industry which enabled it to triumph over the 1¼d. obstacle. Prices receded after the termination of the American war, but until lately they have been such as still to allow the production in Africa to progress, notwithstanding the 1¼d. and, later, as at present, 3d. freight. But the joint influence, temporarily of the European war, and, we believe permanently, of increased production in the United States, with the opening of new facilities of supply from India to England, via the Suez Canal, has caused a rapid fall in prices during the last few months, a fall which seems to point unmistakeably to prices somewhat similar to those which ruled immediately before the American struggle. We do not hesitate to say that this change of circumstance necessitates a change of rate of freight on cotton from Africa to England—necessitates it both in the interests of Africa and of the steam companies themselves. We are convinced that in what we are about to ask we are consulting their best interests. The interests of conveyers of produce from the Coast cannot be dissociated from those of the producers and traders. The African Steam Company did not see this heretofore; monopoly often creates blindness; but better counsels now prevail, a clearer sight has now been given, and we expect to see the now friendly rivals, the two great Steamship Companies, carefully watching the rise of any new agricultural industry in the African countries, and fostering and giving impetus to it by low rates of freight for the new product in the infancy of production. There are only three of the West African exports that depend entirely on what may be strictly called agricultural industry. These are ground-nuts, ginger, and cotton. The first of these has already established itself as a great staple, and may therefore be placed, more or less, although it has now a growing competition with the East Indies and other countries, in the same category with the grand staple, palm-oil, which may be left to take care of itself without any fear of prejudice thereby resulting to it. But cotton requires, demands, the nursing care of the shipowners. It has not, like palm-oil, a monopoly in European markets; it has to struggle against the organised production in America, the East Indies, Egypt, and other countries where a large capital and great facilities of transit, together with all the economising appliances which large capital only can command, give it great advantages. Under these circumstances it is to the interest, as we have before said, of this country, of the steam companies, and of Africa, that it should be treated with exceptional tenderness. And as the African advocate and guardian we earnestly ask this of them. We want to see this cotton industry so important to Great Britain, greatly and rapidly developed in the Egba, Yoruba, and Volta Countries. The latter, whenever a permanent pacification takes place, by the country becoming secured against Ashantee inroads, may be made a large cotton producer. Mr. J. C. Brandt, and one or two other Accra men, gave the first impulse, we believe, in Krepee, during the American war, and the German missionary traders followed profitably in the same path. The Ashantee invasion has for a time greatly impaired this industry, but there is every reason why, with so industrious a people as the Krepees, and good soil and climate, there should be a large exportation via the River Volta from Krepee, if the Steam Companies act on our suggestion. And we are not asking them to make any great present sacrifice to their own future and Africa's permanent interests. We are not going to ask them to bring cotton from Lagos or the Volta or Accra, to Liverpool, at freights lower than the average paid for cotton of other countries to that port. American cotton pays 7-16ths per pound freight by steamers from New York, or 3-16ths per pound by fast-sailing ships; African, even at the now reduced rates, pays 3d. per pound freight equally by the steamships and by those, for the most part, tubs of sailing ships, which manage to take three or four months, at best, to make the voyage. We are only asking them to do what is just and reasonable, and what will be to their own advantage in the long run."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-10-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liverpool Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""**LIVERPOOL MARKETS.**\n\n**June 22 to 29.**\n\n_Adansonia Fibre._—50 bales, at 137. 10s. per ton.\n\n_Palm-oil_ in good demand, at improving rates; 800 tons sold; Irregular at 31l. to 36l., Bonny at 35l. to 35l. 15s., Old Calabar at 35l. 15s. to 36l., Benin at 36l., Accra at 35l. to 36l. 5s., New Calabar at 38l. 10s. to 39l. on the spot, and at 39l. to 39l. 5s. per ton for distant arrival.\n\n_Cotton._—Market heavy first days, and lower, but recovery ensued, and prices have gone up again to last week's rates.

Colonel Paris presided, and there was a large attendance of members and others interested. Commander Cameron, who, on rising, was loudly applauded, said: What he wished to speak about was the commerce of Africa, and what would come out of the Berlin Conference, and other events which were now happening; for the Conference could not fail to be of great importance to British trade. Tropical Africa, except in a few cases, on the shores of great water-ways, was scarcely known. From the interior the difficulties of transport prevented any profit except on the most valuable products. The first idea of the trader seemed ivory. India-rubber was coming into use, and before he left the West Coast over £20,000 worth had been exported from Zanzibar in one year. Many valuable gums and spices were found in Central Africa. Africa was to all appearance, until a few years ago, the happy hunting ground of Englishmen; it was only those who voyaged who could really compete with us. Now all these things were changed, and on every side they saw a scramble for Africa. It was our duty to know as much as possible about the resources of this continent, and how the future of Africa was to be controlled by the Congo Free State, which promised to be the outcome of the Berlin Conference. Very great results were to be expected, and he might mention that, north-east of Victoria Nyanza, there was a plateau which might be colonized by Europeans, and whence trade might be put into some of the great producing centres of Africa. The trade of the Arab at Zanzibar was carried out by a system of advance. On the west coast there was a trade carried on by a few Europeans. In the last century the Portuguese had an enormous trade up the Zambesi, and in Zumbo Town there were the ruins of a cathedral and a university which had at one time 370 students. There were two other towns of equal importance. The great difficulty in this trade was the climate. At a conference in Brussels in 1876, the idea of an International Association was sketched, and the King of the Belgians had set himself steadfastly to work to further this great idea of promoting the civilization of the ""Dark Continent."" Nearly all the people of Africa were traders; the cultivation of the soil was relegated to the women. At Nyanza there were enormous assemblies of people, some of whom came to market 15 or 20 miles, travelling against the current of the Congo. From this locality he had brought home nutmegs that were of the greatest use in commerce. From the same region there came wild coffee. There were enormous districts where any amount of rice could be grown; you had only to ""scratch the earth,"" and it smiled at you. At some of these interior stations whole caravans were supplied by small villages with wheat sufficient for a week\'s journey. The people of those villages were able to produce for from ten to twelve times their number with scarcely any labour. On the Niger we had utilized water traffic, and the Congo had a number of miles of water carriage which could be utilized. There was, at the same time, the great difficulty of getting from the coast to this system on the Congo. Various schemes had been proposed to connect Stanley Pool with the Congo by railway, and he believed that after the settlement of the dispute between France and the International Association, the French would construct a railway to Stanley Pool, or the Association from the left bank of the Congo, and they would then be able to have instant communication with the centre of Africa. Further south, the Portuguese were beginning to wake up to the value of their territories. They were now making contracts to construct a railway into the interior. It was their duty as Englishmen to look after that scheme. The region he was speaking of produced ivory, gum, cotton, and spices. The Powers at the Berlin Conference had recognized the International Association as practically a sovereign State. What they must strongly insist upon was free trade, and permission to reside and trade in the Free State. Another point was as to the mode in which future annexations were to be made. Annexations had been going on rather fast lately, and the Conference agreement was to the effect that when a place was annexed notice was to be sent to the other countries, and that people trading at such a place were to continue trading under the same guarantees as formerly. He fancied that would be simply that there might be equal rights to all nations, and people already trading in places which had no European sovereign might find their positions injured by annexation on the part of European Powers. In this matter, also, he thought that great care had to be exercised. Then they had to think of the great trade which used to pass down Egypt from the Upper Nile. The Suakin and Berber Railway was contracted for at one time by Ismail Pasha, but he was compelled to give up the idea. If that railway had been built, we should have had none of the difficulties in the Soudan which we had at present. He mentioned as a sign of the times that an Ambassador from Timbuctoo was at Paris treating with the President of the French Republic. We had the trade of the Lower Niger in our hands, but in the Upper Niger a great portion of the trade might be diverted from us if the proposed railway were completed. There was one thing which he must say, and that was that if we wanted outlets for our goods we must send proper and suitable goods for the people. The establishment of the Congo Free State would prove a benefit to English trade, but we must watch the constitution of that State, and, if there were any objectionable features in it, get them removed. In conclusion, Commander Cameron remarked that in a very large portion of Africa cotton of very good quality grew. He had specimens at home of cotton goods which had been made by the natives in the interior, and he believed that, as communication improved they would see cargoes of cotton coming to Liverpool from Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo.

No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN FIBRES', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There can be no doubt that the future industrial prosperity of Africa will depend, in a great measure, upon its cotton; but as auxiliary to this, its fibres will exercise an important influence in the progress of civilization.

The world wants them. The incumbrances of tropical vegetation have received marked attention. It has been discovered that they are not valueless, and science has set to work for utilising them. Very important results have been obtained. The great difficulty as regards most fibres was that of preparing them, by a cheap and simple process, for manufacturing purposes. The old steeping system rotted and discoloured them; their beauty and strength were impaired by it, and it was a tedious, laborious, and unhealthy work. It could only be owing to such impediments that the many beautiful fibres of Jamaica which were so admired at the recent Exhibition had been hitherto neglected.

301,"In the 19th century, Africa's substantial cotton exports, driven by figures like Samuel Crowther and the Crepee people's confidence in trade, highlight the continent's early integration into global markets and economic reliance on agricultural products.","The claim that Africa's substantial cotton exports in the 19th century, driven by figures like Samuel Crowther and the Crepee people's confidence in trade, highlight the continent's early integration into global markets and economic reliance on agricultural products is nuanced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not specifically mention Samuel Crowther or the Crepee people in the context of cotton exports, instead focusing on the broader economic shifts from the slave trade to export agriculture, with an emphasis on products like palm oil and groundnuts rather than cotton. It highlights Africa's integration into the global capitalist system but notes the lack of technological advancement and economic disadvantages. In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim, noting Crowther's efforts to establish a cotton market along the Niger and Tshadda rivers and the Crepee people's growing confidence in cotton trade, indicating early attempts at global market integration. However, the articles also point out challenges such as high freight rates that hindered the cotton industry's growth and emphasize palm oil as the dominant export, suggesting that cotton was not as substantial an export as the claim implies. Together, these sources suggest that while there were efforts to integrate African cotton into global markets, the continent's economic reliance on cotton was not as significant as the claim suggests, with other agricultural products playing a more prominent role.","The General History of Africa textbook does not specifically mention figures like Samuel Crowther or the Crepee people in the context of 19th-century cotton exports. However, it does discuss the broader economic shifts in Africa during this period, including the transition from the slave trade to export agriculture, which included products like cotton. The text highlights the integration of African economies into the global capitalist system through export agriculture, but it emphasizes palm oil, groundnuts, and other products more than cotton. The textbook also notes the lack of technological advancement in production methods and the resulting economic disadvantages for Africa. While the claim suggests a focus on cotton and specific figures, the textbook provides a more generalized view of Africa's economic integration and reliance on agricultural exports without highlighting cotton as a primary export or mentioning specific individuals or groups like Samuel Crowther or the Crepee people. This difference suggests that the claim may be emphasizing a narrower aspect of Africa's economic history that is not prominently featured in the textbook.","The African Times news articles provide several details that both support and refute the claim regarding Africa's cotton exports in the 19th century. Samuel Crowther's account highlights efforts to establish a cotton market along the Niger and Tshadda rivers, indicating an early attempt to integrate African cotton into global markets. Crowther's work, along with the Crepee people's growing confidence in selling cotton, suggests a budding economic reliance on agricultural products. However, the articles also reveal challenges, such as the high freight rates on cotton exports, which impeded the growth of the cotton industry in West Africa. Additionally, while there is mention of cotton being produced and traded, the articles emphasize the dominance of palm oil as the primary export from West Africa, suggesting that cotton was not yet a substantial export compared to other agricultural products. This indicates that while there were efforts to integrate African cotton into global markets, the continent's economic reliance on cotton was not as significant as the claim suggests.",True,301,Economic Impact and Trade Dynamics,Global Economic Integration of African economies,"[{'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.748, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples.

Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy.

Within two generations, there developed a network of social and cultural relation› ships through which goods and services circulated with remarkable efficiency. New migrants like the mukama Womunafu and his entourage brought a stock of goods, skills and new technologies; the demand for specialized goods like ironware, especially farming implements, pottery and salt led to occasional fairs to which people brought their surplus produce such as barkcloth, skins and live animals in exchange; others took their produce to the locations of known specialist craftsmen like blacksmiths, fishermen and potters. Similarly, goods and services circulated through payments for rituals and worship, or in payment of bride price and other social dues, and even in raiding, stealing and kidnapping. As Cohen has put it, his study \'offers a series of images of a regional economy of the unadministered zone in the early nineteenth century structured not upon the ""channeled effect"" associated with international and interregional trade but structured, rather, upon a remarkably extensive and thickly knit network of circulation, distribution and redistribution."" 9 The nineteenth century brought changes, new pressures and oppor› tunities even for the people in Bunafu, as in other places. As the family expanded, land hitherto regarded as marginal began to be cultivated. New crops hitherto regarded with caution were experimented with and some became new staples. The \'economic horizon\' of the villagers expanded as the trame strengthened the links that stretched from the villages to the coastal ports and overseas markets. Expansion of trade brought social and political changes. Initially, it tended to strengthen the position of chiefs who found it easier to accumulate wealth from taxing trade in salt, iron and copper, not to mention ivory, beeswax and palm oil, than from tribute in agricultural produce and customary labour. At the same time the profits of trade could not be so easily monopolized. Several individuals moved away from their customary locations to seek their fortunes, and social mobility was thus facilitated. But these changes were slow and represented not so much innovation as expansion of tendencies and patterns already evident by the eighteenth century.

On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'On the eve of the nineteenth century', 'content': ""Just as far-reaching political changes antedated the nineteenth century, so complex trading networks operated throughout the region well before the nineteenth-century expansion.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 88, 'article_title': 'COTTON!

Still, I have been able to send many of my things by carts hither, which saved me a good deal of trouble in passing 50lb. loads.\n\n_As for the cotton prospects_, I know this much, that the Crepee people are beginning to have confidence in the promises to buy their cotton, so they have sold a good deal to Mr. Brandt, and will probably farm cotton on a larger scale. There is wanted more energy in buying the cotton, and machinery to cleanse it. Our agent is crippled by having lost his energetic assistant, and a second help, a man who was only a few months in the country when he was carried away by low fever.\n\nGovernor Pine has taken steps to bring the Kroboes to pay their debts, which I believe will be successful, and hinder an expedition. I have the impression that Governor Pine is the right man for us, especially as he has twenty years\' experience how to deal with the African race; and the negro is the same in every part of Africa. I am told that the Kroboes are trying to pay in cowries, which I hope the Governor will accept, as I know it is the only way of settling this affair quickly, though, of course, with some loss for the firms.\n\nIf the Governor could succeed in opening the resources of our country, so that the coffers of the Government could be filled with money, which could again be spent for the benefit of the country, he would be entitled to great praise. It is a pity when a governor has to answer, ""We have no money; our treasury is empty."" If he is more careful than his predecessors to expend the poll-tax for the country, he will gain much.

We believe that such an organization, *conducted on correct principles*, would not only be a pecuniary success, but a blessing to Africa and the world. We think this would be especially true, *if the development of a trade in cotton were made a prominent object*. There is unquestionably a very considerable quantity of cotton produced within reach of the navigable waters of the Sherboro, and such cotton can be purchased at a very moderate price in exchange for cash or European goods. We have long believed that if a central agency were established here on this island, and sub-agents were sent to the head of boat navigation of the rivers that run into the Sherboro, with instructions to give specific attention to the development of a cotton trade (in connexion with other branches of commerce), a considerable quantity of cotton would be at once obtained, and its production materially promoted. We look upon this as the only feasible plan of obtaining cotton from this part of the coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Freight of Cotton from Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is especially our duty, as guardian of West African interests, to keep a vigilant watch upon commercial as well as administrative proceedings, that we may point the way to a removal of any impediment to that development of material resources on which the future welfare of the African countries so much depends. In doing this, one such impediment stands out in strong relief; while, in consequence of the rapid change now taking place in the mode of conducting the business of this country with West Africa, we feel convinced that it is only necessary we should throw a strong and just light upon it to lead to its speedy removal. This impediment is the rate of freight on cotton from West African countries to England. At the first glance it may be thought by the owners of steam and sailing ships trading with Africa that we are premature in mooting the subject of a reduction in the rates of freight on cotton. It may be urged by them that these rates have undergone a reduction of 50 per cent., and their first impulse will no doubt be to say that it is preposterous to expect they can be still further reduced. It is true, thanks to the British and African Steam Navigation Company, that the rate of freight on cotton is now 3d. per pound instead of 1¼d. per pound, as it was in the days of steam monopoly by the African Steamship Company; but, at the same time, it is equally true that the rate of 3d. per pound is still too high a rate for the products of an industry that needs to be nursed and encouraged, and is consequently an impediment to that increase in the growth of cotton in West Africa which is so desirable for the progress of the African countries and the interests of Great Britain. Only those who, thirsting for African advancement, were watching the onward march of African agricultural industry, were sensible of the great impediment to the cotton culture which 1¼d. per pound freight on cotton to England placed in its way. It was a grievous error of the African Steamship Company to impose such a freight on cotton. The earliest efforts made in cotton culture for exportation, under the munificent donation of Miss Burdett Coutts so ably applied by Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester, had established that cotton might be made in the course of time to figure largely in the exports of West Africa; that soil and climate favoured its growth, and that the natives in certain districts were willing to cultivate it for foreign markets. But 1¼d. per pound freight to Liverpool was a frightful obstacle, and the rate of progress was very slow until the disastrous civil war in America raised the price of New Orleans cotton from 5d. to above 2s. per pound. The African cotton from the Egba Countries is not much inferior to the New Orleans; it therefore approximated in value to the latter in the British markets, and the high price gave a stimulus to the African cotton industry which enabled it to triumph over the 1¼d. obstacle. Prices receded after the termination of the American war, but until lately they have been such as still to allow the production in Africa to progress, notwithstanding the 1¼d. and, later, as at present, 3d. freight. But the joint influence, temporarily of the European war, and, we believe permanently, of increased production in the United States, with the opening of new facilities of supply from India to England, via the Suez Canal, has caused a rapid fall in prices during the last few months, a fall which seems to point unmistakeably to prices somewhat similar to those which ruled immediately before the American struggle. We do not hesitate to say that this change of circumstance necessitates a change of rate of freight on cotton from Africa to England—necessitates it both in the interests of Africa and of the steam companies themselves. We are convinced that in what we are about to ask we are consulting their best interests. The interests of conveyers of produce from the Coast cannot be dissociated from those of the producers and traders. The African Steam Company did not see this heretofore; monopoly often creates blindness; but better counsels now prevail, a clearer sight has now been given, and we expect to see the now friendly rivals, the two great Steamship Companies, carefully watching the rise of any new agricultural industry in the African countries, and fostering and giving impetus to it by low rates of freight for the new product in the infancy of production. There are only three of the West African exports that depend entirely on what may be strictly called agricultural industry. These are ground-nuts, ginger, and cotton. The first of these has already established itself as a great staple, and may therefore be placed, more or less, although it has now a growing competition with the East Indies and other countries, in the same category with the grand staple, palm-oil, which may be left to take care of itself without any fear of prejudice thereby resulting to it. But cotton requires, demands, the nursing care of the shipowners. It has not, like palm-oil, a monopoly in European markets; it has to struggle against the organised production in America, the East Indies, Egypt, and other countries where a large capital and great facilities of transit, together with all the economising appliances which large capital only can command, give it great advantages. Under these circumstances it is to the interest, as we have before said, of this country, of the steam companies, and of Africa, that it should be treated with exceptional tenderness. And as the African advocate and guardian we earnestly ask this of them. We want to see this cotton industry so important to Great Britain, greatly and rapidly developed in the Egba, Yoruba, and Volta Countries. The latter, whenever a permanent pacification takes place, by the country becoming secured against Ashantee inroads, may be made a large cotton producer. Mr. J. C. Brandt, and one or two other Accra men, gave the first impulse, we believe, in Krepee, during the American war, and the German missionary traders followed profitably in the same path. The Ashantee invasion has for a time greatly impaired this industry, but there is every reason why, with so industrious a people as the Krepees, and good soil and climate, there should be a large exportation via the River Volta from Krepee, if the Steam Companies act on our suggestion. And we are not asking them to make any great present sacrifice to their own future and Africa's permanent interests. We are not going to ask them to bring cotton from Lagos or the Volta or Accra, to Liverpool, at freights lower than the average paid for cotton of other countries to that port. American cotton pays 7-16ths per pound freight by steamers from New York, or 3-16ths per pound by fast-sailing ships; African, even at the now reduced rates, pays 3d. per pound freight equally by the steamships and by those, for the most part, tubs of sailing ships, which manage to take three or four months, at best, to make the voyage. We are only asking them to do what is just and reasonable, and what will be to their own advantage in the long run."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-10-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West Africa Company', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The establishment of the West Africa Company is the first indication that the public and those more immediately connected with the cotton-manufacturing industry begin to comprehend the vast resources of Western Africa as regards the important staple for which we have so long depended entirely on America.

Mr. Isaac Bradshaw (Preston) spoke strongly in favour of bringing the movement to a proper consummation, but said it would be of gradual growth. He said that Mr. Hermon, M.P., a large manufacturer, sympathized with the movement, and was only prevented from attending the meeting through illness.

He described the immense area, natural wealth, and population of Africa, and said the country presented facilities second to none in the world for pushing commerce, but to do this they must get into the interior, and it was proposed to form a powerful financial company to lay a railway five hundred miles long from the East of Africa to Victoria Nyanza Lake. Twenty-four hundred million yards of cotton goods were annually consumed in India, and he did not see why as much should not be effected in a country like Africa. To carry out this great work successfully, they would require an ultimate capital of ten millions sterling.—Mr. Howard (Preston) moved: ""That this meeting earnestly wishes the co-operation of capitalists and the working population generally with a view to opening up Central Africa to our trade.""—Mr. W.

The space within the walls is usually extensive, and interspersed with cultivated fields, rendering it difficult to estimate the population. In the towns markets are held every two or three days, and in some places daily, and attended by numbers from neighboring villages, and although the total of their dealings would appear trifling, still there is everywhere shown a strong love of trade. At these markets are exposed for sale produce of all kinds, besides native and European wares. Cotton and indigo are cultivated, and there is an extensive manufacture of cotton cloth, noted for its quality and the durability of the dye, which finds a ready market among the negroes of Brazil. Besides cloths, there are manufactures of saddlery, cushions, &c. The art of smelting metals is understood, and gold chains and ornaments are manufactured with taste and skill. The trade of the blacksmith is everywhere plied. At the 1851 Exhibition specimens of native copper ware, tinned inside, were exhibited. European goods are brought from Tripoli and Morocco, and are estimated to treble in value by the time they reach Kano, the great centre of trade. Goods find their way in limited quantities from the coast, but are subject to heavy exactions as they pass along. The goods are transported by caravan in packages varying from 60lb. to 100lb. on the heads of slaves, except where the rivers afford water transport. Some of the canoes on the Niger approaching the sea are large enough to convey upwards of 100 people. Salt is a prime article of commerce; it is brought by caravan from the Great Desert and from the coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1886#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agriculture on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In a very interesting report on economic agriculture on the Gold Coast, issued from the Colonial Office, some noteworthy information relating to the cultivation of cotton in that part of West Africa is included. Although cotton grows wild in the colony it is almost neglected, except in the Volta district, where Messrs. F. & A. Swanzy have plantations. The quantity exported is extremely small. This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture. The enormous number of silk-cotton trees in the colony would yield a plentiful supply if the people found it worth collecting and exporting, and the timber is used for making fishing canoes.\n\nRice also might be made an important crop on the Gold Coast. It is grown in the Axim and Quittah districts. In the former district a red variety is grown in the marshy plains. It is large, soft-grained, and sweet, resembling the Sierra Leone rice. In the Quittah district an upland sort is grown, and forms the staple food of the inhabitants. These two districts are capable of supplying the requirements of the whole colony, and other districts are adapted to the growth of this crop, in which a large and profitable foreign trade might be carried on, yet the colony imports largely, as will be seen by the following statement:', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.744, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained. For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom.

In the former place it is in the forest in the mountain district, and is known by the name of ""Bush pepper."" Its leaves are used medicinally by the natives as a vermifuge. It has a very pointed stem, and grows wild, climbing principally on very tall trees. It requires but very little attention, and Western Africa will, sooner or later, become an exporter of great quantities.

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each.

The tree which produces the palm-oil nut is the most valuable of all trees to the native African. It grows spontaneously over large tracts of country.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The rise of export agriculture and the import of European manufactures, particularly from Great Britain, further linked African economies to the capitalist world-economy, underscoring their significance to European industrial interests. However, the textbook does not provide detailed documentation of trade prices and sales volumes. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed documentation of these aspects, highlighting the trade of commodities such as palm oil, palm kernels, cotton, and ivory, and their price fluctuations in European markets like Liverpool and Hamburg. The articles underscore the economic ties between Africa and Europe through reports on exports and imports, the involvement of European merchants, and the establishment of trade routes. They also discuss the impact of European commercial activities on African economies, such as the development of the palm oil trade and the shift to legitimate commerce. Despite the challenges faced by African producers, such as price depressions and economic fluctuations, the articles provide a nuanced view of the economic interactions between Africa and Europe, illustrating how African resources were integrated into European industrial supply chains, contributing to the economic interests of European nations.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide several details that support the claim regarding the integration of African economies into global trade systems and their economic significance to European industrial interests in the 19th century.

Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.724, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': 'who went into the interior and shipped them overseas, and vice-versa. 23 New export-oriented production necessarily implied new imports.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life. Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'Another interesting economic change in the nineteenth century, also often ignored by scholars, was the completion of the commercial unification of Africa. In spite of long-established trade routes across the Sahara and across Dârfßr to the Nile Valley, until the beginning of the nineteenth century there were hardly any transcontinental commercial routes linking Central and East Africa or linking Central and North Africa. It was only in the nineteenth century, and even then only from about the third decade onwards, that Central, East and North Africa became inextricably linked by great commercial highways. These were the result of the activities of the Arabs, Swahili, Yao, Nyamwezi and Kamba of East Africa, the Arabs of Egypt and Sudan, and the Tio, Ovimbundu and Chokwe of Central Africa. The outcome of all this was not only the commercial unification of Africa and an increase in intra-African contacts, not only a tremendous increase in the number of African entrepreneurs, middlemen and traders, but above all the progressive opening up of the hinterland of Africa to European and Arab/Swahili influence and manufactured goods with the tragic consequences that have been referred to and that will be discussed in greater detail in Volume VII of the Unesco General History.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'European trading influence spread much more quickly and more widely than missionary influence in the first half of the nineteenth century. This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power. Thus, the diversification of the items of trade without : substantial modification of the pattern of trade did not produce the economic and social revolution expected, at least not in the first half of the', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.752, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""As long as Africa was 'outside' the world-economy, the 'cost' of a slave to the slave-owner was the expense of procurement plus maintenance plus supervision (prorated for his/her life as a slave) divided by total work output during his/her life as a slave. The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy. The first long economic and geographic expan› sion of the capitalist world-economy had occurred between 1450 and 160050. In that period, no part of Africa could be said to have been part of this historical system. The period 1600/50-1730/50 was, for the capitalist worldeconomy, a period of relative stagnation, of taking a breath, of consolidation, primarily within the geographic zones that had already been included in the sixteenth century. It was still largely true at this time that no part of Africa could be said to have been incorporated into this system (with the reservations noted about the changing structure of the slave trade). 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': 'African resistance helped substantially to dictate a slow pace of economic colonization for at least the three decades between 1880 and 1910. Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930.

It is therefore surprising that historians have tended to take the agricultural base of African societies for granted while concentrating on the factor of external trade. 13 Most of the available studies of nineteenth-century agricultural systems in Africa look at them from the standpoint of colonial economies. They tend to be theoretical and ideological, contributing more to the debate about underdevelopment than to an understanding of the historical development of African agriculture in the early nineteenth century. They view African agricultural systems uniformly as sustaining 'natural econ› omies', witnessing the penetration of capital in the mercantilist period, as a prelude to the development of peripheral capitalism in the colonial period. There are only a handful of studies based on empirical data that show how particular agricultural communities in different parts of Africa functioned and developed in the early nineteenth century.

Still the commerce of these colonies is considerable, and quite worth looking after. The total trade of the four colonies in recent years averaged about £3,250,000. In 1884, the exports amounted to £2,000,000, and imports £1,700,000. Two millions of the total trade must be credited to the Gold Coast and Lagos, in which palm oil and palm kernels are of so much importance. The following table shows the value of the imports and exports for 1884:—\n\n|          | Imports. | Exports. |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Gambia   | £212,000 | £200,000 |\n| Sierra Leone | £464,000 | £377,000 |\n| Gold Coast | £527,000 | £467,000 |\n| Lagos    | £538,000 | £672,000 |\n| **Total** | **£1,741,000** | **£1,716,000** |\n\nFor the same year the total revenue of the four colonies was £281,942, and expenditure £269,382. Nearly the whole of the expenditure is for administration, leaving little for public works and the development of the resources of the settlements. The exports during the past ten years show considerable fluctuations in value, depending partly on the market value of the staple products, and partly on the more or less disturbed state of the interior, where the native tribes are constantly at war with each other. In 1875, the value of the exports on the Gold Coast was £327,012; in 1879, it was £751,850; in 1881, 1882, and 1883, it hovered round £350,000; suddenly advancing to £667,000 in 1884. For Lagos, the exports were valued at £517,535 in 1875, £734,707 in 1877, £460,000 in 1881, £594,000 in 1883, and £672,000 in 1884. For the last ten years the exports of Sierra Leone have kept pretty steadily at about £580,000; in 1876 they sank to £297,000, and in 1882 and 1883 rose to £420,000 and £442,000. Gambia shows considerably more variation; in 1875, the exports were valued at £147,465, sinking to £86,000 in 1876, and, with intermediate fluctuations, reaching £254,711 in 1882. Still the progress of the West African colonies during the past twenty-five years in all respects has been very marked, as will be seen from the following table:—\n\n|          | Population. | Revenue. | Tonnage. | Imports. | Exports. |\n|----------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| 1861...  | 289,900     | £69,000  | 230,850  | £517,620 | £550,860 |\n| 1884...  | 800,960     | £285,057 | 1,417,284| £1,741,000| £1,716,000|', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Decade of the Trade of Hamburg with West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'An interesting report from the British Consul-General at Hamburg on the growth of the trade of that port with the West Coast of Africa during the past ten years has lately been issued. The main features of this increase are the establishment of direct and regular steam communication, a fourfold increase in the shipping, an increase in imports of more than sixfold, while exports have doubled.\n\nIn the imports of Hamburg the West Coast of Africa now ranks fifth, and in exports fourth. First, as to shipping—in 1878, 25 vessels, of which 10 were German, with a total tonnage of 8,054 tons, arrived in Hamburg from the West Coast, and 98 vessels, of which 48 were German, of 25,674 tons left Hamburg, and none were steamers. In 1888 there were 63 vessels inwards, 34 being German, of a gross tonnage of 67,446 tons, and 89 outwards, 59 being German, of a gross tonnage of 72,885 tons. Of the inward vessels 54, and of the outward 59 were steamers. Thus in ten years the tonnage increased by about 400 per cent. Imports have increased far more than exports, because Hamburg has now become the centre of distribution for West African products.\n\nThe chief article of import is palm kernels, of which there were 973,405 cwts. in 1888, against 106,453 cwts. in 1878; in palm oil the quantities for the same years were 121,884 cwts. and 29,036 cwts., respectively; coffee, 11,109 cwts. and 96 cwts.; dyewood, 20,668 cwts. and 6,094 cwts.; india-rubber, 13,679 cwts. and 3,142 cwts.; and so on for less important articles. The total imports for 1888 amounted to 1,168,783 cwts., and the exports 1,121,605 cwts.; in 1878 the imports were 182,399 cwts., and the exports 495,660 cwts. The chief article of export is alcohol in one or other of its forms. The export of spirits in 1888 was 652,130 cwts., against 314,120 cwts. in 1878; the exports of the other principal articles for the two years were as follows: Rice, 90,778 cwts. in 1888 and 5,053 in 1878; beer, 16,479 and 2,919 cwts.; gunpowder, 86,320 and 10,844 cwts.; iron ware, 20,478 and 4,559 cwts.; tobacco, 12,048 and 2,784 cwts.; cotton goods, 11,053 and 3,110 cwts. In the non-European trade of Hamburg, West Africa comes sixth in imports, before Mexico, Singapore, Japan, China, &c., and next after British India. Indeed, it is nearly equal to the latter, which includes considerable imports of jute and rice. In exports the West Coast is fourth, coming next after the Argentine Republic.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained. For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Trade with the Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Congo trade returns for last year have lately been tabulated.

The average prices in Europe of the more important native products have stood even lower than during the previous twelve months, while the prolonged continuance of low prices in Africa has apparently disheartened the native producer, and tended to diminish the quantity as well as the value of his out-turn. In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos. Great numbers of clerks and artisans, anxious for engagements as heretofore at various parts of the coast, are unable to obtain employment, or only at reduced rates of wages.\n\nTo these communities 1888 will probably bring good tidings.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Similarly, The African Times provides substantial evidence of the extensive importation of palm oil into the United Kingdom, with detailed statistics from 1860 and 1861 showing significant reliance on West African sources. The articles also highlight the growing importance of palm kernels, initially considered waste but later becoming valuable exports to Europe, with frequent mentions of price fluctuations and market conditions in cities like Liverpool and London.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""The coast had always exported palm oil, but in minute quantities. Imports into Britain rose from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21 000 tonnes in 1844, levelled off for ten years or so, and then doubled by 1870. France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'European trading influence spread much more quickly and more widely than missionary influence in the first half of the nineteenth century. This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend.

Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': 'The economic balance sheet > The private sector', 'content': ""It was a far cry from the success of a firm like Lever Brothers which, starting with the first palm oil purchased in the Belgian Congo (based on a concession of 750000 ha from the SEDEC - SociØtØ des Huileries du Congo Belge, 1911), soon extended its oil plantation empire to the whole of West Africa (Gabon/Middle Congo, Nigeria, Cameroon).

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond.

Trade with Europe had existed before, but the nineteenth century witnessed a massive increase in the scale of this trade with varying effects depending on the structure of Saharan regional economies.

For example north of the Senegal basin increased exports of gum arabic allowed a zawiya lineage, whose members specialized in Islamic scholarship and the mediation of disputes and organized trading caravans to escales on the Senegal river to gain in power and influence.19 In the area north of the Sokoto caliphate the rise ofexports ofostrich feathers and tanned goat skins in the last thirty years of the century forced nomadic ruling classes to adjust to the new¬ found ability of peasants and servile agriculturalists to earn income from collecting and selling these products.20 European economic penetration also affected the tastes of consumers, so that the custom of drinking heavily sugared tea spread during the century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards. In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850.

The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually. Rubber, ground nuts, cotton, Guinea grains, and other articles figure for small sums among the Gold Coast exports, though it is admitted they might be greatly increased in value by additional energy, capital, and, above all, labour. It is stated that in the 17th century the export of gold from Elmina reached as much as three millions sterling in one year.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS COMMISSIONERSHIP', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

It is scarcely necessary to say here that we believe in that regeneration.

Palm oil has become the great staple of Western Africa. Taking into account the difficulty of access to the interior, and the manners and habits of the people, it must be admitted that the trade in this useful article has had an extraordinary development. Palm oil was precisely such an article as the barbarous inhabitants of a tropical climate needed to possess in the infancy of their commerce. The tree which produces the palm-oil nut is the most valuable of all trees to the native African. It grows spontaneously over large tracts of country. It furnishes him with oil, wine, vinegar, thatch, fibre, and fuel.

In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall.

Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement.

The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Although the data are fragmentary, it is clear that throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries an international network built upon localized trading provided commodities for the Indian Ocean ports dominated by Indian and Muslim merchant capital. Among the most important were ivory from the Luangwa valley and adjacent Undi territory, gold from the mines in the kingdoms of Manica and Changamire and just north of Tete, and copper from the Kafue region.$^{15}$ The scale of this trade seems to have been relatively small and somewhat irregular until the last two decades of the eighteenth century. The eastward thrust of the Lunda of Kazembe and their commercial alliance with the Bisa, the intensified activities of Yao merchants from the coast, and the commercial expansion of the Chikunda traders from the Zambezi prazos dramatically increased the level of exports to the Indian Ocean entrepôts. All three groups acquired substantial quantities of ivory and slaves for the world market, setting the stage for the progressive incorporation into the larger world economy, which was based almost entirely on the exchange of these two commodities for European manu› factured goods. 16 Transformation in the political and economic systems often generated parallel changes in the social and ethnic composition of Central African societies. The immigration of alien Shona- and Lunda-related peoples resulted in widespread intermarriage and even the emergence of entirely new ethnic groups, such as the Sena, Zambezi Tonga, and Goba.$^{17}$ The immigrants generally succeeded in imposing their core institutions and values upon the local population. The spread of the Lunda social mech› anism of perpetual kinship and positional succession throughout much of the region north of the Zambezi, for example, altered the basic structure of kinship and carried profound implications for the transmission of king› ship.$^{18}$ Of similar significance was the spread of the Shona Mwari cult and the supporting system of national ancestor spirits (mhondoró) throughout the southern tier of the Zambezi. The simultaneous introduction of the Shona language and symbol system in conjunction with the spread of Mwari must have fundamentally altered the cosmology of the indigenous inhabitants.$^{19}$ Culture change, however, was not unidirectional.

These covered a large part of Tanzania and, on a smaller scale, western Kenya. Traditional rulers who were able to control the trade were also able to accumulate the imported goods with which to build up a large army and to expand administrative machinery. Weaker states were either raided for slaves or annexed to form larger entities. In these areas the effect was either constructive in that it enabled certain rulers to build up bigger kingdoms in areas previously supporting smaller states, or destructive in the sense that it encouraged rebellion, which in turn destroyed the unity of the states that existed. Despite this generalization, the effect of the long-distance trade was generally destructive. There is no need to detail here the evils of the trade in human beings. But even the value of the material base built on imported goods was deceptive. Most of these goods were luxury items: beads, bracelets and other ornaments. What was useful was cloth, but even this competed with local sources of production which were eventually destroyed. Worse still, the trade in luxury goods and the general violence caused by the need to raid other societies in order to maintain the trade, meant neglect of subsistence agriculture. It is unlikely that the new structure could have been maintained even if colonialism had not intervened. In fact few of the large states built up during this period survived intact to the 1890s.\nIn order to illustrate this general picture it will be necessary to look briefly at the three caravan-route regions. In discussing the Kamba, we noticed how even their control of trade declined when raiding for slaves became prominent. The Kamba were a non-centralized society. The long› distance trade probably encouraged an enlargement of scale of various traditional institutions, beginning with kinship, village age-group and defence organizations. But none of these became the basis for a centralized state structure. In the whole of Kenya, only in the western region did the coastal trade lead directly to an enlarged and centralized political system.

In both cases alliances between local mer› chants and foreign traders facilitated the circumvention of the royal mon› opoly and drastically weakened the position of the respective national leaders.$^{68}$ A similar pattern occurred in the kingdom of Kassanje, located in the adjacent territory of Angola. There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks. On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

Subsequently, however, they used coercive tactics to satisfy the coastal demand. 34 Similarly, Yao itinerant traders initially exploited their access to cheap cloth and iron hoes to achieve a pre-eminent commercial position, but external pressures during the second half of the century motivated them to exert military pressure in the Shire valley in order to ensure their economic hegemony.$^{35}$ Makua participation in the slave trade underwent a parallel transformation while force had always been a component of the Arab-Swahili strategy. 36 To ensure a constant supply of captives and ivory, a number of trading groups carved out sizeable conquest states.

The people fled in all directions, but were pursued and captured, together with all their property; women and children, not less than men, being taken and divided among the different war men as their lawful slaves. Nor was it alone the people of this village, but strangers stopping on this part of the island, and whoever was helpless and defenceless, shared the like fate. Late in the afternoon of the same day Lieutenant Walsh, commanding the British forces in the Sherboro, came over from Bendoo and interposed for the protection of the people, and the arrest of the marauders. But in the meantime several canoes had left, carrying captives and plunder. Some of them, however, were met by the boats, captured, and brought back to Dumbuco. The party in one of them making resistance, was fired upon, and, as we understood, four persons were killed, and four others wounded. Of the remainder of the party, most of them fled to the bush and escaped; but quite a number were captured, and fifty-four, including some liberated slaves, have been sent to Freetown. Much credit is due to the commanding officer for the promptness and energy manifested in this affair.""\n\nWe find a repetition of the complaint that persons who reside within the limits of British territory, and who ask the protection of British law, are taking part in these country wars, in which they have no rightful interest whatever, and which are waged, for the most part, for the sake of plunder, and especially to capture slaves. It is to be hoped that the British authorities will severely punish all such offenders, who add the crime of man-stealing to that of murder.\n\nWe are glad to learn that a treaty has been signed by the\n\nprincipal chiefs engaged in the late ""Kittam war,"" by which there is to be free trade in all the rivers, except that the traders who sell spirituous liquors are to pay a tax to the native chiefs.'}, {'id': 2362, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST REVENUE, ASHANTI, &c.—LATEST INTELLIGENCE.', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST REVENUE, ASHANTI, &c.—LATEST INTELLIGENCE.', 'last_edit_date': '01-03-1873', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_01_1873#article-3', 'issue_date': '30_01_1873', 'content': 'Revenue.\n\nDear Sir,—In reply to yours, it is pretty generally understood that the revenue for 1872 has amounted to nearly 50,000l.

It is understood that negotiations are pending in regard to Bagedah and Porto Seguro territories; but no proclamation up to the time of writing has been issued with respect to them. Danoe has always been an eyesore to our Government, owing to its close proximity to the Quittah jurisdiction. Large quantities of spirits have been landed there during the past two years, and have been mostly smuggled into British territory. Recently American trading ships have been putting out large cargoes of spirits; and so jealous had these people become of our Government, that they made a compact with the King of Agbosome, and leased the land at an annual rent of S.300 (675l.). This no doubt has moved our Government to take immediate possession. Speculation is rife as to what the upshot may be in the event of the American Government having authorised these traders to secure the land on lease. Should the Government extend their boundary as far as Porto Seguro, it will, to a certain extent, enhance the revenues of Quittah; but they never will be able entirely to stop contrabandism till they acquire the whole seaboard between Quittah and Lagos.

Taubman-Goldie, Deputy-Governor of the Royal Niger Company, has also drawn up a document on this subject. The title of the paper is ""Alcohol and Civilization in Central Africa."" In estimating the services done by this Company to civilization, the writer mentions two as undeniable—the substitution of a considerable degree of peace for incessant intertribal wars, and the gradual suppression of slavery. With regard to their dealings in the matter of alcoholic liquors, he points out that they were confronted with these facts: (1) That traffic in European spirits had been carried on within the territories for half a century; (2) that the natives had, long before any importation by white men, manufactured their own intoxicating liquors; and (3) that the European spirits were consumed principally by the chiefs and more powerful classes, who would have driven out of the country any house which refused to meet their requirements. If the Company had refused to supply alcohol, commerce and political influence would probably have fallen into the hands of petty traders, who would have flooded Africa with European spirits, and yet not have carried on the great work of civilization. The Company adopted a middle course, and endeavoured to restrict the sale of liquors as much as possible. In 1886, the import of liquors had decreased by more than one-half in two years. Heavy duties were imposed on imported spirits. Smuggling was checked, the payment of wages in spirits was forbidden, and importation was altogether forbidden in the Benue districts. In a letter to Lord Salisbury, dated May 3, 1887, the writer summed up the case as follows: ""The Company would be equally willing to prohibit the importation of spirituous liquors into another third of its territories—namely, that lying on either side of the main Niger, above its confluence with the Benue, but for the fact that, owing to the very low duty on spirits levied in the British colony of Lagos, such a measure on the part of the Company would be rendered nugatory by the smuggling of spirits from Lagos into the province of Nupe through Illorin. The Council of the Company are aware of the difficulties attending the raising of the spirit duties at Lagos to the heavy rate levied on the Gold Coast and in the Niger territories—difficulties which arise from the adjacent French and German settlements levying no duties whatever upon spirits, which are chiefly exported from France and Germany. It may at first sight appear hopeless under these circumstances to approach their respective Governments with the view of inducing them to impose a tax on the import into Africa of spirituous liquors, but the Council think they might be convinced by the same arguments which have induced the Company—not merely from philanthropic, but from sound business motives—to discourage the importation of spirituous liquors; firstly, by means of heavy duties throughout the territories, and now by actual prohibition as regards one-third of those territories. I would venture to point out to your lordship that the evils of the spirit traffic have been exaggerated, and that all colonizing nations have an interest in extending and developing their general trade with West Africa, and that no business mainly based on the liquor traffic can be sound or permanent, or can lead to fresh requirements on the part of the natives, who are gradually becoming, through the trade in useful articles, more civilized, and leading more complex existences. While it is certain that the manufacturers of spirits in Germany and France would strain every nerve to induce their Governments to maintain the present system, the Council hope that public opinion in those countries would recognize the folly of sacrificing to the interests of a small clique the prospects of a large colonial development and of permanent and growing trade in useful articles. The Council feel that they may be liable to the accusation of stepping beyond their province in laying this matter before your Lordship, but hope that the great importance of the subject may be considered sufficient excuse. An arrangement with France and Germany such as is suggested above would admit of a uniform duty on spirits being levied from Senegal to the Cameroons, inclusive. Such uniform duty might be fixed at the highest rate, which would not make the inducements for smuggling so great as to defy preventive precautions. I submit, that with a uniform system extending over 2,500 miles of coast, a duty four times as high as that now levied in the Gold Coast Colony, and 20 times as high as that now levied at Lagos, might safely be imposed.""'}, {'id': 5849, 'article_title': 'Banquet to Governor Moloney', 'full_section_title': 'Banquet to Governor Moloney', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_06_1889#article-5', 'issue_date': '03_06_1889', 'content': 'His Excellency C.

The whole attack has come from the Hamburg deputies, who want to put pressure upon the German Government. The German interest in the West Coast trade is centered in the spirit traffic, and the attitude of the Niger Company is naturally resented. From a third of the territories under our control spirits are absolutely excluded; we have expressed the intention of prohibiting them in another third; and in the third near the coast where it is impossible to prevent smuggling through the creeks, there are high duties and licenses. The present import of spirit is insignificant; in former times it was four or five times as great. Pray remember that in this connexion, we don\'t claim to be philanthropists or moral reformers, or teetotalers, or even advocates of temperance for its own sake. What we do is on economic grounds. The liquor traffic tends to hinder the development of progressive trade and agriculture and the introduction of industries, and so we restrict it, and hope ultimately to abolish it.

In 1862 the imports amounted to £77,932, and the exports to £61,933; last year (1891) the imports were £607,718, and the exports £716,642. Lagos trade is subject to fluctuations, among other reasons, owing to the eccentric conduct of the middlemen from the interior, whose arbitrary demands and exactions have from time to time blocked the routes upon which the trade of the Colony depends.**\n\n""It is evident that in a trade which has its foundation on the barter system the value and quantity of the imports must vary directly with the exports. There is of late years a growing tendency on the part of the native, even in the remote interior, to employ silver currency for his transactions in place of direct barter or the cumbrous method of transporting vast quantities of cowrie shells from market to market. Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods. The attention of the natives has been directed lately to the importance of developing minor industries. Among these may be mentioned the cultivation of cocoa and coffee, which has been taken up both by the natives and, in one\n\nFor instance, on a large scale, by European enterprise. Even more importance is now attached to cotton, which is cultivated in large quantities in the interior of Yoruba for home manufacture. During the current year one of the obstructing tribes who prevented direct communication with the ""hinterland"" has been forced to open its roads, and it is to be hoped that the shipments of cotton, which amounted to 379,300lb., of a value at the port of shipment of £4,825 6s. 10d., during the past year, will in 1893 be very largely increased.

It is recommended that an inquiry should be instituted by Royal Commission, or by competent authorities, of whom the Government have many at their command, into statements which have been made respecting the trade in spirits with West Africa and its effects. These statements were made at meetings held at home and abroad in the reports of which, by the Press, it was noticed that hardly one substantial fact appeared supporting them: 1. That the Native races of Africa are deteriorating through excessive consumption of spirits. 2. That drunkenness is increasing in Native villages to an alarming extent. [Suggestion—That surprise visits should be paid to the principal villages and Native markets.] 3. That the drunkenness is due to imported spirits, and not to those of Native manufacture, such as palm wine. 4. That the imported gin and rum, &c., are vile and poisonous liquids. [Suggestion—That bottles be purchased and sent home for analysis.] 5. That the importation of spirits is excessive in proportion to population. And the Committee would recommend further: That the criminal statistics and reports on crime from the colonies should be investigated with the view of seeing whether they furnish evidence of such a state of things as described. The Committee deem it most essential for the present maintenance and future development of British trade with West Africa that there should be a more complete understanding and uniformity of practice amongst all the European powers ruling on the coast as to the duties levied on merchandise, including spirits. The inner boundaries of the colonies and protectorates, not to speak of those of mere spheres of influence, are ill-defined and generally unprotected. Merchandise of a portable kind can be carried from foreign ports where lower duties are charged and exchanged in the hinterlands of British colonies, in which colonies the duties are on a higher scale, to the detriment of the colonial revenues and British traders, including carriers by sea. Before a Customs Union was effected this applied to Togoland and the Gold Coast, and it may still apply to the northern rivers and to Liberia in relation to Sierra Leone, to French Benin in relation to Lagos, and to the Cameroons and Niger Territories in relation to the Niger Coast Protectorate.

This is explained by the returns, which show that the year 1889 was an exceptionally bad one for trade. The previous year had been a very good business one, and merchants were induced to increase their importations, in the belief that the succeeding year would prove as good as its predecessor; but the closing in the early part of the year of a principal exit for cotton goods completely disappointed their hopes, and left heavy stocks on their hands.

This is due to the increased importation of spirits, which exceeds the two former years by 262,115 gallons. The revenue derived from these spirits—which only include gin and rum for home consumption—exceeds £27,000 per annum. Palm oil shows a decided, steady decline in production. The heaviest decline was in 1887, when it fell 591,392 gallons below the quantity exported the previous year, and has continued to decrease ever since. The difference between the quantity exported in 1886 and 1889 is 788,527 gallons—equal to a local value of £39,426—a very material decrease in four years of one of the principal exports. Palm kernels show a gradual increase from 1886 to 1888, but in 1889 fell considerably below the quantity exported during any of the three previous years, and was less than 1888 by 10,810 tons. The total decrease in oil and kernels for 1889, as compared with 1888, was £90,661 at the local market value. Benniseed and cotton show a continued increase in the quantity exported for the four years, which is a very hopeful sign for these products. The total increase in value of these products in 1889 above 1888 is £5,840, which acts somewhat as a set-off against the decrease in oil and kernels. Cocoa shows a decrease of nearly 700 lbs. in 1889 upon the quantity exported the year previous.—*Colonies & India.*', 'last_edit_date': '1890-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Spirit Trade with West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A report has lately been drawn up by the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, and forwarded to the Secretary for the Colonies, in compliance with his request in August last for information on the subject and for suggestions to aid him in dealing with the matter, in view of statements made, to the effect that the promotion of trade in West Africa meant the promotion of trade in liquor.

Mr. John Holt presided in the absence of Mr. Alfred L. Jones, and welcomed Sir Gilbert warmly as a model West African governor, full of energy and determination, and far-seeing enough to have at heart the interests of the merchants, on whom primarily the existence of the colony depended. Naturally there were many points on which the authorities of the colony and the merchants were not entirely of one accord; and the trade were greatly indebted to Sir Gilbert for allowing them the opportunity of placing before him their views on many matters coming under his jurisdiction.\n\nThe chief subjects discussed were the recent increase of spirit duties, and the question of drawback on spirit imported for transit and transit dues; the construction of the new railway, its progress, the route chosen, &c.; the construction of costly bridges at Lagos, concerning which the Chamber had been in correspondence last year with the Colonial Office; the practicability of dredging the Lagos Bar and Lagoon; the question of the hinterlands of Lagos, and the result on the trade of the colony from the blockade of Ilorin; the possibility of establishing colonies of Kroo boys at Lagos, similar to that of Sierra Leone; the very important question of the water supply, the sanitation of the colony, and its health; also many other subjects that suggested themselves. Several of those present gave their views of the subjects in which they were interested, the questions of spirit traffic and issues raised thereby, folded woven goods, and adulteration of produce calling for much discussion. Mr. Holt said great credit was due to Sir Gilbert for originating the trade in rubber, which in two or three years had risen to above a quarter of a million sterling in value.\n\nHis Excellency, whose remarks were received with close attention, touched on all the subjects which had been brought before his notice, and gave much interesting information. He described the rise of the rubber trade in the colony, which had a somewhat curious history. It appears that a political prisoner from the Gold Coast was a most intelligent native, and thoroughly conversant with the rubber industry.

That these trading malpractices should be thus justly chargeable with the guilt of a devastating war, that must greatly injure the trade and revenue of Lagos, justifies us in repeating and intensifying our denunciation of that organized system of fraud, by which some of the Lagos importers play into the hands of those intermediaries, and assist them (as by their 25 yards of cloth folded to represent 30 yards) in their nefarious plunder of the interior people. Lagos is necessarily the seaport of a vast and populous interior, and it is deeply to be deplored that the development of the natural and industrial resources of that interior, should be hindered by practices which rob the producers of the fair and legitimate reward of their labour. If Lagos, enjoying the advantages of that security which is guaranteed by British power and British laws, is to rise to that commercial eminence which, from its advantageous situation, it is entitled to expect, it can only be by the full development of interior resources. All malpractices, therefore, which impede that development are criminal attacks on its prosperity, and ought to be repressed, as far as may be possible, by the Lagos Government. British law, we repeat, ought, and may be made, to offer a full protection against systematic fraud. It must be powerless, of course, as regards the malpractices of the Ijebu and Egba traders with goods which they may have removed beyond Lagos jurisdiction, but it may repress them within its limits, and thus inculcate commercial morality beyond those limits. This may be done, as already pointed out, by local enactments that, at least in so far as regards measures, goods shall be what they profess to be, having legibly and clearly stamped upon them, by ticket or otherwise, the measures and contents of pieces and cases on pain of fines and forfeiture. The Egbas and Ijebus are so strongly represented in Lagos, have so systematically inculcated the belief that they, and they only, are the producers upon whom Lagos must depend for its supplies of produce, and have so systematically held up the Ibadans to commercial reprobation as being entirely non-producers, mere armed plunderers, kidnappers, and slave-dealers, that Abandawaki has done good service in giving us the other side of the picture; and showing that Ibadan has already made considerable progress in industrial pursuits; that respectable Lagos native traders have established themselves, with their cotton gins, at Ibadan; that others, as Beckley and Robin, draw supplies of cotton and kernels from the same country; and that all that is required for putting an end to the old warlike pursuits of the Ibadans as a people, and turning them into a nation of producers is, that they should have full protection for the passage of their produce to Lagos; and be enabled to obtain its fair and legitimate value in those European commodities which are already objects of desire, and would be irresistible incentives to industrial labour. In view of so vast a field of resources for the trade of Lagos, we feel that, in addition to the enforcement of such regulations as we have already pointed out, it ought to be a settled and active policy on the part of the Lagos Government to do all within the fullest scope of its pacific powers, to bring about such an amicable understanding between the Ibadans, Egbas, and Ijebus, as may remove all impediments and hindrances to the spread of industrial pursuits throughout the entire interior territory, between the Lagos lagoon and Rabba, on the river Niger. Unless such an amicable understanding be arrived at by a legitimate and pacific exercise of British influence, there cannot be that permanent peace and security in those countries, which is an inseparable condition of industrial progress; and we may, therefore, we trust, be excused, even by the most sensitive official dignity, in pointing out to the Lagos Executive this path of honourable administrative exertion—in insisting that the most vital public interests require that the Administrator of Lagos and the Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, should not be mere apathetic guardians of existing trade, but active instruments for the pacific promotion of industrial development in all the countries within the range of their legitimate influence. The civilization of the West African countries must depend greatly on this, and the increasing wants of the industrial population of Great Britain demand it as an imperative duty on the part of those who are entrusted with power in the settlements and colonies of the British Crown.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1878#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Present Depression in all Branches of African Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'During the last twenty-five years England has acquired the sovereignty over portions of the Gold Coast which did not before belong to her, and Lagos has come into existence as a flourishing port, owing to the opening up of the Niger trade. With the benefits of British rule trade should have improved in this section of the West Coast, but with the exception of the growth of Lagos, which has been due to the opening up of the trade of the Niger, we fail to see any real improvement in the whole of the colony. The colony is dependent on customs dues for its revenue, and to pay the cost of administration, it is necessary that imports should be taxed. Foreign nations have trumped up claims to trading stations, to which a few years ago they attached no importance, and established ports close to our territories, even at times dividing one portion of the colony from another, whereby difficulties are thrown in the way of the British merchant, and his rival is enabled to land goods duty free, which, by a system of smuggling, compete with those which have to pay the dues of the British colony. The increased means of communication incident on the introduction of steam have largely increased the competition and enabled a fresh class of trader to enter into the business, so that profits have been cut down still more. The want of means of small native traders, and the laxity with which inexperienced merchants give credit, have led to many bad debts, which seriously affects trade. The English merchant without regular correspondents on the coast, and who supplies goods to those who write to ask for credit, should remember that many a man without any more capital than an envelope and a sheet of paper can write a business letter. A favourite ""dodge"" of these adventurers is to write for quantities of samples of all sorts and kinds, from a needle to a sewing-machine, from a biscuit to cases of wine or spirits, and thus gradually establish themselves as traders. The remedy lies in the hands of the English merchant, who should never ship a single article to any person in the colony unless he receives satisfactory references.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""As a civilizing agent: commerce is the mother of civilization, and has been, both in our days and in the earliest times, the grand engine by which the blessings of civilization and the treasures of knowledge and science are diffused.

It gives us new tastes, at the same time that it affords the means for their gratification; it enables us to compare our own laws, institutions, and manners with those of the Europeans, to profit by their example, or to take warning by their fate. Let us compare Lagos thirty-five years ago with Lagos today, and we have a striking instance of the potency of commerce as a civilizing agent. Lagos thirty-five years ago—ruled over by a despot, at whose nod a soul could be hurried into eternity; Lagos with its idolatry, its slave barracoons, its bush and miserable mud huts. Lagos of today—an emporium of legitimate commerce, a place of refuge for slaves, a centre of civilization; law, order, and justice, the rule and not the exception; the bush substituted for roads; in place of mud huts, with their thatched roofs, that fall so easy a prey to fire, we are having substantial brick buildings, with iron or slate roofs; the churches, the schools; the moral and mental improvement of the natives—are not these proof enough of the good wrought by commercial intercourse with Europe? Well, I will give one more instance. In 1873, domestic slavery was abolished on the Gold Coast. By force of arms? No! During the Ashantee Expedition, the English lost so many men that reparation was demanded and granted—namely, the abolition of domestic slavery.

Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods.

All export duties have been abolished, and the revenue will be derived from import duties. The import duties have, therefore, of course, been increased.

Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Economic zones and trading networks', 'content': ""They set up trading centres (e.g. Lukolele), went down the river as far as the Tio markets on the Pool, travelled upstream into the interior, collecting ivory and slaves, especially from the Mongo.

During the colonial occupation, administrative bases established by the state, as well as trading posts and mission stations used the same method to mass together captive populations as the canoe traders had done before them.\nThe Portuguese-African network was the oldest and most elaborate in Central Africa.$^{16}$ Changes in the map of its routes can be followed through› out the nineteenth century. In the first half of the century, the principal groups of tracks or 'corridors' led to Luanda and Benguela. Three large economic and cultural regions were centred on the roads leading to Luanda: the Kongo region with its 'Mubire' (Vili) network of tracks which passed through the Kwango chiefdoms (especially Holo) and Encoge, an Angolan fortified outpost; the region comprising the western Lunda states, reached either by crossing the territory of the Imbangala of Kassanje and passing through Ambaca, another Angolan outpost, or by travelling through the Songo and Pungo Andongo country; finally, the Ovimbundu region, which maintained regular contacts with Pungo Andongo and the other Angolan posts in the Kwanza valley. The Ovimbundu highlands were linked to the coast by another route that led to Caconda and Benguela.

It was only in the nineteenth century, and even then only from about the third decade onwards, that Central, East and North Africa became inextricably linked by great commercial highways. These were the result of the activities of the Arabs, Swahili, Yao, Nyamwezi and Kamba of East Africa, the Arabs of Egypt and Sudan, and the Tio, Ovimbundu and Chokwe of Central Africa. The outcome of all this was not only the commercial unification of Africa and an increase in intra-African contacts, not only a tremendous increase in the number of African entrepreneurs, middlemen and traders, but above all the progressive opening up of the hinterland of Africa to European and Arab/Swahili influence and manufactured goods with the tragic consequences that have been referred to and that will be discussed in greater detail in Volume VII of the Unesco General History.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""Unlike the Roman Catholic ones, the Protestant missions sought tem› poral influence.

They spread arithmetic and spoken and written English among people who had long been self-taught. Specialists came from Sierra Leone to teach architecture, printing and medicine. Learning belonged to the people who attended the missions, and the advantages that came from taking part made them into a privileged class. But they conformed to a pattern already familiar to the local chiefs, not all of whom approved. Some, however, paraded a superficial Westernization in their dress, their homes, their food and drink and their way of life. The missions' purpose was to create a middle class in order to cream off an elite, which would then be trained on Western lines, and would secure and expand the twoway flow of trade to and from the coast. The spread of civilization would be an incidental by-product which the palm-oil trade, limited to coastal transactions, could not achieve on its own. 47 Thus the Protestant missions, very much of this world, took on the role of reformers, which included interfering in political and military strategy. The Abeokuta missionaries suggested to England the making of a road to the sea, in order to speed up the barter trade - and the delivery of war material. They invoked the technical help of British troops against Dahomey. At Calabar their influence in the city-states secured by agree› ment the ending of local customs that they considered objectionable. From their position of strength, the missions did not object to the rival intrusion of Western administrations, but counterbalanced it by siding with or against the established trade. Around 1850 the missions, together with the traders and the political administration, became involved in an irreversible process leading to an early form of colonial rule. The appointment of consuls with expansionist views went hand in hand with armed blockades and the establishment of protectorates.

Two were characterized by the important role played in them by Muslim traders. In the north-eastern part of the region, there were outposts of traders from Cairo, the Red Sea and Khartoum, who scoured the Bahr al-Ghazäl and the area south of the Vela. This network developed as a result of commercial and military expeditions sent into the Sudan and Därfür by the ruler of Egypt, Muhammad 'AIT. By about 1850, the Egyptians had reached the Bahr al-Ghazäl, where Egyptian, Coptic and European traders adopted the techniques perfected since the eighteenth century by the troops of the sultans of Darfur. They built zeribas, forts or just thorn-bush reinforcements which they used as bases during barter operations or forays. A European traveller, Georg Schweinfurth, accompanied some of these traders in the 1870s and left a valuable account of the Zande and Mangbetu kingdoms at the time when they first estab› lished regular contacts with Sudanese traders.\nThe Sudanese network had certain distinctive features, in particular the division of influence between state monopolies and private trade, the systematic use of force, mainly through the recruitment of local mercen› aries, and a policy of developing plantations for trade, particularly in cotton. These objectives and methods helped inspire the King of the Belgians, Leopold II, when he embarked on establishing a trading empire for himself in the Zaire basin.\nSince the 1860s, whole areas of the Central Africa region had also been incorporated in a trading network with bases in the ports and warehouses on the Swahili coast, in places such as Zanzibar and Bagamoyo, on the Indian Ocean. The Swahili routes which went into the region east of Lomami comprised two major groups of tracks.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""The great transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world did not occur with the late nineteenth-century partition by European powers. Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Delayed incorporation of eastern Africa', 'content': 'The eastern coast of Africa was also still relatively outside the capitalist world-economy.

The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves.

All three groups acquired substantial quantities of ivory and slaves for the world market, setting the stage for the progressive incorporation into the larger world economy, which was based almost entirely on the exchange of these two commodities for European manu› factured goods. 16 Transformation in the political and economic systems often generated parallel changes in the social and ethnic composition of Central African societies. The immigration of alien Shona- and Lunda-related peoples resulted in widespread intermarriage and even the emergence of entirely new ethnic groups, such as the Sena, Zambezi Tonga, and Goba.$^{17}$ The immigrants generally succeeded in imposing their core institutions and values upon the local population. The spread of the Lunda social mech› anism of perpetual kinship and positional succession throughout much of the region north of the Zambezi, for example, altered the basic structure of kinship and carried profound implications for the transmission of king› ship.$^{18}$ Of similar significance was the spread of the Shona Mwari cult and the supporting system of national ancestor spirits (mhondoró) throughout the southern tier of the Zambezi. The simultaneous introduction of the Shona language and symbol system in conjunction with the spread of Mwari must have fundamentally altered the cosmology of the indigenous inhabitants.$^{19}$ Culture change, however, was not unidirectional.

There are numerous examples of wars among the Chikunda bands, Yao chiefs and Swahili trading groups.$^{61}$ The dependence on European arms and alien intermediaries often left the indigenous trading communities quite vulnerable. The Portuguese, for example, exploited their role as suppliers of weapons to pressure the Chikunda bands to recognize Lisbon's limited authority over their territory.$^{62}$ Similarly, the Sena began to rely so heavily on their Arab allies that they jeopardized their sovereign status. 63 Even the powerful Bemba were not totally immune to pressures from Arab and Swahili traders. 64 Moreover, with the abolition of the slave trade, those classes or strata within them who profited from the trade - the aristocracy, merchants, warlords and landlords - searched desperately for new commodities such as wax, coffee, groundnuts, and vegetable oils which they could extract from their subordinates or acquire through commerce in order to ensure a constant supply of European consumer goods and weapons necessary to maintain their privileged position.

Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade', 'content': 'This integration of the vast area of the eastern African hinterland with the coast was not achieved merely by extending new trade routes from the coast to the interior, nor was it simply a result of Arab and Swahili penetration into the interior.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

The advance of religion, of civilization, and of commerce were all involved in the opening up of Central Africa, and it was on that account that they appealed to that meeting, and to the greater public beyond, to take into serious consideration how much had been done in that direction in the last twenty-five years, and how great was the promised harvest if they joined in the great movement which was now going on.

He said Africa was the most fertile country in the world. They had heard of the Spice Islands, but here was a spice continent. In Africa there was a great deal more produce than the people could possibly consume. As an illustration of how a trade might grow, he might mention that in 1875 the exports of India-rubber were of the value of 40,000l., in 1876 100,000l., and this year it was expected they would be 250,000l. The great difficulty was the means of communication, but all difficulties might be removed by systematic exploration, and the establishment of stations. The slave-trade was more horrid in its effects than any one who had not witnessed them could conceive. He had known whole villages destroyed, and 500 or 600 people driven into the jungle to perish of starvation or be destroyed by wild beasts, in order to procure 50 or 60 slaves. The slave-trade might be put down by opening up roads and systematic exploration, but it would require a long time to induce the people to abolish domestic slavery, which was so rooted in their habits that if a slave were freed to-day he would complain to-morrow if he were not allowed to have a slave of his own.

Formerly we believed that there were only huge deserts and barren land, while now, on the contrary, it has been proved that large tribes of human beings exist there, who are more or less in a state of semi-civilization. Important towns with many inhabitants are built upon the shores of the lakes and the banks of the rivers. The Sahara itself is not at all what has been described in unfinished and superficial observations. The movable sands, too, which were considered an impassable barrier, extending far and wide, are in reality only local; and generally the soil has a consistency and firmness which does not differ much from the soil of Europe. Soudan appears to be the most important part of this huge continent. Some travellers reckon the population at over one hundred millions. There is a large river, the Niger, which spreads over half its extent. The inhabitants are industrious, and the elements of an international commerce seem to be in existence there to a very high degree. Again, in surmounting difficulties, more or less considerable, this country can be approached from two sides, by Algeria and by Senegal. This problem has for the last twenty years filled the minds of many, and the time seems come to solve it practically. Two years since M. Dapouchel, one of our principal civil engineers, obtained permission from the Government to go to Algeria to collect all possible information about the nature of Soudan, as well as of Sahara. He was assisted by the wonderful narratives which had been published by several travellers, especially those of M. Daveyrier, by the accounts of chiefs of caravans, and by information he received from distinguished officers, who had frequently made expeditions in the South of Algeria; also by undertaking himself an exploration on the borders of the Great Desert. M. Dapouchel has been able to publish a very interesting memoir, which shows the possibility of uniting ourselves to the Niger by an unbroken line of railroad of 1,250 miles.

It is true that in magnitude and practical difficulties it is altogether thrown into the shade by such enterprises as that of the Congo International State, but it is none the less a really big problem, and one well worthy the close attention of English exporters; for a trunk line from Kimberley to the Zambesi would undoubtedly tap the trade of an enormous, rich, and a very populous area.

A great share in this work fell to Great Britain, and there were signs that the nation had now awoke to a sense of its responsibilities and was prepared to spend a moderate amount of money in the regeneration of Africa. As the result of treaties concluded in 1889-90, a portion of Central Africa was declared to be the British protectorate, and the remainder was described as a British sphere of influence, and placed under the charter of the British South Africa Company. That Company, indeed, had saved the situation. Through the action of Mr. Cecil Rhodes it came forward in 1890 and offered to assist in the administration of Central Africa by contributing towards a police force to put down the slave trade. In 1893, the sums supplied for this purpose amounted to over £20,000, and in previous years they were never less than £10,000. Almost all this money was spent within the British Protectorate, where the Company had few interests and no rights or privileges. In 1891 he (the speaker) was despatched by the Government to form an administration of the Protectorate, and was appointed to administer the British South African Company's territories under the charter. The Navy placed two light draft gunboats on the Zambesi and Shire, and later on a gunboat for the Upper Shire and two vessels of deeper draft for use on Lake Nyassa. But the most efficient and important aid was the recognition of a great principle—the association of the Indian Empire with the affairs of Africa. Her Majesty's Government sanctioned the appeal to the Commander-in-Chief in India for the loan of Indian soldiers to fight against the slave traders; and Lord Roberts allowed the late Capt. Maguire to form a contingent of seventy men for service in British Central Africa for two years. On July 16, 1891, he (the speaker) arrived at Tshioromo, at the junction of the Ruo and the Shire, and two days afterwards the first troubles with the slave-trading chiefs began. During the autumn of that year they fought several battles with the Yaos, and after a series of victories a great disaster befell them. Capt. Maguire had endeavoured to destroy the last two slave dhows belonging to Makanjira, but was killed in the attempt together with three of his men. Two other white men also lost their lives, and this misfortune was followed by the defeat of another portion of the police force by a Yao chief called Zarafi, when six Sikhs were killed and two white officers severely wounded. After this, however, the tide began to turn in their favour. The support they received from the mass of the Natives prevented the Yaos from following up their success, and ultimately the British force had a series of successes, culminating in the route of Makanjira, and the capture and occupation of his country. All this time the civil administration had gone forward. In three years the Trade had increased from £30,000 to £100,000, the number of European settlers from 57 to 265, the local revenue from £1,700 to £13,000. British coinage and weights and measures had been introduced, the acreage under cultivation by Europeans had increased from 1,000 to over 8,000 acres, and valuable coffee plantations were growing. A most marked result of the suppression of the slave trade was the release of an enormous amount of locked-up labour, thanks to the Natives having taken to regular work, finding that they were well paid by the European settlers. Much praise must be given to the Christian missionaries working in Nyassaland, who were assiduous in giving industrial training to the Natives attending their schools. The missionaries taught printing, joinery, brickmaking, cooking, and other useful trades, and if this good work is continued with prudence and assiduity the societies now working in British Central Africa would soon raise the negroes to a much higher level of civilisation. The speaker next referred to the part to be played by India in the development of Central Africa, and remarked that he had chosen three years ago black, white, and yellow as the typical colours of the protectorate—black representing the Negro, white the European, and yellow the Indian. He believed that the welfare of Central Africa could only be attained by the co-operation of those three races. The negro was endowed with magnificent muscular development and physique, but was clumsy and dull-witted; the white man was destined to be the governor and teacher of Africa, and must be at the head of all great departments and the initiator of all great enterprises; but between the Zambesi and Lower Egypt he could not hope to constitute himself a colonist, or to form an appreciable element in the indigenous population. He believed Africa, south of the Zambesi would some day be a white man's country; that pure-blooded white people would form the bulk of the population and the same of Northern Africa. But tropical Africa would never be the home of a white race, though it might be dotted over with little settlements on high mountains and elevated plateaux. He believed the Asiatic to be of equal importance with the white man in the regeneration of Africa. He could stand a hot climate better, he was clever with his hands and wits, though he lacked the initiative and the power of government. The results of the mingling of the Arab with the negro was in certain respects good, but he was so bound up with the principle of slavery, and so bigotted an opponent of European civilisation, as to be eliminated as a useful factor in tropical Africa; in fact, the result of European domination must be to drive the Arabs back to Arabia, and he looked to India to furnish the yellow element so indispensable to Africa. For centuries the trade with east Africa had lain in Indian hands, and they were now commencing to develop the commerce of Central Africa, and were well fitted for the work, being peaceable and law-abiding folk, industrious, modest in their demands as to pay, and able to work hard in a hot climate. As soldiers, he could not speak too highly of the Sikhs, and their chief value was in the way in which they had been able to infuse their own military qualities, training, and discipline into the negro mind. Wherever the Sikhs went the negroes would now follow, and in conflict with a foe white officers no longer found themselves abandoned by black soldiers. The development of trade with India would involve the employment of an increasing number of British Indian subjects, tracts of land now uninhabited might be offered to Indian emigrants, and the increased use of coinage and the absorption of rupees, might, in the course of time, assist in solving the silver question. In conclusion, Mr. Johnston spoke of the market to be opened up for British manufactures. The demand in Africa for British cotton goods was daily increasing, and with patience and timely expenditure the British Government had managed to retain vast districts which, if they had come under the control of another European Power, would have been placed under disadvantageous conditions as regards British trade.""}]","[{'document_title': 'The Congo and the Conference in Reference to Commercial Geography', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Now, I wish to show you how this reflects on commercial geography. In commercial geography we have to study how all the rivers, lakes, and all possible roads and canals may be made to lead to the benefit of commerce. Commercial geography means the study of geography in such form that commerce may be benefited. If Mr. Stanley had simply gone down the Congo, and said it was a great river running towards the Equator, and had never done anything towards bringing its commercial capabilities into view, that would not have been commercial geography. But the great work of the International Association was the establishment of stations to be ports of refuge for traders, explorers, and missionaries at different positions in Africa. Owing to the work of Mr. Stanley, this became the International Association of the Haut Congo, and now is developed into the Congo Free State. The whole gist of the establishment of this Congo Free State has been to develop civilization and commerce in Central Africa. I might say commerce and civilization, because if legitimate commerce goes on, we may be sure that civilization will accompany it. It is by the discoveries made by Mr. Stanley and the officers of the International Association, that we can see how this great area of territory may be opened. When I was at Nyangwe, nobody had gone more than few miles west of it, and it was practically cut off from the West Coast. Now Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza have found routes which, when opened up, will bring trade into the navigable portions of the Congo. When once you are on the navigable portions of the Congo, you can go up to Stanley Falls, and on to Stanley Pool, or you can go on to Lake Moero, and to Lake Bangweolo. You can actually get into the Chambesi, and, with very few breaks, this great water system is open. The Lualaba and other rivers there will all be opened to small steamboats, and it is by those that the commerce and manufactures of Europe will be spread over an area which is one of the biggest areas to conceive as a new market. Commercial geography finds that we have got this great system, and commercial geography says, How is this water system to be utilized? How do people carry now? Everything is carried on men's shoulders."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMANDER CAMERON ON CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Jan. 14th, Commander Cameron, in the Rooms of the Incorporated Chamber of Commerce at Liverpool, delivered an address on ""The Commerce of Central Africa."" Colonel Paris presided, and there was a large attendance of members and others interested. Commander Cameron, who, on rising, was loudly applauded, said: What he wished to speak about was the commerce of Africa, and what would come out of the Berlin Conference, and other events which were now happening; for the Conference could not fail to be of great importance to British trade. Tropical Africa, except in a few cases, on the shores of great water-ways, was scarcely known. From the interior the difficulties of transport prevented any profit except on the most valuable products. The first idea of the trader seemed ivory. India-rubber was coming into use, and before he left the West Coast over £20,000 worth had been exported from Zanzibar in one year. Many valuable gums and spices were found in Central Africa. Africa was to all appearance, until a few years ago, the happy hunting ground of Englishmen; it was only those who voyaged who could really compete with us. Now all these things were changed, and on every side they saw a scramble for Africa. It was our duty to know as much as possible about the resources of this continent, and how the future of Africa was to be controlled by the Congo Free State, which promised to be the outcome of the Berlin Conference. Very great results were to be expected, and he might mention that, north-east of Victoria Nyanza, there was a plateau which might be colonized by Europeans, and whence trade might be put into some of the great producing centres of Africa. The trade of the Arab at Zanzibar was carried out by a system of advance. On the west coast there was a trade carried on by a few Europeans. In the last century the Portuguese had an enormous trade up the Zambesi, and in Zumbo Town there were the ruins of a cathedral and a university which had at one time 370 students. There were two other towns of equal importance. The great difficulty in this trade was the climate. At a conference in Brussels in 1876, the idea of an International Association was sketched, and the King of the Belgians had set himself steadfastly to work to further this great idea of promoting the civilization of the ""Dark Continent."" Nearly all the people of Africa were traders; the cultivation of the soil was relegated to the women. At Nyanza there were enormous assemblies of people, some of whom came to market 15 or 20 miles, travelling against the current of the Congo. From this locality he had brought home nutmegs that were of the greatest use in commerce. From the same region there came wild coffee. There were enormous districts where any amount of rice could be grown; you had only to ""scratch the earth,"" and it smiled at you. At some of these interior stations whole caravans were supplied by small villages with wheat sufficient for a week\'s journey. The people of those villages were able to produce for from ten to twelve times their number with scarcely any labour. On the Niger we had utilized water traffic, and the Congo had a number of miles of water carriage which could be utilized. There was, at the same time, the great difficulty of getting from the coast to this system on the Congo. Various schemes had been proposed to connect Stanley Pool with the Congo by railway, and he believed that after the settlement of the dispute between France and the International Association, the French would construct a railway to Stanley Pool, or the Association from the left bank of the Congo, and they would then be able to have instant communication with the centre of Africa. Further south, the Portuguese were beginning to wake up to the value of their territories. They were now making contracts to construct a railway into the interior. It was their duty as Englishmen to look after that scheme. The region he was speaking of produced ivory, gum, cotton, and spices. The Powers at the Berlin Conference had recognized the International Association as practically a sovereign State. What they must strongly insist upon was free trade, and permission to reside and trade in the Free State. Another point was as to the mode in which future annexations were to be made. Annexations had been going on rather fast lately, and the Conference agreement was to the effect that when a place was annexed notice was to be sent to the other countries, and that people trading at such a place were to continue trading under the same guarantees as formerly. He fancied that would be simply that there might be equal rights to all nations, and people already trading in places which had no European sovereign might find their positions injured by annexation on the part of European Powers. In this matter, also, he thought that great care had to be exercised. Then they had to think of the great trade which used to pass down Egypt from the Upper Nile. The Suakin and Berber Railway was contracted for at one time by Ismail Pasha, but he was compelled to give up the idea. If that railway had been built, we should have had none of the difficulties in the Soudan which we had at present. He mentioned as a sign of the times that an Ambassador from Timbuctoo was at Paris treating with the President of the French Republic. We had the trade of the Lower Niger in our hands, but in the Upper Niger a great portion of the trade might be diverted from us if the proposed railway were completed. There was one thing which he must say, and that was that if we wanted outlets for our goods we must send proper and suitable goods for the people. The establishment of the Congo Free State would prove a benefit to English trade, but we must watch the constitution of that State, and, if there were any objectionable features in it, get them removed. In conclusion, Commander Cameron remarked that in a very large portion of Africa cotton of very good quality grew. He had specimens at home of cotton goods which had been made by the natives in the interior, and he believed that, as communication improved they would see cargoes of cotton coming to Liverpool from Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The trade between this country and West Africa is capable of almost infinite development. It is now announced that the British Government will recommend Parliament to grant a subsidy to a contractor who is prepared to lay and work a cable between St. Vincent and the chief places on the West Coast. We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMANDER CAMERON AGAIN ON CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At a quarter past 12 a crowded audience assembled in the small Concert-room to hear an address from Commander Cameron, R.N., the distinguished African traveller, on ""Trade with Central Africa."" Mr. Shaw Lefevre, M.P., presided, and briefly introduced the speaker. Commander Cameron said that the trade of Central Africa is now virtually confined to two things—ivory and slaves; and, owing to the difficulties of transit, the whole of the ivory is carried to the coast by porters. Owing to this, the Arab traders and others were compelled to buy slaves to carry their goods. Central Africa was naturally capable of becoming one of the greatest producing countries in the world, and, as such a producer, of taking a large quantity of the manufactured article in return for the raw material. At present the Arab traders from the east had penetrated about half-way across the continent till they were met by the Portuguese traders on the west. The cost of carriage of ivory to the coast was now so great as to absorb nearly all the profits, although a hundred dollars worth of ivory could be bought in the interior for a pound weight of beads. The mineral resources of Central Africa were very great, including coal in large quantities, iron, copper, gold, silver, and others. The oil palm existed over the entire continent to the height of 2,600 feet above the sea; and nutmeg trees grew wild. He had walked for 200 and 300 yards at a time through nutmeg groves, the ground being literally covered with the nuts—all going to waste. At present nobody knew their value; they sought only for ivory, and thought of nothing else. In order to develop trade in these rich districts, one thing was essential—proper means of communication must be established. There were already three great water highways—the Nile, the Congo, and the Zambesi. Of these the most important was the Congo, by far the largest river in Africa. Its mouth did not now belong to any civilized country, like the Nile or Zambesi; and whilst the journey by the Congo to the heart of Africa would be only 500 to 600 miles, the like journey by the Nile would be 3,000 or 4,000 miles, and on the route they would everywhere find the Egyptian traders in conflict with the natives. In fact, no expedition could now make its way into Africa from the north by means of the Nile except by means of armed force. From the Congo to the head waters of the Zambesi a canal of twenty to thirty miles in length across a level country would connect the two systems, and provide an uninterrupted water communication across the entire continent. (Hear, hear.) By means of the northern affluents of the Congo they would afford easy water carriage to the coast from other extensive districts. The mouth of the Congo had no bar, and was not difficult of approach. There were some rocks in the stream, but such as steam navigation would easily deal with. At one place there were cataracts, but a porterage of about thirty miles would enable travellers to reach the upper waters of the Congo. The Lualaba, which nobody, he thought, now doubted was the upper Congo, was a splendid stream. At one place he measured it, and found it 1,080 yards across, with an average depth of one fathom, but with three channels of over three fathoms\' depth; and as this was the dry season, it was clear that the stream was navigable all the year round. By sending out steamers to be taken to pieces at the rapids, and put together again above them, they could force their way right into the continent, and get access to Lake Tanganyika. Of course human porterage could not compete with steam carriage; goods would be brought to the coast cheaply, and thus one great blow would be struck at the slave-trade. Already on Lake Nyassa the Scotch missionaries had a steamer, and if they could only get steam on to Tanganyika, they would get command of the whole of that splendid water to its southern extremity. The King of the Belgians had been talking of getting up an international scheme for exploring and civilizing Africa. His idea was to form stations right across the continent, and so form a great trunk road; and as the continent at that part was only 1,600 to 1,700 miles across, it was quite possible to establish such a line of communication. Having ridiculed the arguments of those who would let Africa alone, through a sentimental reluctance to interfere with the liberty of the native races, remarking that there was little liberty under the rule of despots who in a drunken freak would cut off the ears and noses of their subjects, Commander Cameron advocated the establishment of a great company which should be upon the model of the East India Company, because no capitalists would risk their money unless protected from the inroads of others who would otherwise reap the benefits of their first labours and expenses.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'PORTUGAL AND CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""LISBON, Thursday.—At the last meeting of the Commercial Association reference was made to the importance of Portugal obtaining information respecting Central Africa.

One of the speakers suggested that as trade appears to be suffering from the fact that production exceeds consumption, it would be a good thing if capital was more systematically devoted to the work of distribution. We must conclude that some impulse to the distribution of wealth is needed; and a wider distribution of mercantile profits would doubtless be a consequence of the application of the joint-stock principle to mercantile enterprise.\n\nThere is a well-founded belief that the economic development of Africa will be a work of time, and that it is not at all likely to advance by ""leaps and bounds."" The fact is, that so far as the West Coast is concerned, experienced authorities have pointed out that the black man must be interested in cultivation if trade is to be permanent and African communities are to become large consumers of European manufactures. At the present rate of indiscriminate collection, the supplies of ivory must eventually be exhausted, the India-rubber and other plants be destroyed, and the whole country be converted into a waste. It is upon the interior that the interest of the trading and investing public is concentrated, because it is the region of untried possibilities. But the prudent ask whether, assuming the existence of vast stores of produce and favourable conditions of development and progress, markets can be found at paying prices for the produce which Central Africa may yield. It is a question of cost as well as of productiveness. African rivers are interrupted by cataracts from which the great rivers of other continents still only partially developed are free. It is true that the construction of railways is hinted at, but questions arise as to what will be the cost of such railways, who will provide the capital, how long before they become remunerative, and how many transhipments will be required; for it is conceivable that the mere cost of transporting produce to the consuming markets might prove greater than the price obtainable for them.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the recent meeting of the members of the British Association, in the Geographical Section, Major Darwin, the Chairman, had a good deal to say about the development of Central Africa by means of railways. The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West Coast of Africa and the Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following letters appeared recently in the Manchester Guardian:—\n\n""Sir,—During a recent visit to Manchester I found the members of the Chamber of Commerce engaged in considering the question of trade at the above places. I had some conversation with some of the Manchester merchants and manufacturers, and I found that there was a very great desire to open up trade in the River Congo. I asked, why? The general reply was that the natives on the West Coast were getting to know too much; one or two others said that the trade was so bad on the West Coast that it was thought better to open up a new place. I suggested that the interior should be opened up instead of seeking new places for the purpose of improving trade; that the merchants should assist the natives in developing the country by making railways into the interior; and that Lagos might be connected with the mainland both coastwards and towards the interior by bridges. The reply I met with was, \'Let the natives do it themselves.\' I said that they could not, but that they expected the English Government to do it—at least, to make the railways. On this point, no doubt, many of those who read this letter will remember the reply of Lord Derby to the deputation of West Coast merchants on this subject; and I certainly agree with his lordship that it is not the duty of the English Government to make railways for the benefit of the merchants. It is no secret that the trade in Manchester and district is about as bad as it can well be; hence the desire to open up new places for trade. But I do think that those connected with the West Coast trade would do well to give a little closer attention to the trade by assisting in developing the country, instead of abandoning a place which is capable of doing so much.

He said he met no English merchants, although he heard of them and of our men-of-war, as all the white merchants he met traded in slaves. This, if true, would point to the Spanish and Portuguese merchants on the Congo. Of the vast importance to the trading community of England of the Congo and Lualaba proving one, there is little for me to say, but I will glance over the principal articles of export. The Guinea palm extends, I believe, from the West Coast to here; india-rubber is abundant in Manyema; sem sem (from which much so-called olive oil is extracted) grows well wherever cultivated; the castor-oil plant grows almost wild; ground nuts the same; copper and gold are found in Katanga; cotton grows well, and of two or three kinds; coffee is reported to grow wild; ivory, it is well known, mostly comes from this portion of Africa; there are many sorts of fibrous substances which might be exported with advantage, and the various millets and maize grow in such abundance that they would form a profitable export; rice also grows most luxuriantly wherever cultivated. The only obstacles to a free water communication of which I know are the Yellala Falls and the rapids on the Lualaba, a short way above the Nyangwé; the Lukuga is at present obstructed with grass, but a way might easily be cut through that. The trade at present is, about here, entirely in the hands of Arabs, who, when in Manyema, live nearly entirely by plunder, and who take the wretched inhabitants as slaves to carry their ivory and other goods. The efforts of England will, I trust, be successful in putting down the slave trade by sea, but at present they leave untouched an equally crying evil, the internal trade, which is rapidly depopulating vast districts. In going round the lake I was constantly shown places where villages had been, and when I asked where the former inhabitants were, invariably received the same answer, \'Killed or carried off for slaves.\' The price of a slave is only 5 dolis (20 yards) of calico, while the hire of a passage is 5l from Unyanyembe here; so that it is far cheaper to buy slaves than to hire porters; besides which, no porters are obtainable in Manyema, and the whole trade there is carried on by means of slaves. The Arabs take with them a horde of Wangwana, or freed men, armed with muskets, and carry a few stores by means of domestic slaves; and the ivory, of which they obtain large quantities, is all brought by fresh-caught slaves to Ujiji. The numbers of Arabs settling in the country is constantly increasing, and they all have large numbers of slaves for domestic purposes, for cultivating their gardens, and for porters. Many of those employed as porters only receive rations whilst on journeys, and when not travelling have to live by plunder. Of the relations between the various tribes there is little to be said; the agricultural people seldom make war on each other, unless they get mixed up with the quarrels of the Arabs, to any great extent; the predatory tribes prey on all others indiscriminately, carrying off slaves, and murdering all who attempt to resist. The cattle they slaughter at once, and find a ready market for their slaves among the Arab traders and tribes with whom they are not actually warring. I am afraid that stopping the export of slaves, although it will diminish the evil in the districts round the Nyass, from whence Kilwa draws its principal supplies, will only exacerbate it elsewhere by causing many now engaged in that trade to settle in the interior, where they will become slave-holders and traders afresh. In conclusion, let me add that, in my belief, this internal slave trade will continue to increase until proper means of communication are opened up, and the country brought under the influence of civilization and legitimate commerce.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-05-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1874#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRADE IN BRITISH WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2.

Expeditions are rapidly following one another and giving us full information about the interior of Equatorial Africa. Railways and canals are proposed for the opening up of that part of Africa, and they will, years hence, no doubt, prove an incalculable benefit; but why should we wait for these costly works? Why not utilize the arteries already provided by nature for traffic with the interior? Northwest Africa is a market to a great extent as yet unworked. The markets of Sego and Timbuctoo, Hamdallahi, and other large towns on the Upper Niger are most inadequately supplied with British goods by caravans from Tunis, Tripoli, Mogador, and Senegal, and the carriage is so expensive that none but the lightest and most valuable can be imported across the desert. Now the French river, Senegal, though it drains the country for over 700 miles, is practically useless as a channel of commerce. It has a bad and dangerous bar. Ships have often to lie outside weeks, and even months, waiting to enter the port of St. Louis. Its channel into the interior is full of sand bars and rocks, obstructing navigation by even small craft for most of the year; and the tribes to the north-east of its head-waters, of Arab origin, are ferocious and predatory, living by plunder; therefore, commerce meets with danger and difficulty in their neighbourhood. About 180 miles to the south is the Gambia, which seems intended by nature to be the main road for commerce, civilization, and religion into North-west Africa. At all states of the tide, at all seasons of the year, you have a deep and safe channel over the bar; vessels of 2,000 to 3,000 tons can come in and anchor off Bathurst, and discharge and load.

For a long time the interests of West Africa had been much neglected, which makes it the more necessary now to miss no opportunity of preventing any further alienation of trade. If railways are laid into the interior the existing trade will be attracted to the cheapest route, and in this way we shall be able to counteract the efforts the French are making to divert the caravans from the interior to French ports. Although we have now been trading with West Africa for over a century we have hardly done more than touch the fringe of the Nigerian Soudan, and the reason is that the roads into the interior are little more than wide ruts through the bush and forest. This is particularly the case on the Gold Coast, where duties were increased, with the object of improving these so-called roads. If railways were constructed these difficulties would disappear, and we should soon see a large and substantial increase in our trade. Had railways been in existence the Jebu and Ashanti expeditions would have cost very much less, and probably there would have been no necessity for them, for with good means of communication it would be easier to maintain friendly relations with the interior chiefs, who would soon recognise that their interests were identical with ours in promoting trade with the Soudan. If the merchant could take his goods into the interior at a reasonable rate, he would find an unlimited demand for his manufactures, and the Native could cultivate his soil to its full capabilities. In this way a new market of enormous possibilities, would be created for British trade. We cannot hope for any great extension of our West African trade under present conditions, but with railways the possibilities of an increase are enormous, as we should then be put in connexion with an industrious race of people and systematic cultivation.

In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by highlighting the recent awakening of the financial world to Africa's vast resources, including its rich agricultural, natural, and mineral wealth, which had been previously overlooked due to the focus on the slave trade. The articles emphasize the untapped potential of Africa's interior, noting geographical and logistical challenges, such as dangerous caravan routes and the need for improved infrastructure. They also point out the slow development of trade, with British merchants being slow to seize opportunities, while German, French, and Belgian merchants actively expanded their operations.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'Another interesting economic change in the nineteenth century, also often ignored by scholars, was the completion of the commercial unification of Africa. In spite of long-established trade routes across the Sahara and across Dârfßr to the Nile Valley, until the beginning of the nineteenth century there were hardly any transcontinental commercial routes linking Central and East Africa or linking Central and North Africa. It was only in the nineteenth century, and even then only from about the third decade onwards, that Central, East and North Africa became inextricably linked by great commercial highways. These were the result of the activities of the Arabs, Swahili, Yao, Nyamwezi and Kamba of East Africa, the Arabs of Egypt and Sudan, and the Tio, Ovimbundu and Chokwe of Central Africa. The outcome of all this was not only the commercial unification of Africa and an increase in intra-African contacts, not only a tremendous increase in the number of African entrepreneurs, middlemen and traders, but above all the progressive opening up of the hinterland of Africa to European and Arab/Swahili influence and manufactured goods with the tragic consequences that have been referred to and that will be discussed in greater detail in Volume VII of the Unesco General History.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Central Africa in the fluctuating world economy of the nineteenth century', 'content': ""During the centuries that saw the gradual establishment of a system in which agriculture, stock-breeding, fishing and gathering were the main productive activities, a trade sector always existed in Central Africa, playing a more or less important role according to historical circumstances. Gen› erally speaking, the difficulty and cost of transport restricted trading transactions for a long time to a few major products that were much in demand, such as salt, iron, prestige goods (copper, raffia fabrics, etc.), whereas agricultural produce was rarely carried over great distances.\nThe rise of a world-wide market economy, which began in the sixteenth century, gradually affected the organization of economic life in everwidening areas of Central Africa. Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics. Nonethe¬ less, they all had one thing in common, namely that they transformed important aspects of the old African economic system, linking it more or less loosely to the world economy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy. The first long economic and geographic expan› sion of the capitalist world-economy had occurred between 1450 and 160050. In that period, no part of Africa could be said to have been part of this historical system. The period 1600/50-1730/50 was, for the capitalist worldeconomy, a period of relative stagnation, of taking a breath, of consolidation, primarily within the geographic zones that had already been included in the sixteenth century. It was still largely true at this time that no part of Africa could be said to have been incorporated into this system (with the reservations noted about the changing structure of the slave trade). 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Economic zones and trading networks', 'content': ""Finally, the network of the tribute-based economy terminated at such centres as the mussutnba, Bunkeya, or capitals of small chiefdoms or the markets of non-centralized communities. Such termini were centres of active transactions.\nA system of this type was characterized by increasingly marked contrasts between areas that monopolized profitable operations - centralization of large quantities of products, handling and marketing operations - and those where there were fewer opportunities to accumulate wealth. The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century. On the whole, the Atlantic slave trade, even the clandestine operations, died out in the course of the 1850s, although in the lower Zaire river area it survived outside Portuguese control until the disappearance of the last of the slave markets in Latin America towards the end of the i86os.\nDuring the remainder of the century, exports from Angola were limited to a few agricultural products (such as coffee and sugar) and especially, products obtained by gathering - mostly wax and ivory - though during the last three decades of the century a greater variety of exported products were gathered, such as wild coffee, copal, palm oil and, later, more import¬ antly, natural rubber."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""We have thus argued that the period from 1750 on should be seen as one involving the incorporation of (at least northern, western, and southern) Africa into a particular historical system, that of the capitalist worldeconomy, and that Partition represented not the beginning but the cul› mination of this process.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650. The numbers by 1750 were about triple those of 1650. 4"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Delayed incorporation of eastern Africa', 'content': 'The eastern coast of Africa was also still relatively outside the capitalist world-economy.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""The role of the European commercial firms has been assessed by many scholars, most of whom agree on the significance of connecting Africa with markets in Western Europe and the Americas.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

Some of the hinterland peoples were quite unaware of it. Some coastal societies destroyed slave ships and held their crews to ransom. Others had their political and class structure overturned by it. Others again drew strength from the authoritarian and exclusivist nature of the system, and in those cases black and white interests coincided in a flourishing business. Some African producers and distributors of exportable manpower did well out of this branch of the coastal economy and foreign trade. During the eighteenth century they bartered nearly 7 million human beings for approximately 300 million piastres-worth of merchandise specific to the 'Guinea trade', including perhaps 80 million firearms.

He stated that the continent of Africa had an area of nearly a quarter of the entire land of the globe, and it had presented greater obstacles to human enterprise than any other part of the earth's surface. Notwithstanding the many explorations of scientific people and travellers, both recently and in ancient times, of which he quoted several instances, the vast interior of Africa still remained almost a terra incognita, with its natural wealth undeveloped, and its mineral treasures unexplored. It had a climate fully equal to any other part of the world, and capable of yielding tropical and subtropical productions to any extent. Still, it was a lost continent, banished, as it were, from commercial intercourse with the civilized parts of the world. The most considerable part of our commerce with North Central Africa was carried across the Great Desert of Sahara from the shores of the Mediterranean. Caravans now performed dangerous and tedious journeys of many months' duration from Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis, and other ports to the kingdom of Soudan. Two thousand miles of sterile and mountainous country had to be traversed and hostile tribes encountered before the nearest market was reached. In spite of those difficulties, about three millions worth of British produce found its way annually from the North to Soudan, which kingdom had no less than twenty millions of inhabitants. The great importance of opening those regions to commerce could not for a moment be doubted, and Timbuctoo formed, he thought, the most favoured spot for such intercourse, situated as it was on the very edge of the Desert. His plan was to open a direct commercial highway from the mouth of the river Belta, in the neighbourhood of Capes Juby and Bogador, on the North-west Coast of Africa, opposite the Canary Islands, to the northern bend of the Niger, at Timbuctoo—a distance of about 800 miles. That would form the shortest route to the interior, and was within easy access of Europe and America, the mouth of the Belta being distant about 1,500 miles from England. The engineering difficulties were inconsiderable, since the physical formation of that part of the Desert of Sahara which had to be crossed favoured the project; a great tract of it, with an area of 126,000 square miles, and known as Eljuf, being a vast depression, considerably below the level of the Atlantic. It was bounded by fertile and populous regions, and inhabited by an industrious class of people, whose only commercial intercourse with Europe was carried on from Mogador. That depression was impregnated with salt, and it had, it was believed, formerly formed part of the bed of the sea. He contended that the climate, the geography, and the people were all favourable to the scheme, and if once the mouth of the Belta was cleared of sand, the waters of the Atlantic would fill their former bed; thus establishing a direct communication with North Central Africa within easy distance of our ports. Instead of a trade of three millions annually, it might be increased tenfold. The great continent of Africa would be opened to every wholesome influence, its vast resources would be developed, and the horrors of the slave-trade would no longer stain its history.

We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products. By-and-by, when they are taught, they will begin to cultivate the soil and raise products which are in demand in Europe. Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world. The chartered companies meanwhile will, no doubt, do fairly well, not making great returns, but sufficient to repay their shareholders for their investment, while developing and creating a great country and a large market for our manufactures. As to the demand for\n\nour goods, that is a question that need not trouble us. The natives are fully alive to the advantage of British manufactures, and they will take any amount. The demand is only limited by what they can give in return, and the offer of British goods is the inducement which the companies hold out to them to produce the wealth of their own country.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1888#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The other day we took up a useful little work called ""The Statesman\'s Year Book,"" professing to give a compact statistical account of the various states and governments of the world.

Upon the character of this region science has spent its speculations, and the exploration of it has been the hard work of ages. Africa, in fact, has been the world's huge problem. From Cæsar to Speke, the origin of the Nile has been mankind's greatest puzzle. Unsolved though it be, the attempts to trace it out have been of the greatest service. No longer esteemed a howling wilderness, or a death-stricken morass, the interior of Africa, from the southern border of Sahara down to our own limits, we know to be singularly fertile, and by no means insalubrious. The western shore, north of Walwisch Bay, gives ample evidence that a wealthy country lies beyond—a country rich in minerals and vegetation—blessed in all save the savage races that seal it up from the view of civilization. Going north, we find, near the equator, a tract of splendid hill-land, where the Cameroon Mountains reach to a height of 14,000 or 15,000 feet, and where the climate is so genial, that Captain Burton recommended its fitness for a penal settlement. Here we have come to the most remarkable part of the continent. Beyond the Cameroons extends that vast depression which intersects Africa, at a high altitude, from the equator to the Cape. Then, on the other side of the still unknown territory, we come to the wonderful lake-land, whose inland seas, fringed by the palm-growth of the tropics, are overshadowed by the snowy peaks, and embraced by the crescent arms of the mystic Mountains of the Moon. Here, in what may naturally be regarded as the hottest part of Africa, lying exactly across the equator, is a land which, according to Speke and Grant, is one of the finest in the world. Owing to its height above the sea-level, the climate is singularly pleasant, and is so far from being excessively hot, that Captain Grant walked through the whole of it in woollen clothing, and slept every night between blankets. 750 different specimens brought away by these travellers attest the abundance and variety of the vegetation there. All the necessaries and many luxuries of savage life grow without much effort, and the natives lead an easy and somewhat gluttonous existence, in the rank enjoyment of the many gifts of nature. From all we know, and that recent travellers have told us, the whole of East Africa, between Natal and the equator, bears the same character. Dr. Livingstone has found the cotton plant growing abundantly throughout the valleys and river plains north of the Zambezi. On this side of that river exists a country that is utterly unexplored as yet. On the map this region presents a blank, and a dotted line only marks the supposed course of the Limpopo as it goes to the sea. What is known of this tract, however, and by slow degrees it is being trenched upon, is altogether favourable. The large organised hunting stations which are now established in the Trans-Vaal, sending out yearly many detachments of trained hunters into the adjacent territories, are gradually opening up this darkly hid land, and we hear that recent hunters describe what they have seen of it in most glowing terms. They say that for beauty of aspect and natural fertility it exceeds any of the southern divisions, and the people of Moselekatsc, who rules as the emperor of it, are known to be in advance of the tribes on this side of them. Here, it must be remembered, is the ancient Sofala, presumed to be the Ophir referred to in the Bible, and to this day gold ornaments sometimes reach us through natives who have received them from that mysterious locality.

But there were other and equally interesting sights to be seen besides the purely industrial. It seemed as if a slice of North Africa had been transported across the desert and planted in the heart of Negroland. The scene inside a Hausa town which, above all, interests a stranger is the market place, with its busy throng of buyers and sellers. Many of these market places are attended by thousands of men and women. The whole extent of Africa seems to be ransacked to stock the booths and shops. Any detailed account of the proceedings of the expedition at the Court of Umuru could not be given here. Suffice to say that I was successful beyond my anticipations. The Sultan, in consideration of a subsidy, agreed to hand over to the National African Company all his rights to both banks of the river Binué and its tributaries for thirty miles inland, to give them an absolute monopoly of all trading and mineral rights throughout his dominions, and to make the Company the sole medium in his intercourse with foreigners. A few days later, the Sultan of Gandu, whose rule extends over the main river from Lokoja to near Timbuctoo, granted the same rights and privileges for his empire, and thus the Company were put in absolute command of the whole middle area of the Niger, and the whole of the Basin of the Binué. In considering these concessions, it should be remembered that they were granted by educated men, who thoroughly knew the import of the whole matter. We were not dealing with barbarians, but educated Mahometans, who thoroughly knew what they were about. Yet you would do well to remember that tapping African trade is not like striking oil in America, which some writers would have you believe. There will be no sudden gush. It will develop by slow accretions as the fruit of industry, foresight, and the spread of habits of labour among the nations.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-01-27', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1886#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following communication has been sent to us.

I think, also, from what I have heard from the Arabs here, that the Lualabas is the Congo. My reasons for saying this are fully stated in the letter and journal I am now sending to the Royal Geographical Society, who will no doubt afford every information on the subject. One important fact (if true) mentioned by my Arab informant requires looking into. He said he met no English merchants, although he heard of them and of our men-of-war, as all the white merchants he met traded in slaves. This, if true, would point to the Spanish and Portuguese merchants on the Congo. Of the vast importance to the trading community of England of the Congo and Lualaba proving one, there is little for me to say, but I will glance over the principal articles of export. The Guinea palm extends, I believe, from the West Coast to here; india-rubber is abundant in Manyema; sem sem (from which much so-called olive oil is extracted) grows well wherever cultivated; the castor-oil plant grows almost wild; ground nuts the same; copper and gold are found in Katanga; cotton grows well, and of two or three kinds; coffee is reported to grow wild; ivory, it is well known, mostly comes from this portion of Africa; there are many sorts of fibrous substances which might be exported with advantage, and the various millets and maize grow in such abundance that they would form a profitable export; rice also grows most luxuriantly wherever cultivated. The only obstacles to a free water communication of which I know are the Yellala Falls and the rapids on the Lualaba, a short way above the Nyangwé; the Lukuga is at present obstructed with grass, but a way might easily be cut through that. The trade at present is, about here, entirely in the hands of Arabs, who, when in Manyema, live nearly entirely by plunder, and who take the wretched inhabitants as slaves to carry their ivory and other goods. The efforts of England will, I trust, be successful in putting down the slave trade by sea, but at present they leave untouched an equally crying evil, the internal trade, which is rapidly depopulating vast districts. In going round the lake I was constantly shown places where villages had been, and when I asked where the former inhabitants were, invariably received the same answer, \'Killed or carried off for slaves.\' The price of a slave is only 5 dolis (20 yards) of calico, while the hire of a passage is 5l from Unyanyembe here; so that it is far cheaper to buy slaves than to hire porters; besides which, no porters are obtainable in Manyema, and the whole trade there is carried on by means of slaves. The Arabs take with them a horde of Wangwana, or freed men, armed with muskets, and carry a few stores by means of domestic slaves; and the ivory, of which they obtain large quantities, is all brought by fresh-caught slaves to Ujiji. The numbers of Arabs settling in the country is constantly increasing, and they all have large numbers of slaves for domestic purposes, for cultivating their gardens, and for porters. Many of those employed as porters only receive rations whilst on journeys, and when not travelling have to live by plunder. Of the relations between the various tribes there is little to be said; the agricultural people seldom make war on each other, unless they get mixed up with the quarrels of the Arabs, to any great extent; the predatory tribes prey on all others indiscriminately, carrying off slaves, and murdering all who attempt to resist. The cattle they slaughter at once, and find a ready market for their slaves among the Arab traders and tribes with whom they are not actually warring. I am afraid that stopping the export of slaves, although it will diminish the evil in the districts round the Nyass, from whence Kilwa draws its principal supplies, will only exacerbate it elsewhere by causing many now engaged in that trade to settle in the interior, where they will become slave-holders and traders afresh. In conclusion, let me add that, in my belief, this internal slave trade will continue to increase until proper means of communication are opened up, and the country brought under the influence of civilization and legitimate commerce.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-05-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1874#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Possibilities of Trade with Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A correspondent of the _Times_, writing under the pseudonym of a ""Member of Committee, Section G, Birmingham,"" has addressed a long and interesting letter to that journal, dealing with the commercial prospects of Africa, some of the chief points of which we lay before our readers:—\n\nTo no land is the remark, ""When new markets present themselves we hear only of the difficulties of the country, the opposition of its people, or the rights of other Europeans,"" more pertinent than to the continent of Africa.

For long years travellers have spoken of the interior climate as only comparatively healthy; yet the very worst coast climate in Africa is as good, if not better than that of Panama. In the Geographical Section of the British Association this year Mr. Joseph Thomson referred to geographical travel as the handmaid of commerce. But if all travellers are to unite in condemning the climate, why prosecute the matter further? Yet most African travellers stultify their condemnation of the climate by continuing to be strong, healthy, robust-looking men. During a seven years\' residence I never lost a man. Though not a doctor, I have been called upon to doctor the doctors in the very few instances where they were to be found—in Her Majesty\'s ships of war—especially when visiting the oil rivers. For nearly 400 years England has traded with the African seaboard, but she never seems to get any further, except in the one brilliant instance of the Royal Niger Company.\n\nMr. Freshfield, one of the Secretaries of the Royal Geographical Society, has drawn attention to the fact that Algiers can be reached in four days from London.

Trade journals speak of the opening and developing of China and Japan by railways, but far better conditions exist nearer home, in Africa. Once open Central Africa to a people always on the move, and always trading, from the King to the peasant, and I undertake to say such a railway will pay as well as any.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples.

There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""As long as Africa was 'outside' the world-economy, the 'cost' of a slave to the slave-owner was the expense of procurement plus maintenance plus supervision (prorated for his/her life as a slave) divided by total work output during his/her life as a slave. The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy. The first long economic and geographic expan› sion of the capitalist world-economy had occurred between 1450 and 160050. In that period, no part of Africa could be said to have been part of this historical system. The period 1600/50-1730/50 was, for the capitalist worldeconomy, a period of relative stagnation, of taking a breath, of consolidation, primarily within the geographic zones that had already been included in the sixteenth century.

If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them.

The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process.

I feel identified with the coloured race by my five years' imprisonment in Missouri, on account of my love of the slave, and by my six years' residence in West Africa, where I laboured hard and suffered much for them; and should probably have remained, but for the ill-health of my family—wife and child. We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

Among many other places, our steamer, the ""Kinsembo,"" touched at Duke Town, Old Calabar river. Duke Town and Creek Town, close by it, are situated about forty miles up the sea. Here I found that about 500 tons of palm oil were shipped every week, besides palm kernels, rubber, ebony, and other products of Africa. Now, Old Calabar is an exact reproduction of the Upper Congo in scenery and the character of its vegetation. From Bolobo to Stanley Falls, and up the Lunlungu, Ikelemba, Itimbiri, Lubilash, M\'bura, Arnrurimi, and M\'bungu rivers, the islands and mainland are covered with the oil-palm and rubber trees. Forests are draped with the orchilla weed; the gum-copal is so abundant that tons may be found among the boulders of the Cataract region, which have been washed down from the Upper Congo; the natives know where the largest deposits are to be found. This length of navigation, which has similar features to Old Calabar, is just twenty times the length of river that, in the Bight of Benin, contributes 500 tons of palm oil weekly. When developed to the same extent, this would furnish 10,000 tons weekly. We have also to reckon the ivory, no mean article of commerce, that could be collected from an area of 500,000 square miles, without risk; and also the ground-nuts, or their oil, which could be produced from the area of the Cataract region, where this plant is most in cultivation, besides valuable minerals. We have not reckoned the food products which could be exported within two years from the opening of the railway. In a comparatively brief time steamers departing daily from the mouth of the Congo could not convey the produce of the river and its immediate banks, provided always that the railways were adequate to transport the produce from the Pool. Without a railway it is lost time to dwell upon the products of that extensive region under consideration, as the whole of it is not worth a thought. Given a railway, and given that every enterprising soul is stimulated to carry on his business or industry on the banks of the river, assured that his communications are as easy as though settled at Sierra Leone, and that the Government which supervises him and his surroundings is generous and liberal, like that which the International Association is disposed to be, the conception of the future importance and value of this region to the markets of the world need be no great strain on the imagination.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL COMPANIES FOR AFRICAN TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It will be annihilated by an European desire for legitimate commercial advantage. Human interest, resting in Europe upon the strong fulcrum of human wants, is the mighty lever that God has clearly ordained for lifting the great continent of Africa to the position she has been endowed for. She has passed rapidly, though it may seem to have been slowly, through the earlier stages of her elevation. The epoch of more potent effort has now arrived. Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it. Just as powerful European organizations prosecuted the slave-trade in Africa which individual cupidity desultorily commenced, and thus gave to that accursed traffic the enormous development to which it attained, so will powerful European organizations now take the field in giving development to that legitimate commerce for which Africa possesses so many rich and copious elements. A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array. Companies with too restricted capital can only do the same sort of work that individual merchants have been and are performing. This was and is useful enough for Africa, and beneficial to the merchant, as far as it can prudently go. But Africa now wants more than this. She wants powerful companies, that shall prudently but boldly stimulate and assist her to a much higher and more extensive industrial development. The Company of African Merchants is, and is intended to be, such an one. That it will open to England the great national storehouses of African cotton, we have no doubt; while it will be at the same time be helping forward and reaping other portions of its harvests in the long-opened fields of oils, gums, and other such articles of African produce. We long to see it, and we hope that we shall see it and kindred efficient organizations, take hold of certain richly-endowed districts of Africa with a firm and solid grasp—with a determination to squeeze from them their abundant natural stores, enriching them and elevating them morally and socially in the process—with a firm resolve to employ all those wealth-creating means which advancing civilization in Europe has gradually discovered and applied for stimulating industry and diffusing wealth, comfort, peace, and happiness, among mankind.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL COMPANIES FOR AFRICAN TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""But we felt that such great results as these—results of such vital importance to England, as well as for Africa—would be indefinitely postponed, if a mere peddling and irregular trade only was established there.

Africa has given good crops to the little silver sickles that have been thrust into her rich fields of produce. But to reap her great harvests, she wants what has been wanted everywhere for the like purpose—a heavy golden scythe, that shall mow down her abundant crops. Unless we are greatly mistaken, we have obtained this for the Niger and Chadda and other rich districts in the Company of African Merchants. We look to India—the East Indies—and contemplate what a rich and powerful company did there for a land and people torn in pieces by intestine feuds, and poor in the midst of wealth. The past of other countries has been preparing the future of that Africa which has been for centuries engaged in aiming incessant blows within herself at the very principle of vitality in nations—at the very foundation of all territorial wealth—the human life with which she so abounded. Africa may be said to have done nothing as regards her own future benefit, save to make universal and incessant efforts to retard and to prevent it. She has not laboured at all to build up the structure of her future greatness. She might have done so, had not the Christian nations of Europe assisted the followers of Mahomet in setting every man's hand against his brother for gain, throughout the whole length and breadth of the continent. Thenceforward she became an active agent in her own debasement. And well she has laboured in the work, gathering continually harvests of misery and woe. British repentance, first ardently preached by Clarkson, Buxton, Wilberforce, and kindred spirits, terminated the long era of her continuously-advancing degradation. A new one commenced. Under it progress has been slow, but constant. If a nation be not born in a day, how much less shall a vast continent be rapidly lifted from so deep an abyss as that into which Africa has been plunged, and set upon the moral and industrial elevation where alone she can justify her natural claim of equality—physical, industrial, moral, and intellectual—among the great divisions of the earth.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern. Captain Burton has asserted that he knows nothing to equal the prodigious wealth of the land, even in California, or in the Brazils. \'Gold dust is panned by native women from the sands of the sea shore.

One of the speakers suggested that as trade appears to be suffering from the fact that production exceeds consumption, it would be a good thing if capital was more systematically devoted to the work of distribution. We must conclude that some impulse to the distribution of wealth is needed; and a wider distribution of mercantile profits would doubtless be a consequence of the application of the joint-stock principle to mercantile enterprise.\n\nThere is a well-founded belief that the economic development of Africa will be a work of time, and that it is not at all likely to advance by ""leaps and bounds."" The fact is, that so far as the West Coast is concerned, experienced authorities have pointed out that the black man must be interested in cultivation if trade is to be permanent and African communities are to become large consumers of European manufactures. At the present rate of indiscriminate collection, the supplies of ivory must eventually be exhausted, the India-rubber and other plants be destroyed, and the whole country be converted into a waste. It is upon the interior that the interest of the trading and investing public is concentrated, because it is the region of untried possibilities. But the prudent ask whether, assuming the existence of vast stores of produce and favourable conditions of development and progress, markets can be found at paying prices for the produce which Central Africa may yield. It is a question of cost as well as of productiveness. African rivers are interrupted by cataracts from which the great rivers of other continents still only partially developed are free. It is true that the construction of railways is hinted at, but questions arise as to what will be the cost of such railways, who will provide the capital, how long before they become remunerative, and how many transhipments will be required; for it is conceivable that the mere cost of transporting produce to the consuming markets might prove greater than the price obtainable for them.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What the Royal Niger Company is Doing for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It should be borne in mind by those who look for quick and fabulous returns from their investments that Africa occupies a singular position.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products. By-and-by, when they are taught, they will begin to cultivate the soil and raise products which are in demand in Europe. Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world. The chartered companies meanwhile will, no doubt, do fairly well, not making great returns, but sufficient to repay their shareholders for their investment, while developing and creating a great country and a large market for our manufactures. As to the demand for\n\nour goods, that is a question that need not trouble us. The natives are fully alive to the advantage of British manufactures, and they will take any amount.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry.

The General History of Africa highlights the importance of developing natural resources, exemplified by Firestone's investment in rubber plantations, which became a major export commodity for Liberia. This underscores the potential for economic growth through resource development. The reopening of the Liberian hinterland to foreign traders and increased exports following the re-entry of Germans into the market in 1922 further illustrate how opening more ports and facilitating trade can boost economic integration. However, the text also notes that Firestone's operations remained largely isolated from the broader economy, indicating a misalignment with local labor capabilities, and highlights the government's financial struggles and reliance on foreign loans. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize Liberia's rich natural resources, such as fertile soil suitable for sugar, coffee, and palm oil production, which could be developed with appropriate investment and infrastructure. The suggestion to open more ports and liberalize trade policies aligns with the claim, as it would enhance foreign trade and investment. The articles also stress the need for employment opportunities that match local skills, such as in agriculture and manufacturing, to stimulate growth. Nonetheless, challenges such as prohibitive taxation and reluctance to allow foreign land ownership are noted as potential hindrances. Together, these observations affirm the claim's validity while highlighting the complexities and obstacles that must be addressed to achieve successful economic integration.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide several details that align with the claim regarding Liberia's economic growth and integration into global markets.

Firestone obtained from the Liberian government the right to lease for ninety-nine years up to one million acres in Liberia to grow and export rubber, and Liberia secured a loan of $5000000 from the Finance Corporation of America to develop infrastructure including roads, hospitals and schools, as well as to pay her debts.$^{48}$ The loan, which received United States government support, greatly increased the influence of Firestone and the United States in Liberia."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': ""Economic and social developments and European intervention in Liberia's and Ethiopia's internal affairs, 1880-1914 > Liberia"", 'content': ""Some social and economic developments did nevertheless occur.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper.

There was self-government in the sense that the American societies were subordinated to the settlements and not the other way round. The inhabitants showed courage in an environment that was hostile both ecologically and politically. The land was not very fertile, and had been worked by archaic methods. There was no business and no capital, and free men's labour was expensive. But there were engineers who knew how to build in concrete. The settlements on the coast drove out the slavetraders and stopped the trade. The aim of philanthropists and colonizers was achieved. The second factor was the personal qualities of the people in charge. Their background was Anglican and English-speaking; they were well fitted for the life they had chosen, but they were realists; and they planted the seeds of a new nation.

Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long. A number of African as well as alien merchants rapidly entered into the competition for slaves and ivory.

Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results.

Her recognition by the United States, France, and Holland, who have followed the lead of Great Britain, in this act of justice and good policy, this resuscitation of African civilised nationalities from the Tomb of Ages, has placed her in a position to demand pecuniary assistance as a nation, if she can offer security. And this is precisely what the new Carthage on the Atlantic finds a difficulty in furnishing. She has an ample territory, because it is without limits toward the interior—a vast extent, therefore, of public lands—a soil of great fertility—an orderly, established Government—institutions that function well—all the elements, in fine, of future greatness and prosperity. All except one. In civilised population she is deficient. Consequently her public revenue is small—too small to allow of any portion being hypothecated for interest of debt. It is impossible to extract a large revenue from fifteen thousand people. And this is at present the sum of the civilised portion of Liberia. Under the Customs' Duties Act, which will come into operation in 1864, and through which the Government will receive import duties upon cargoes now sold along the coast without any payment to the State, the revenue will no doubt increase. But the increase, though important for general administrative wants, will do little, for many years to come, toward the great object we are now treating of—viz., the creating a surplus for payment of interest on a foreign debt. And yet, without the aid of capital from the great civilised nations of Europe, the progress of Liberia, as well as of other African countries, will be infinitely less rapid than the growing wants of Europe for tropical produce demand that it should be.\n\nNothing could be worse than to encourage vain hopes and expectations in a matter of this importance. We write thus pointedly because the want of capital for those improvements which lead to industrial development is keenly felt in Liberia; and the hope, we know, has found its way into some heads and hearts there that this want may be supplied by millions of pounds sterling from European capitalists. It is as well that it should be thoroughly understood at once how great the difficulties are in the way of the realisation of any such hope.

We do not wish to see Liberia an abused pauper upon our great money marts; but we do wish to see her obtain help in all real need. And for this she must go step by step. There is only one sure node that we can suggest by which she may securely advance. Let her wise men create some special revenue for public improvements. While raising this to a dependable five or six thousand pounds a-year, let examination be made as to which will be the most rapidly reproductive public work upon which eighty or a hundred thousand pounds sterling could be effectively expended. Let everything connected with such work be maturely studied—all the preliminaries towards its execution be arranged—all the reproductive elements and energies it will bring into play be cautiously examined.

They would have all the support we could give them. The money would be obtained; and, if the result justified the expectations formed from the work, not only would the same special revenue fund which paid the interest on Liberia's first public works loan be free for another operation of a similar kind, but a justifiable confidence will have been created, and a loan larger, perhaps, than the security of the special fund would itself warrant, might, no doubt, be obtained. Thus, stone by stone, might Liberia build up the solid structures of her future greatness.

The editor writes as follows:—\n\n""Our financier has failed to find out, it seems; that of all things most especially in systems of public economy and finance, no one nation can exactly use or adopt that of another. \'A system made for one nation,\' says a learned authority on political economy, \'and adapted to its condition and interests, may be ruinous to another—will certainly be more or less hurtful.\' So that in taking up his pen to advise on political money matters and financial schemes in Liberia, our financier should have, first of all, realised that he was writing of and for Liberia. Had he done this he certainly would have never advised in one breath the increase of Liberia\'s custom dues, and in the next breath a laying on of heavy taxes. The idea is too preposterous. Does he mean to borrow money for the express purpose of grinding the poor people to death with taxes? Taxes indirect in the shape of duties; taxes direct as his No. IV. argues. Certainly our financiering friend, though a scholar, has forgotten the old Latin proverb, *Ne sutor ultra crepidam*—don\'t let a shoemaker go beyond his last. What supposes he a direct tax, on the head, if he pleases, of each taxable man in Liberia, say of ten dollars per head, would pay? Now suppose, Mr. Financier, on a direct tax scale you charge every man ten dollars; with a voting population of 2,000, you will get twenty thousand dollars. Now what is twenty thousand dollars to a State whose legislative expenses alone scarcely ever go below twenty thousand? With judiciary, civil list, and other expenses doubling this amount, our doctrine is not, as our reviewer tries to show it to be, that Liberia does not need money. Liberia needs money as a State, and most of all she needs the operation of monetary schemes, plans, and uses within the country—such as extensive farming operations, large manufactories, banks, &c., through which the willing labour and energies of the people could find employment and adequate remuneration on the live-and-let-live principle. Throw employment open to the people adapted to their abilities and the peculiarities of their natural situation, give them opportunities to honestly acquire ease, competence, wealth, and you have shown yourself a public benefactor, a worthy writer on political economy.'}, {'id': 2157, 'article_title': 'The Cession of the Dutch Gold Coast Settlements to Great Britain', 'full_section_title': 'The Cession of the Dutch Gold Coast Settlements to Great Britain', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1872#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_02_1872', 'content': '\n\nThe preposterous humbug of so-called Liberian banquets, &c., has, we hope, at last culminated. While the African Times was printing last month there was being held what was grandiloquently styled the ""LIBERIAN ANNUAL BALL,"" seemingly, so far as we can make out, for the especial glorification of Mr. David Chinnery, in the character of his Excellency David Chinnery, Chargé d\'Affaires of the Republic of Liberia, and the Honourable Mrs. Chinnery! Mrs. Chinnery, of course, is not to blame for having the title of ""honourable"" improperly tacked to her name; and we merely notice it as an additional proof of the very questionable use made in this country at the present time of titles supposed to be derived from Liberia! We take it for granted, though we are not at all satisfied on this subject, that the appointment of Mr. Chinnery as Chargé d\'Affaires by the now deposed and imprisoned President Roye carried with it the designation of ""excellency,"" irrespective of whether Mr. Chinnery should be or should not be received and acknowledged as Chargé d\'Affaires by the British Government, to which it has been naturally supposed he was accredited; but which we believe we are correct in stating has never received or acknowledged him in that capacity. Even this, however, would not give the title of ""honourable"" to the wife of Mr. Chinnery. We repeat that we hope the new President of Liberia will exhibit the good sense of putting an end to what only seems to make Liberia ridiculous. A state with a gross revenue of about 10,000l. a-year, without (as Mr. Roye over and over again officially asserted in answer to just claims) a single cent* in its treasury, and unable to pay the salaries of its home officers, can only be made absurd by reiterated puffs of Liberian breakfasts, Liberian banquets, Liberian annual balls, &c. There may be new modes of making private fortunes, but there is no new mode of building up states. This can only be accomplished by the patient industry of their people and the development of natural, agricultural, and mineral resources. A loan, the annual interest on which is almost equal to the gross revenue, will not do it; but only serve to plunge the country deeper into debt and dishonour. Liberia ought not to have thought of raising money by loan until she possessed a surplus revenue at least equal to the charge that would fall upon her treasury for the annual interest thereon—a real, not a supposititious or purely imaginary surplus. Such an operation, if wisely conducted, is a mere capitalisation of the annual surplus; and, if raised without too great sacrifices, and honestly and economically applied in forwarding reproductive works, may often be very useful in creating additional public resources while increasing the well-being of the people. Liberia, without capitalists of her own, poor—we may almost say with truth, penniless—repels, instead of inviting, capital from other countries (except in the instance of the late most unjustifiable loan). She claims to possess a very large territory—600 miles of sea-board, unbounded as regards the interior, and is still greedily seeking to have her title acknowledged to other territories, such as the Gallinas, &c. Her immigrant population from the States is only about 15,000 to 17,000, yet no one can buy or own land, houses, &c., but an African—a Liberian. Thus she has made her bed, and an uncomfortable one it is; many of her population—we write of that immigrant population—starving in a land of immense natural resources, and very advantageously situate both as regards Europe and America. While the slave-trade was still in vigour, and before Liberia had been acknowledged as an African State by European Powers and by the United States, we can understand that there might be reasonable grounds for excluding Europeans or other strangers from possession of the soil. But, thanks to the indefatigable efforts of the now venerable as respected Mr. Gerard Ralston, so many years unpaid Consul-General, and who never aspired to be an ""excellency,"" Liberia has been acknowledged by every European Power; the slave-trade from Africa is for ever at an end; and even slavery itself is rapidly disappearing everywhere, except in the native heathen countries of Africa. There could no longer be any danger to Liberians in permitting Europeans to purchase as much land as they may choose. They would not buy more than they could utilise by their capital; they could only utilise what they might purchase by employing Liberians, by which in a short time many of these might be enriched, and many more be made comfortable, having their wants properly supplied by means of wages for their labour. Sugar, cotton, coffee, might be produced in large quantities for the European market, while it is notorious that enterprising men, owners of soil, having capital to work with, and with life and property duly protected, might soon double or treble the production of that great African staple, palm-oil. Europeans would never so throng the country as to be dangerous to the Liberians; and we see no other mode by which Liberia can progress than by welcoming them. With regard to the money lately raised by the loan in England, we now say distinctly and unhesitatingly—as we have before indicated—that in our opinion there is but one honourable course for Liberia to pursue. She cannot, with any regard for her own character, denounce and imprison the men who have raised the money for her and at the same time herself appropriate the plunder. She ought to restore to the bondholders all that remains of the money they have paid on their bonds, on condition of their giving up those bonds to be cancelled in exchange for that money, and for new bonds at par with 5 per cent. interest, for the balance which her poverty will not allow her at present to restore. Then, conducting herself modestly, without creating ""excellencies"" and ""lady honourables,"" without puffing English breakfasts, banquets, and so-called annual Liberian balls, she will soon become respected, and enlist the sympathies of the wise and the good of all countries. She has the choice of good and evil now before her. We have as above briefly indicated what she will become if she choose the good; but if the temptation be too great for her—if she cannot resist appropriating to herself what remains of the loan money, she plunges into an abyss where nothing can save her from contempt and shame.'}, {'id': 3126, 'article_title': 'LANDS IN LIBERIA', 'full_section_title': 'LANDS IN LIBERIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-17', 'issue_date': '01_06_1876', 'content': 'may help to develop the great natural resources of their rich and extensive territories. What has been already done by Liberians in sugar and coffee cultivation, and other branches of agricultural industry, is invaluable under these circumstances, as showing what an admirable field there is in Liberia for the judicious employment of capital under a settled government. There is a large aboriginal population ready for employment by those who may possess the means of payment for labour, not only in planting and securing crops, but in those indispensable accessories in new countries—the formation of roads, improving the navigation of rivers, and introducing that machinery which adds so much to the efficiency of manual labour. For all these accessories, capital realized elsewhere is absolutely necessary. Without that capital in the hands of the community, the government of Liberia has been, like the fabled Tantalus, surrounded by the life-giving element, but unable to appropriate it for its own use and safety. It has been suffering from a painful thirst of revenues which can only be supplied by the development of natural resources, and the opening up and utilizing land and water routes of communication with the interior, by means of which the produce of the soil may be conveyed with speed and at moderate cost to its sea-ports for shipment to the European and American markets. We are not at all sure that the Liberian authorities have, in the new laws which have been enacted, and which we this month publish, done all that is wanting to induce foreigners with capital to settle among them and undertake the cultivation and improvements that their country so greatly needs; but we feel sure that, having once entered on the right path, as they have now done, they will not be slow in supplementing these new laws by others that may be found to be indispensable for the realization of the important objects they have in view. We may possibly have more time fully to consider this subject in all its bearings before our next issue. Our only object, in any remarks we may feel bound to make, will be the good of Liberia and its citizens, which can only be effectively advanced by the removal of every obstacle that might deter foreign capital and intelligence from entering on that most promising field of labour which now invites them in this rich country of Western Africa, not distant more than fifteen days by steam from the ever-craving markets of Great Britain.'}, {'id': 4093, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1880#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_12_1880', 'content': 'Extract from the Message of President Gardner to the Liberian Legislature.**\n\nRecurring to the subject of the coast trade, while I would not be understood as advocating the doctrine of throwing open our coast indiscriminately, I do say we need more ports of entry to command a larger trade and an increased revenue.

Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast.

We wish our friends there would give us more ample and regular information of the progress and prospects of Liberia. We have a most sincere desire to help her in her onward march to a large development of her undoubtedly rich resources. It has, therefore, given us great satisfaction to hear that there are now on the banks of the St. Paul\'s River alone 458 acres of land under sugar-cane cultivation, of which above 100 acres have been planted this year. The estimate of crop which has been sent to us from these plantations seems to be, however, very low; so low, that we think there must be some error, unless a larger portion of the cane than we are aware of is of too recent planting to give good crops this season. The produce is returned at 307 tons of sugar and 160 tons of molasses. The plantation of one of our correspondents alone has produced 100 tons. We should have been glad to see the cotton industry well established in Liberia; but as sugar planting has been preferred, and as both soil and climate are admirably adapted for the cane, we expect shortly to find Liberia among the great sugar-producing countries. Natal—the account of this year\'s crops of sugar in which we published last month—should stir the Liberians to emulation.\n\nWe are glad to see that merchant ships on the coast, and the passengers in mail steamers, are subscribing, though not very liberally, to that admirable institution, St. Mark\'s Hospital, at Cape Palmas.\n\nOur friends of the Mendi Mission at the Sherboro, who have lately paid a visit to Cape Palmas, make the following satisfactory report.

Mr. Hoffman, they proceed as follows:—\n\n""But the tide of improvement in other respects has not risen very rapidly. Operations best calculated to promote the interest of any country have been sadly neglected, until within the last two years. Men of means preferred trade to the cultivation of the soil. The major part of the people have struggled in a menial way, while regions of soil as fertile as any in the world continued under the bush. But such a state of things is changing. The farming interest is becoming general; leading men are taking hold of the matter with determination.

PAUL\'S RIVER.—This majestic stream, with its banks, seems destined to be to the commonwealth of Liberia what the spinal column is to the human body. The wealth and strength of the country seem to be developing along the sides of this river. On either bank may be seen an unbroken chain of farms for the distance of twenty-one miles.

Every acre of land fronting the river for the distance above named is secured for agricultural purposes. Many are purchasing and cultivating farms several miles back of those fronting the stream. The people are becoming aroused to the advantages of agricultural industry. Coffee and sugar are now, and will be for a long time to come, Liberia\'s best medium of exchange. These products will buy what otherwise can be purchased only with gold and silver. The farms are not yet very extensive, but the excessive fertility and perpetuated fruitfulness of the soil, and its adaptedness to the growth of these articles, readily compensate for their contraction. Perhaps in these particulars the world affords no soil superior. Four steam sugar mills now operate along the river, the most extensive of which belong to L. L. Lloyd, Esq., of 35-horse power. This gentleman operates quite extensively, employing from fifty to sixty hands on his sugar farm, still he does not carry on as large a business in that line as some of his neighbours. It is said that Mr. Sharp manufactured about 60,000 pounds of sugar last season. This season he has a prospect of doubling the amount. Others operate equally extensively. Ten years ago, not a pound of sugar was exported from Liberia; foreign sugar was bought for home consumption; scarcely any attention was given to coffee growing.""', 'last_edit_date': '1865-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Liberian Republic', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The shores of this part of the world (Harper, Liberia) present a solitary and melancholy appearance. Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks.

Barclay, Secretary of State of Liberia, wrote as follows to Charles Hall Adams, Esq., Consul at Boston: ""In former years the volume of trade between the two countries (Liberia and the United States) was much larger than at present. Our palm oil and camwood were the chief productions exported to the United States, but since kerosene and cotton seed oil have come prominently to the front there, the exports of palm oil to that country have become almost nil compared with what it used to be. In those days it was not an uncommon thing for a single ship to take, among other products, palm oil to the value of 28,000 dols. to 36,000 dols. The vacancy caused by the decline of the trade of this article in the United States has not been filled. Your figures with reference to the export of coffee into the United States have been carefully scanned. We are entirely in accord as to the fact that our trade in this article might be increased to much larger proportions, and the quantity exported to the United States might be multiplied a hundred fold. Yet when the facts of the culture being in its infancy and of there being no banks nor other financial institutions to assist the growers, and no machinery, except in a few instances, are considered, I am of the opinion that our cultivators have made a tolerable good showing in foreign markets. The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs., which are distributed as follows: to Germany, 606,000 lbs.; United States, 301,000 lbs.; Belgium, France, and England, 149,000 lbs.; Holland and 150,000 lbs.""\n\nBishop William Taylor, in his Quadrennial Report, states: ""The productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous. Within ten miles of Monrovia, up the St. Paul\'s river, there are ten steam sugar-cane crushing mills, and during the past year more than 600,000 lbs. of coffee have been exported from Monrovia.""\n\nThe fact should be noted that, by act of the national Parliament of Brazil in May, slavery was abolished throughout the Empire. For years a popular feeling in favour of emancipation has been growing; but now the government has suddenly moved in the matter and the glorious deed is done. This act is one in which philanthropists and Christians may well rejoice, and it will have an important bearing on the interests of the kingdom of Christ in Brazil and in Africa. So strong is the love of ""fatherland"" in the uncontaminated Brazilian Negroes that there is a steady current setting eastward from that Empire, the ""expatriates"" paying their own way to West Africa.—*African Repository.*', 'last_edit_date': '1889-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Obstacles to Progress in Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—It is more than thirty years since I immigrated to this country, and ever since I can remember there has always been a sort of drag in everything. We are kept down in this place next to servitude; our will is not our own; a few men who are in command of a little property keep us knuckle down to them. If we are in their employment we are seldom paid in money, but are obliged to take up such estables as they choose to give us. If a captain or supercargo comes, and wishes to give some of the enterprising young men of this place a little trust, these merchants here, though doing business on trust themselves, will oppose it, and advise the parties not to give them trust. If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': 'In the 1870s, free trade was the slogan by which Europeans fought against the right of African rulers to regulate trade.$^{23}$ In the name of free trade, they sought more and more privileges for European traders. They encouraged African rulers to borrow heavily from European banks and dubious European adventurers. They manipulated servicing of the loans to acquire rights to the produce and to customs duties years in advance. They signed one-sided agreements for the collection of debts and enforced these and other privileges of European traders to weaken the economies of the states and even more the control of the rulers over the economy. In Egypt and Tunisia, they forced on the rulers international debt com› missions which greatly undermined the autonomy of the rulers, provoked riots, hindered reform and directly led to the loss of independence with little or no fighting involved.

Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Imports into Britain rose from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21 000 tonnes in 1844, levelled off for ten years or so, and then doubled by 1870. France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': ""market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in Africa was the ideological reflection of her worldwide hegemony, of those 'halcyon days' in which Britain's manufactures outcompeted those of all her rivals and her navy could enforce 'a freedom of access to the markets of the world unparalleled before or since.'$^{48}$ Britain's traders triumphed over all their competitors: over the Boers in southern Africa,$^{49}$ over the African merchants in West Africa,$^{50}$ over the French. 51 second partner in Atlantic trade, the African, if he did not play a decisive role, was nonetheless an actor in it, adapted himself, and extracted profit from the market, in short, behaved like a responsible party in the affair.'"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800.

Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Unprecedented commercial penetration from the East African coast during the nineteenth century resulted in the incorporation of most of Central Africa into the capitalist world economy. As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks. On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""The traditional compartmentalization between largely non-com› mercialized agricultural production and the long-distance trade in nonagricultural (luxury) products remained the rule even in those cases where there were small European agricultural settler communities, such as the prazeros in the Zambezi valley or the Boers on the Cape coast.\nThe one zone in which the economic situation was somewhat different was those parts of West and Central Africa where communities had begun to participate in the slave trade. The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650. The numbers by 1750 were about triple those of 1650. 4"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift. The Angolan coast was involved in a major way as of the sixteenth century, the Bight of Benin only as off. 1650, the Gold Coast as of c. 1700, the Bight of Biafra as off. 1740. The Sierra Leone coast, involved early, was a significant exporter only as of the middle of the eighteenth century. South-east Africa became a major source only in the nineteenth century. procedures for obtaining their quarry. At some point, therefore, production and political systems in West and Central Africa began to be adjusted as a function of these now continuing economic ties. When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Human interest, resting in Europe upon the strong fulcrum of human wants, is the mighty lever that God has clearly ordained for lifting the great continent of Africa to the position she has been endowed for. She has passed rapidly, though it may seem to have been slowly, through the earlier stages of her elevation. The epoch of more potent effort has now arrived. Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it. Just as powerful European organizations prosecuted the slave-trade in Africa which individual cupidity desultorily commenced, and thus gave to that accursed traffic the enormous development to which it attained, so will powerful European organizations now take the field in giving development to that legitimate commerce for which Africa possesses so many rich and copious elements. A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array. Companies with too restricted capital can only do the same sort of work that individual merchants have been and are performing. This was and is useful enough for Africa, and beneficial to the merchant, as far as it can prudently go. But Africa now wants more than this. She wants powerful companies, that shall prudently but boldly stimulate and assist her to a much higher and more extensive industrial development. The Company of African Merchants is, and is intended to be, such an one. That it will open to England the great national storehouses of African cotton, we have no doubt; while it will be at the same time be helping forward and reaping other portions of its harvests in the long-opened fields of oils, gums, and other such articles of African produce. We long to see it, and we hope that we shall see it and kindred efficient organizations, take hold of certain richly-endowed districts of Africa with a firm and solid grasp—with a determination to squeeze from them their abundant natural stores, enriching them and elevating them morally and socially in the process—with a firm resolve to employ all those wealth-creating means which advancing civilization in Europe has gradually discovered and applied for stimulating industry and diffusing wealth, comfort, peace, and happiness, among mankind.'}, {'id': 1002, 'article_title': 'Native African Customs.—Advantages of British Protection', 'full_section_title': 'Native African Customs.—Advantages of British Protection', 'last_edit_date': '11-08-1866', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_12_1866#article-18', 'issue_date': '22_12_1866', 'content': '## WEST AFRICA COMPANY, LIMITED.\n\n**Directors:**\n\n- HUGH BIRLEY, Esq., Didsbury, near Manchester, Chairman.\n- THOMAS CLEGG, Esq., Cheetham Hill, near Manchester.\n- THOMAS BRIGGS, Esq., Manufacturer, Manchester.\n- JAMES H.

Still, the dread of the knife is so keen, even among the bravest men, that its use is on all occasions regarded with something of distrust. Progress in medicine is, happily, yearly reducing the necessity of this extreme operation, and people are not without hope that it may soon be almost entirely abolished. In a number of cases in which amputation would have been necessary, the use of the knife appears to have been recently avoided merely by the use of a purely vegetable ointment. This composition, distinguished as the ""Lion,"" and prepared by **Mr. E. BURGESS, of High Holborn,** has won golden opinions from all sorts and conditions of men as a remedy for most skin diseases, old and poisoned wounds, cancers, tumours, ulcers, and other affections. Introduced to the public quietly, and without flourish of trumpets or bold advertisement, it has won wide popular favour, judging from a long list of testimonials now before me, by sheer force of its wonderful curative virtues. Instances innumerable are forthcoming of the almost magical disappearance of diseases of the character I have indicated upon the application of this ointment, and in cases, too, where the treatment of celebrated specialists had entirely failed. To residents in the up-country districts of the colonies, where, under any circumstances, medical aid can only be secured with difficulty, the possession of such an ointment is of the highest value and importance, while the fact that it is a well-approved remedy for stings and venomous bites must strongly commend it to such of my readers as dwell in India and the tropics.""\n\nOf all Chemists, or through any Wholesale House in England.  \n**AGENT: T.

I do not consider the news as reliable that he has arrived with Emin Pasha at the north-east corner of the Lake Victoria Nyanza. Still I believe that Stanley is making his way in the direction indicated, and I believe that at any moment we may receive intelligence of his successful return to the east coast of Africa. The value of Mr. Stanley's journey and the remarkable energy and courage he displayed, his high scientific attainments, and the information that will result from his labours are of the highest interest. The desiccation of the Lake Albert Nyanza, and its influences on the rise and fall of the Nile, is not the least remarkable of these problems. For my own part, I am of opinion that this rise and fall is caused by the growth of tropical water-plants. During the dry season this vegetation increases enormously, and at the first rains large masses of aquatic growth are loosened by the rising of the waters. These, in the form of floating islands, pass downwards on the bosom of the flowing waters, and on reaching a wide and shallow part of the river, such as we find at the Bahr-el-Gazelle, they gradually but quickly collect until they form a dam of sufficient density to obstruct the progress of the river; and the water thus arrested finds a temporary lodgment in the Lake of Albert Nyanza, causing it to overflow its normal boundaries. At length this dam can no longer withstand the pressure of the water upon it; a portion gives way; a channel is opened; and the river, hurrying on to the sea, overflows the banks of the Lower Nile and drains the lake to a lower level. This is what happens to the Albert Nyanza, which is nothing more than a huge backwater of the Upper Nile basin, and it accounts for the lake being seen at different levels by those two distinguished explorers, Mr. H. M. Stanley and Sir Samuel Baker, and hence the difference of opinion as to its true extent and size that has arisen between them. We know that this phenomenon takes place on Lake Tanganyika, as Stanley found a marked difference in its level on the two occasions he rested upon its shores. He also followed the Lukuga river from the Tanganyika to its junction with the Congo; and there is no doubt that a dam such as I have described forms at the point of departure of this river from the lake and prevents its regular flow till the weight behind it sweeps all away. During the second year that I was on the Congo we had an unusually heavy flood at the time of the first rains. The river rose several feet in one night, and some months afterwards news came from the Upper Congo that the waters of the big lake had broken through, and this no doubt had reference to the Lukuga river and Lake Tanganyika. Now, as regards the countries through which we have been passing, there are certain points of great interest connected with the science of applied geography to which I desire to draw your special attention. The first of these points is the study of the great railway systems of the world and the application of railways to the development of new countries. Take India, for example. What a change has been wrought, not only as regards the commerce of the country, but also in the social condition of its inhabitants and their manners and customs. The introduction of Indian wheat by means of these railways into the markets of Europe has caused a revolution in the trade of that commodity. We find this especially in America, where it has upset the calculations of those gigantic combinations or rings which sought to obtain a monopoly in the supply of this universal article of food. Thus the construction of railways in the East exercises commanding influences over the markets of the West. Although railways cannot compete with direct traffic by sea, when the necessity for more rapid conveyance of certain goods arises we find that a combination of sea and land transport is often adopted in preference to the longer route by sea alone. The development of any country, no matter what its geographical position may be, is enormously increased by the construction of railways. Take the Congo Free State as an instance. So long as the Upper Congo region, with its miles of navigable tributaries, was separated from the Lower Congo by the rapids extending from Stanley Pool to Matadi, this territory was practically shut to trade and commerce. Every piece of goods in the interior had to be carried on men's heads for more than 200 miles, and all ivory and other products were brought to the coast in the same way. Roughly speaking, such transport costs about £40 per ton. The Congo Free State has determined to build a railway of some 250 miles in length to cross this cataract region; and the moment it is completed the future of that country is assured. The King of the Belgians has kindly given permission for a Belgian officer of distinction—Captain Thys—to read a paper at this meeting on this railway, which will afford a more detailed account of this wise and patriotic undertaking. The discovery of steam as a motive power has brought the world into an extraordinary condition of contactiveness, and recently several new companies have been formed on the same lines as those followed by the old merchant adventurers. These later creations are being started under more favourable conditions than their predecessors, for they have all the advantages which modern science and modern appliances can afford. The English Government have encouraged and promoted the formation of these trading corporations. In countries where climate and circumstances of environment are not favourable to colonisation by white men, our colonial system of government progresses somewhat slowly. It has not the elasticity, nor the adaptability, to provide for the contingencies which must arise when a few white men maintain the position of rulers over large areas peopled by savage and uncivilised races. In the island of Borneo there is the North Borneo Company trading, governing, and civilising a large portion of territory with marked success. On the West Coast of Africa, the Royal Niger Company is developing the great natural resources of that magnificent river, and its tributary the Binue. On the east coast there is the Imperial British East African Company, operating in what is known as the British sphere of influence north of Zanzibar. Though not a twelvemonth has passed since they commenced their work, their initiatory proceedings have been remarkably successful, and there is every prospect of an early and rapid development of the territory committed to their charge. In the south-eastern portion of Central Africa, the African Lakes Company have fairly established themselves; and a new company is now being formed to open up and civilise a further portion of that section of the African continent. The establishment of these great trading and governing centres is likely to exercise most important influences. They are from their organisation and objects, better adapted at the outset to compete with and overcome the obstacles which present themselves to established forms of bureaucratic government; at the same time the Government of this country can interfere, in case of necessity, by the grants that have been made to them of royal charters, under which they carry on their operations. A wise control and judicious administration combined with the introduction of commerce and civilisation will, at no distant date, open these territories to the markets of the world, to the missionary, and to the scientific explorer.""}]","[{'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS COMMISSIONERSHIP', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

Well, if compensating the slave-holders meant atonement, then they might rest in peace. But where, he asked, was the compensation to Africa for the frightful legacy of crime and degradation they had left behind? Where was the reparation and atonement for the millions torn from their homes and the millions massacred, for a land laid waste, for the further warping of the rudimentary moral ideas of myriads of people, and the driving of them into ten-fold lower depths of savagery than they had known before the European era? For answer it would no doubt be said that ""legitimate commerce"" had replaced the vile traffic in human flesh and blood. Still the same old story—legitimate commerce—magic words which gave such a glamour to whatever could creep under their shelter—words which had too often blinded a gullible public to the most shameful and the most criminal transactions. They would perhaps tell him that every trading station, once the slave traffic was stopped, became the handmaiden of Christianity and civilisation, a beacon of light and leading, before which barbarism was bound to disappear. That was what he once thought the rôle which the trading stations was enacting in the dark depths of Africa, but over the greater part of the Continent it was not so at present, and had not been so in the past. He was there that night to speak the truth as it appeared to him, and it was this—that, taken as a whole, their trading stations on the greater part of the West Coast of Africa, instead of being centres of beneficent and elevating influences, had been in the past disease-breeding spots which had infected with a blighting and demoralising poison the whole country around. They had been centres of corruption, where men had coined money out of the moral and physical ruin of the tribes they supplied. This had been the result of the legitimate commerce that was to benefit the negro. What did they think had been the character of this so-called legitimate commerce? It consisted to an enormous extent of vile spirits and weapons of destruction—the one, to ruin the buyers; the other to enable them to slaughter their neighbours.\n\nThe lecturer went on to refer to the results of the gin traffic, which, he said, only received a more powerful stimulus with the stoppage of the slave trade.

There is of late years a growing tendency on the part of the native, even in the remote interior, to employ silver currency for his transactions in place of direct barter or the cumbrous method of transporting vast quantities of cowrie shells from market to market. Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods. The attention of the natives has been directed lately to the importance of developing minor industries. Among these may be mentioned the cultivation of cocoa and coffee, which has been taken up both by the natives and, in one', 'last_edit_date': '1893-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1893#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Outlook in the Congo Basin', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'These are the considerations which ought not to be overlooked. They are points on which exact information would be acceptable. An account of the products to be obtained, the cost of transportation, and the relations of supply and demand would be useful. In support of the application of the joint-stock principle it is argued that from the peculiar nature of a barter trade, increased capital means increased business without increase of working expenses. The natives are more and more disposed to bring down produce to the coast stations, and time is no object to them. Companies with large resources and independent of banking restrictions have many advantages in carrying on a trade which is necessarily irregular. The capital of trading companies should be mainly in the floating form, to be increased or withdrawn according to the opportunities for its employment. Besides, it is worthy of mention that there is a decided tendency in the direction of the formation of such companies on the Continent. Some of the Bombay mill-owners are endeavouring to associate, with a view to a combined effort to open up new markets. The commercial development of Africa is a matter of vital importance to Europe generally and England in particular, and we hail in the plan sketched here one of the most feasible and remunerative means to the attainment of this end.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the wake of every forward step into the interior of Africa rises a greater demand for the products of Europe. To supply the 1,500,000 dwellers on the banks of the Upper Congo, many cities in Europe must contribute the results of their industry. Like the coast natives, these can only be regarded as middle-men, or commission merchants, for the tribes in the far interior on either sides, to which no access can be had by water. Those possessing water frontage receive goods from the trader on the banks of the Upper Congo, and exchange them by means of caravans with the more populous tribes inland. The commerce of the Lower Congo in 1877 was principally in the hands of the Dutch Handels-vereniging of Rotterdam, Hatton & Cookson, of Liverpool, and Daumas, Beraud & Co., of Paris. There were also several small Portuguese traders; one or two trading in a modest way on their own account, but the majority were merely commission agents of the English, Dutch, and French houses, who furnished the goods and received the principal share of the profits in consequence. Since the advent of the expedition into the Congo, the commerce of the river has greatly increased; at least, the number of factories have been quadrupled. Every available point has been rented, and commission houses erected. As so many houses could not exist, unless the profits arising from the trade enabled them to do so, it is fair to suppose that the natives on both banks of the river had made increased exertions to meet the greater demand for produce.\n\n**ESTABLISHED COMPANIES RETURN GOOD DIVIDENDS.**', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The trade between this country and West Africa is capable of almost infinite development.

We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain and Portugal in East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '11. He also states that every foreign firm has to pay a £50 general trading licence and adds: ""Here, therefore, the law makes a clear distinction between foreigners and the Company, who may carry on the trade in question without paying for a license, having consequently an enormous advantage over all competitors."" This is a mistake. The Company as a trader is as much a ""foreigner"" in the Niger as any other merchant, and its commercial accounts are duly debited and its administrative accounts duly credited with its licenses. In no respect is the Company, as a trader, placed on any other footing than that of other foreigners. As to the amount of the license (£50), it may be pointed out that the German Consul was lately the temporary administrator of the neighbouring German colony of the Cameroons, where the license is £100.\n\n12. He considers it a decisive proof of unequal taxation or unfair treatment by the Company that three petty traders besides Herr Hoenigsberg (not Germans) commenced operations on a very small scale, soon after the issue of the charter, at Egga, about 400 miles from the sea, and withdrew after twelve or fifteen months; yet elsewhere, arguing against ports of entry, and not with reference to taxation, he urges that ""competition with the powerful and admirably organised Company is as good as impossible in the same locality."" Now, the Company, during the period in question, was unable to earn a profit at Egga. This was partly owing to local bad trade, and partly to the low price of shea (Bassia Parkii) in Europe. No petty merchant without a fixed establishment, and therefore free to move his capital to some more secure or more remunerative spot, would employ it without a profit in Central African commerce in hopes of future development or better times; so that the retiring of these small traders only proves that the Company, which is obliged for political reasons to maintain permanent establishments at Egga and scores of other places, during bad times as well as good times and at all seasons of the year, is pro tanto at a disadvantage with others who may come and go when and as they please. It is true that the disadvantage may be more than compensated by the admirable organisation to which the German Consul alludes; but this is the result of the accumulation of the experiences of many years, and has nothing to do with the charter or inequality of taxation or unfair administrative treatment. When the prices of African produce in Europe revive, or the volume of the Niger trade increases so as to permit the earning of profits adequate to the risk, numbers of small traders will, no doubt, at once enter the Niger, and, whether English, German, or of any other nationality, will certainly be welcomed by the Company as fellow contributors to the burdensome taxation necessary for the development of the territories and the maintenance of security, justice, and order.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL DEPRESSION ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The most unpleasant side of the question to me is that, after these inexperienced European merchants have so imprudently supplied goods to adventurous traders without securities, or worthless securities (and many a time without any reference to the Coast respecting the pecuniary status or reputation of the consignee), they are only too ready to brand all Africans as a race of dishonest robbers. A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

No such regulation exists. The Company, as a trader, is as much a ""foreigner"" in the Niger, and is subject to exactly the same restrictions as any other merchant. Disturbed districts may occasionally have to be absolutely closed for administrative reasons; though only one such instance—that of Onitsha—has actually occurred on the Niger since the issue of the charter, more than three years ago.

Trading vessels, including those of the Company, may, of course, only call where there are custom-houses. This principle is more or less stringently followed in every river where free transit is in force, as otherwise it would be impossible to prevent smuggling; but it is especially necessary in the Niger owing to the great number of creeks through which the main river may be reached from the sea, and to the necessity for preventing the smuggling of rifles, cartridges, and spirits. A free transit river, and especially where the revenue will not permit of coastguard supervision along thousands of miles of river back in a wild and malarious country, must be treated in this respect like a sea coast, where vessels may only communicate with the shore at certain points, although merchants and others may build, trade, or reside where they please on the land.

Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'. He fed, clothed and met social obligations of members; he determined the size of land and the type of crops to be cultivated each year; how much time to spend on the collective household farm (gandu; plur., gandaye), and how much on"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Delayed incorporation of eastern Africa', 'content': 'The eastern coast of Africa was also still relatively outside the capitalist world-economy. Its primary external links had been across the Indian Ocean. Still, India and to a lesser extent south-western Asia were now themselves being incorporated into the capitalist world-economy.

Nonetheless, it served there, as it had in west-central Africa, as a dynamic disruptive and recon› structing force.

But what precisely was the link? I. Hrbek remarked some time ago on the importance of the years 1805-20 in African history.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of Senegambia and Upper Guinea', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': 'The only factor common to the area in question during the period preceding the colonial conquest of Africa was really the advance of European influ› ence.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards. In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850. In 1895 trade by way of the TripoliBorno route suffered from the operations conducted by Rabeh, and the disruptions caused mainly by the French conquests in West Africa had their repercussions.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long. A number of African as well as alien merchants rapidly entered into the competition for slaves and ivory.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650. The numbers by 1750 were about triple those of 1650. 4"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded. In particular it seems that direct European involvement was counterproductive, as in the failed efforts at agricultural colonization in Waalo between 1819 and 1831,$^{21}$ and in the various efforts in Senegal, the southern Gold Coast, and Nigeria later on.$^{22}$ It was not that European personnel began to loom larger on the African scene; rather, the important change was that Europeans were largely displacing African merchants from The shift from the slave trade to palm oil strengthened the hand of private as against royal merchants (R. Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena. 'The bulking up, transporting and storage of commodities like palm oil and groundnuts, and the breaking down of imported goods into the quantities needed for many small producers, required more manpower than the trade in slaves'. See J. F. Munro, 1976, 47. the role of those in the port areas who purchased bulk items from traders who went into the interior and shipped them overseas, and vice-versa. 23 New export-oriented production necessarily implied new imports.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 252, 'article_title': 'General Observations', 'full_section_title': 'General Observations', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_11_1863', 'content': 'THERE is likely to be great suffering from drought on the Gold Coast.

The demand for kola nuts was reported to be at all times considerable in Brazil, but in view of the slowness of the passage and the difficulty of keeping them in marketable condition, the value has at no time during the past six years exceeded £3,563, while in 1877 it sank as low as £304. Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained. For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased.

For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa.

These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The General History of Africa textbook underscores the importance of these ports, highlighting Lagos as a key coastal town that evolved into a political capital and port due to European interest and the shift from the slave trade to legitimate trade. Bonny is noted for its involvement in the slave trade and later in the palm oil trade, a major export following the abolition of slavery. Old Calabar is recognized for the Efik's role as middlemen in the slave trade, further emphasizing its commercial significance. However, the textbook does not specifically mention Accra, which contrasts with the claim. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence of these ports' prominence, frequently mentioning them in trade reports and detailing the commodities traded, such as palm oil, palm kernels, and cotton, along with specific prices and quantities. These articles highlight the active commercial activities and the involvement of European merchants, particularly from Liverpool, underscoring the global connections of these ports. While the articles align with the claim regarding the ports' commercial significance, they do not explicitly address regional cooperation, focusing instead on trade dynamics and economic activities.

Both the Niger, the Cross river and other major rivers of the region were arteries of trade linking peoples along their courses, and receiving goods brought down to them from inland routes such as those passing from the Cross river valley to the Cameroon hinterland and south to the coast.\nEuropean traders along the coast, and gradually up the rivers, made use of the long-established centres of trade on the coast, and received goods brought down from the hinterland. Accordingly, the European presence on the coast became another unifying factor in the history of the region, presenting common problems and stimuli to change. Thus, each of the communities in the region underwent changes or adaptations in their social, political or cultural structures in the face of the external influences and challenge of European intrusion. The factors of European activity included: (i) the slave trade and the effects of its abolition in the nineteenth century; (2) the change to trade in local produce in place of slaves, sometimes referred to as legitimate trade; (3) the entry of Christian missionaries into the region, and (4) the onset of European imperialism and colonial conquest. These factors then, must be analysed in the study of each of the subregions in order to obtain a general idea of the history of the whole region in the nineteenth century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement.

That is, although Igboland provided most of the slaves sold at the ports of Bonny, and Elem Kalahari, in the Niger delta, and at Calabar on the Cross river estuary, the Igbo did not come into direct contact with the Europeans before the nineteenth century. Also, the Igbo country was not reached by visiting Europeans until the closing years of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century.

And for the rest of the century, the internal trade for slaves among the coastal peoples increased because of the demands of the palm-oil trade.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life. Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards.

Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850.

The Ovimbundu highlands were linked to the coast by another route that led to Caconda and Benguela.

The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts.

This network developed as a result of commercial and military expeditions sent into the Sudan and Därfür by the ruler of Egypt, Muhammad 'AIT. By about 1850, the Egyptians had reached the Bahr al-Ghazäl, where Egyptian, Coptic and European traders adopted the techniques perfected since the eighteenth century by the troops of the sultans of Darfur.

A European traveller, Georg Schweinfurth, accompanied some of these traders in the 1870s and left a valuable account of the Zande and Mangbetu kingdoms at the time when they first estab› lished regular contacts with Sudanese traders.\nThe Sudanese network had certain distinctive features, in particular the division of influence between state monopolies and private trade, the systematic use of force, mainly through the recruitment of local mercen› aries, and a policy of developing plantations for trade, particularly in cotton. These objectives and methods helped inspire the King of the Belgians, Leopold II, when he embarked on establishing a trading empire for himself in the Zaire basin.\nSince the 1860s, whole areas of the Central Africa region had also been incorporated in a trading network with bases in the ports and warehouses on the Swahili coast, in places such as Zanzibar and Bagamoyo, on the Indian Ocean. The Swahili routes which went into the region east of Lomami comprised two major groups of tracks. One was a 'corridor' passing through Unyanyembe in the central part of present-day Tanzania and crossing Lake Tanganyika from places such as Ujiji; the other led to the Luapula-Moero region either from Lake Malawi or from south-western Tanzania."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies', 'content': 'In examining the consequences of the expansion of long-distance trade to the interior we have avoided discussing two major regions. The first is the Great Lakes region which is the subject of Chapter 11. Perhaps it would suffice here to note that by the middle of the nineteenth century, there were many kingdoms of varying sizes in the area. Some of them were large and powerful while others were small and weak. But all of them had participated in a regional trade network whose routes connected most of the major capitals. It was into this regional trade network that the inter› national trade from the East African coast was to be absorbed. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the most powerful of these kingdoms were probably Buganda, Bunyoro and Burundi. But there were many others less powerful, including Busoga, Toro, the Ankole states (Nkore, Buhweju and Bunyaruguru),$^{28}$ Karagwe, the Buhaya states and Buzinza.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Peoples and states of the Great Lakes region', 'section_title': 'Trading circuits', 'content': 'The Bukerebe trading system - the southern sector of the eastern lake circuit - was sufficiently attractive to other trading groups to encourage Waswahili and Arab traders operating in the Unyamwezi area to draw up the filaments of Bukerebe carriage and exchange. Then, through encour› aging the production of slaves and ivory in the Bukerebe market area, these newcomers ultimately eclipsed the Bukerebe traders and their food-based exchange system in the south lake region. It was through this southern displacement that Waswahili and Arab traders and their merchandise first touched the Great Lakes region. The merchandise, first, then the traders after, plunged into the markets and states of the Lakes Plateau, moving along the same deeply cut routes west of Lake Victoria that were utilized by the salt lakes traders. Perhaps more important than the merchandise they introduced was the market for slaves and ivory they carried into the central part of the Lakes region. Firearms were exchanged for slaves and ivory. Eventually, Islamic and Christian teachers and European explorers, adventurers, and agents followed these same footpaths as the traders, creating new forces of change in the wider Lakes Plateau region.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 253, 'article_title': 'Tribute to the African-Aid Society', 'full_section_title': 'Tribute to the African-Aid Society', 'last_edit_date': '11-23-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_11_1863', 'content': 'I have forwarded a list of subscriptions to Accra and Elmina, and I hope by the next mail I will be able to forward you more.—I am, gentlemen, faithfully yours,\n\n**LAGOS.**'}, {'id': 2085, 'article_title': 'Liverpool Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Liverpool Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1871#article-10', 'issue_date': '23_09_1871', 'content': 'Palm-nut Kernels.—130 bags at 13l. 5s. to 13l. 7s. 6d. per ton.  \nPalm Oil.—The market is quieter, and the sales limited to 400 tons.

Still the commerce of these colonies is considerable, and quite worth looking after. The total trade of the four colonies in recent years averaged about £3,250,000. In 1884, the exports amounted to £2,000,000, and imports £1,700,000. Two millions of the total trade must be credited to the Gold Coast and Lagos, in which palm oil and palm kernels are of so much importance. The following table shows the value of the imports and exports for 1884:—\n\n|          | Imports. | Exports. |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Gambia   | £212,000 | £200,000 |\n| Sierra Leone | £464,000 | £377,000 |\n| Gold Coast | £527,000 | £467,000 |\n| Lagos    | £538,000 | £672,000 |\n| **Total** | **£1,741,000** | **£1,716,000** |\n\nFor the same year the total revenue of the four colonies was £281,942, and expenditure £269,382. Nearly the whole of the expenditure is for administration, leaving little for public works and the development of the resources of the settlements. The exports during the past ten years show considerable fluctuations in value, depending partly on the market value of the staple products, and partly on the more or less disturbed state of the interior, where the native tribes are constantly at war with each other. In 1875, the value of the exports on the Gold Coast was £327,012; in 1879, it was £751,850; in 1881, 1882, and 1883, it hovered round £350,000; suddenly advancing to £667,000 in 1884. For Lagos, the exports were valued at £517,535 in 1875, £734,707 in 1877, £460,000 in 1881, £594,000 in 1883, and £672,000 in 1884. For the last ten years the exports of Sierra Leone have kept pretty steadily at about £580,000; in 1876 they sank to £297,000, and in 1882 and 1883 rose to £420,000 and £442,000. Gambia shows considerably more variation; in 1875, the exports were valued at £147,465, sinking to £86,000 in 1876, and, with intermediate fluctuations, reaching £254,711 in 1882. Still the progress of the West African colonies during the past twenty-five years in all respects has been very marked, as will be seen from the following table:—\n\n|          | Population. | Revenue. | Tonnage. | Imports. | Exports. |\n|----------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| 1861...  | 289,900     | £69,000  | 230,850  | £517,620 | £550,860 |\n| 1884...  | 800,960     | £285,057 | 1,417,284| £1,741,000| £1,716,000|', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain. The protectorate, announced at Bonny, in December last, by Admiral Sir Walter Hunt Grubb, extends from the right bank of Benin river to the Rio del Rey, thus including Brass, New and Old Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, and other important trading stations.\n\nTwo series of considerations, the internal and external, have combined to render action imperative, and a retrospective view may not be uninstructive. Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo. He collected his scattered family, dependants, and slaves, and made his escape to the Opobo river. There Ja Ja found a place for his town, and established himself as King of Opobo.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1888#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent. For some months now the trade of Lagos has been blocked by the closing of the roads which, running through the district inhabited by the Jebu and Egba tribes, connect that port with the interior; but we are pleased to learn, from the latest telegrams received, that the careful and earnest steps that are being taken by the authorities to secure the opening of these trade routes, have not been without their moral effect upon the tribes implicated, for they are already making overtures of peace and reconciliation. It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit. The secret of good Colonial government would seem to consist in interfering as little as possible with Native customs and prejudices, but at the same time making it thoroughly understood that laws and ordinances must be respected. Now that the dispute with the Jebus and Egbas would seem to be in a fair way of settlement, it affords an opportunity to the Governor of Lagos to insure that, though these tribes are to be treated fairly and with patience, they must quite understand that any infraction of the engagements now or subsequently undertaken by them, will be visited most severely upon the offenders.\n\nBut the troubles in this part of the world are by no means confined to the British.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony.

The main features of this increase are the establishment of direct and regular steam communication, a fourfold increase in the shipping, an increase in imports of more than sixfold, while exports have doubled.\n\nIn the imports of Hamburg the West Coast of Africa now ranks fifth, and in exports fourth. First, as to shipping—in 1878, 25 vessels, of which 10 were German, with a total tonnage of 8,054 tons, arrived in Hamburg from the West Coast, and 98 vessels, of which 48 were German, of 25,674 tons left Hamburg, and none were steamers. In 1888 there were 63 vessels inwards, 34 being German, of a gross tonnage of 67,446 tons, and 89 outwards, 59 being German, of a gross tonnage of 72,885 tons. Of the inward vessels 54, and of the outward 59 were steamers. Thus in ten years the tonnage increased by about 400 per cent. Imports have increased far more than exports, because Hamburg has now become the centre of distribution for West African products.\n\nThe chief article of import is palm kernels, of which there were 973,405 cwts. in 1888, against 106,453 cwts. in 1878; in palm oil the quantities for the same years were 121,884 cwts. and 29,036 cwts., respectively; coffee, 11,109 cwts. and 96 cwts.; dyewood, 20,668 cwts. and 6,094 cwts.; india-rubber, 13,679 cwts. and 3,142 cwts.; and so on for less important articles. The total imports for 1888 amounted to 1,168,783 cwts., and the exports 1,121,605 cwts.; in 1878 the imports were 182,399 cwts., and the exports 495,660 cwts. The chief article of export is alcohol in one or other of its forms. The export of spirits in 1888 was 652,130 cwts., against 314,120 cwts. in 1878; the exports of the other principal articles for the two years were as follows: Rice, 90,778 cwts. in 1888 and 5,053 in 1878; beer, 16,479 and 2,919 cwts.; gunpowder, 86,320 and 10,844 cwts.; iron ware, 20,478 and 4,559 cwts.; tobacco, 12,048 and 2,784 cwts.; cotton goods, 11,053 and 3,110 cwts. In the non-European trade of Hamburg, West Africa comes sixth in imports, before Mexico, Singapore, Japan, China, &c., and next after British India.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Spirit Trade with West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A report has lately been drawn up by the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, and forwarded to the Secretary for the Colonies, in compliance with his request in August last for information on the subject and for suggestions to aid him in dealing with the matter, in view of statements made, to the effect that the promotion of trade in West Africa meant the promotion of trade in liquor.

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRADE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Captain J.

The General History of Africa provides a nuanced view of this transition, focusing on Africa's integration into the capitalist world-economy. It discusses the decline of the slave trade and the rise of export agriculture, particularly in regions like West Africa and the Niger delta, where palm oil and other natural products became significant exports. The textbook highlights the role of European, especially British, interests in promoting legitimate trade, framing it within broader economic and political changes rather than as a straightforward path to progress. It notes British involvement through naval power and treaties, suggesting that these efforts were more about maintaining British economic interests than purely advancing African progress. However, it does not specifically mention the Congo River in this context. In contrast, The African Times articles directly support the claim that the decline of the slave trade along the Congo River facilitated the rise of legitimate commerce, seen as essential for Africa's progress and attracting British merchants. The articles detail the diminishing slave trade on the Congo, the abandonment of slave factories, and the rise of legitimate trade, with British and other European merchants establishing factories and stations along the river. They highlight the shift from slave-based ivory transport to legitimate trade routes, such as the Congo Free State's ivory market at Stanley Falls, and the involvement of British companies like the British Congo Company. The articles also discuss the role of the African-Aid Society and British naval efforts in promoting legitimate commerce and suppressing the slave trade, while acknowledging challenges like domestic slavery and infrastructure needs. Together, these sources illustrate the transition from slave trade to legitimate commerce, with differing emphases on geographic focus and the portrayal of British involvement.","The General History of Africa textbook provides a nuanced view of the transition from the slave trade to legitimate commerce, particularly in the context of Africa's integration into the capitalist world-economy.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""The naval squadrons were less concerned about suppression than about their task of protecting the 'legitimate' trade of their own nationals.

In 1838, Bouºt-Willaumez, later Governor of Senegal and the forerunner of colonization, ordered a systematic survey to be carried out of the possibilities for trade between Senegal and Gabon. Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.738, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

But, in the nineteenth century, the accumulation of captives by certain privileged groups often coincided with the rapid growth ofa marketrelated sector of the economy rather than with economic expansion due to increased payments of tribute-money.

Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered. The river, the Lomami by name, was found easily navigable and with a good depth. The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town. The communication between Niangwe and Stanley Falls by the Congo is almost impossible, owing to the many falls and rapids; and the Lomami will form a further means of extending protection and bringing civilisation to regions which have suffered much from the Arab raids for slaves."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS COMMISSIONERSHIP', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo.

Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN ""MIDDLEMAN"" AND OTHER HINDRANCES TO TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The populations seen in the towns on the river banks must not be taken as a proof that the parts not visited are equally populous; and we must remember that the negro, when first he becomes acquainted with the fabrics of the looms of Europe, does immediately array himself in fathom upon fathom of calico. We must also take into consideration that the merchants of other nations are seeking for new markets with as much avidity as we are, and that the manufacturers of Mulhausen and other foreign towns will meet the products of our looms on a footing of equality. Another question which has to be overcome in the Upper Congo is the difficulty and cost of transport between Vivi and Stanley Pool. The American officers sent to report on the advantages to the trade of the United States to be expected from the opening up of the Congo, say that on this section there was famine and disease, and that even the employés of the International Association were suffering from these causes, and that transport was both scarce and costly.\n\nUntil some better route is opened up, the trade of the Upper Congo can only be tentatively opened, as it is doubtful if ivory even will be able to stand the great cost of carriage. The trade on the Lower Congo is rapidly increasing in value and importance; but some disastrous ventures have been made, and investors have been deterred from joining in enterprises for its development on account of some businesses which have not realized the prospects held out by their promoters. The Dutch are the largest traders in the Lower Congo, and the slave trade continued longer there than in any other place on the West Coast; and even after it was put a stop to, many of those who had been engaged in it remained, and brought into more legitimate trade the lawless habits they had acquired in their previous avocation; and the native inhabitants of the creeks and shores of the stream were lawless and fierce, and not unfrequently indulged in piracy. The expedition under Sir William Hewett, in 1875, put a great check on their practices, and since then both English and Portuguese men-of-war have chastised breaches of law and order, but some of the worst offenders amongst the Europeans managed to escape the punishment they merited.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1885#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Outlook in the Congo Basin', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In view of increased interest in the Congo question, the vigorous resistance to any interference with the freedom of trade in those regions, and the feeling that the condition of trade makes the opening of new markets for the staple manufactures of this district a necessity, the Congo basin affords a suitable region for attempts to carry into effect the idea suggested at the annual meeting of the Manchester Guardian Trade Protection Society. One of the speakers suggested that as trade appears to be suffering from the fact that production exceeds consumption, it would be a good thing if capital was more systematically devoted to the work of distribution. We must conclude that some impulse to the distribution of wealth is needed; and a wider distribution of mercantile profits would doubtless be a consequence of the application of the joint-stock principle to mercantile enterprise.\n\nThere is a well-founded belief that the economic development of Africa will be a work of time, and that it is not at all likely to advance by ""leaps and bounds."" The fact is, that so far as the West Coast is concerned, experienced authorities have pointed out that the black man must be interested in cultivation if trade is to be permanent and African communities are to become large consumers of European manufactures. At the present rate of indiscriminate collection, the supplies of ivory must eventually be exhausted, the India-rubber and other plants be destroyed, and the whole country be converted into a waste. It is upon the interior that the interest of the trading and investing public is concentrated, because it is the region of untried possibilities. But the prudent ask whether, assuming the existence of vast stores of produce and favourable conditions of development and progress, markets can be found at paying prices for the produce which Central Africa may yield. It is a question of cost as well as of productiveness. African rivers are interrupted by cataracts from which the great rivers of other continents still only partially developed are free. It is true that the construction of railways is hinted at, but questions arise as to what will be the cost of such railways, who will provide the capital, how long before they become remunerative, and how many transhipments will be required; for it is conceivable that the mere cost of transporting produce to the consuming markets might prove greater than the price obtainable for them.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Exploration in Central Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""My Lord,—Since I last wrote from here I have made a successful voyage round the southern part of the Tanganyika, and have discovered its outlet in a river named the Lukuga, a little to the south of the group of islands visited by Captain Speke in 1859. I think, also, from what I have heard from the Arabs here, that the Lualabas is the Congo. My reasons for saying this are fully stated in the letter and journal I am now sending to the Royal Geographical Society, who will no doubt afford every information on the subject. One important fact (if true) mentioned by my Arab informant requires looking into. He said he met no English merchants, although he heard of them and of our men-of-war, as all the white merchants he met traded in slaves. This, if true, would point to the Spanish and Portuguese merchants on the Congo. Of the vast importance to the trading community of England of the Congo and Lualaba proving one, there is little for me to say, but I will glance over the principal articles of export. The Guinea palm extends, I believe, from the West Coast to here; india-rubber is abundant in Manyema; sem sem (from which much so-called olive oil is extracted) grows well wherever cultivated; the castor-oil plant grows almost wild; ground nuts the same; copper and gold are found in Katanga; cotton grows well, and of two or three kinds; coffee is reported to grow wild; ivory, it is well known, mostly comes from this portion of Africa; there are many sorts of fibrous substances which might be exported with advantage, and the various millets and maize grow in such abundance that they would form a profitable export; rice also grows most luxuriantly wherever cultivated. The only obstacles to a free water communication of which I know are the Yellala Falls and the rapids on the Lualaba, a short way above the Nyangwé; the Lukuga is at present obstructed with grass, but a way might easily be cut through that. The trade at present is, about here, entirely in the hands of Arabs, who, when in Manyema, live nearly entirely by plunder, and who take the wretched inhabitants as slaves to carry their ivory and other goods. The efforts of England will, I trust, be successful in putting down the slave trade by sea, but at present they leave untouched an equally crying evil, the internal trade, which is rapidly depopulating vast districts. In going round the lake I was constantly shown places where villages had been, and when I asked where the former inhabitants were, invariably received the same answer, \'Killed or carried off for slaves.\' The price of a slave is only 5 dolis (20 yards) of calico, while the hire of a passage is 5l from Unyanyembe here; so that it is far cheaper to buy slaves than to hire porters; besides which, no porters are obtainable in Manyema, and the whole trade there is carried on by means of slaves. The Arabs take with them a horde of Wangwana, or freed men, armed with muskets, and carry a few stores by means of domestic slaves; and the ivory, of which they obtain large quantities, is all brought by fresh-caught slaves to Ujiji. The numbers of Arabs settling in the country is constantly increasing, and they all have large numbers of slaves for domestic purposes, for cultivating their gardens, and for porters. Many of those employed as porters only receive rations whilst on journeys, and when not travelling have to live by plunder. Of the relations between the various tribes there is little to be said; the agricultural people seldom make war on each other, unless they get mixed up with the quarrels of the Arabs, to any great extent; the predatory tribes prey on all others indiscriminately, carrying off slaves, and murdering all who attempt to resist.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE LATEST DECREES OF THE CONGO FREE STATE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'By that Royal Decree, the export duties from the Congo Free State were increased—For ivory, from 50 to 200 frs. per 100 kilogs.; for rubber, from 20 to 50 frs. per 100 kilogs.; whilst by the next Decree the freedom from export duties on produce from the Upper Congo is withdrawn.\n\nWe venture to observe that the levying of a duty solely based on the weight of articles of produce, subject to differences in value through market fluctuations, &c., will be universally condemned.\n\nIf this be of less moment when a small duty is concerned, it is indefensible in the case of duties which may be styled extortionate.\n\nRather than indulging in arguments, we will come forward with figures provable by our books—During 1888 and 1889 we exported 791,064 kilogs. rubber (thimbles), which produced 1,466,649,71 f.; at the exchange of 100 Dutch guilders to 208 frs., 3,050,631,39 frs.; making per 100 kilogs. 385,63 frs.\n\nNow if an export duty of 50 frs. per 100 kilogs. be levied, then this is about 13 per cent. on the price free on board, leaving no margin for interest or profit.\n\nOf ivory, we exported during the same years 128,225 kilogs., which produced 1,406,714,10 f.; being in francs, 2,925,965,32 frs.; per kilogram, 22,82 frs.\n\nCalculating on the above—License duty at 2 frs.; export duty at 2 frs.; total, 4 frs., or about 17½ per cent.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

But by the mid-nineteenth century, Bell Town and Bimbia traders, working together, had begun to compete successfully though peacefully with the leading traders of the Rio del Rey.\nThe slaves who arrived at the coast in the 1840s, mostly captives from the Bali-Chamba raids in the Bamenda grasslands, represented a critical element in the transition of coastal societies from slave-trading to legitimate commerce. In the Cameroon river and Bimbia, as in Calabar and the Niger delta, slaves were used in producing palm oil and palm kernels and other commodities of legitimate commerce. At Bimbia and the Cameroon river, an important variation was the well-organized system by which Kings William and Bell hired out some of their slaves to the West African Company at Fernando Po. The system assumed the nature of indenture, and provided an additional source of wealth for both monarchs. But the system was open to abuses, and led to British parliamentary investigation. King William was moved to protest not only against the company's failure to pay his men but also their maltreatment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': ""Moreover, in West Africa as to some extent in the Portuguese areas of Mozambique and Angola, while some members of the educated elite entered the professions as civil servants, teachers, catechists, ministers and church agents - by 1885 according to the latest account, the Wesleyans had 15 African ministers, 43 catechists, 259 preachers and 79 teachers in the Gold Coast32 - the majority entered the commercial field as independent traders and operated on credit provided by the foreign companies and resident traders. It was the latter, described as the 'aspirant bourgeoisie' by Susan Kaplow,33 who, as will be seen later, pushed the frontiers of retail trade in the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Nigeria further and further inland during the period under review. As one report from the Gold Coast put it, by 1850, the young men had gone to reside in the interior as traders and clerks and it was they who were 'causing a great increase in the consumption of the manufactures ofGreat Britain and are widely extending commerce and civilisation amongst the native population'.34 Similar social developments took place in Madagascar and in Central and East Africa. Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The Portuguese made extensive claims both in Angola and in Mozambique. They had established military outposts and prazos (agricultural estates) in the interior, and from time to time they controlled the area from Loje, south of Cuanza, as far east as Kassanje, apart from trading posts on the coast between Ambriz and Moçâmedes. In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials. The increased demand for slaves in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century had shifted attention from the prazo system, and the security of the trade routes depended more on the pombeiros (barefoot mulatto merchants), bearing Brazilian trade-goods and surviving only on the good will of African rulers and merchants.$^{10}$ The French had revived their trading posts in Senegambia after 1815, notably Saint-Louis and GorØe. Their venture to establish an agricultural farm in Waalo with a military post in Bakel to protect it had been a failure. In North Africa, they seized Algiers in 1830. They spent the next twenty years overcoming the resistance of the Algerians, notably the movement led by Amir 'Abd al-Kädir. The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture. With the increasing prosperity and expansion of the Creoles to Bathurst (now Banjul), Badagry, Lagos and beyond, British commercial and missionary influence was spreading along the coast and at one or two points like Abeokuta began to penetrate into the interior around 1850. On the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the British still shared the trade with the Danes and the Dutch, and took measures to resist Asante (Ashanti) efforts to dominate the coast, notably by exploiting the Fante fear of Asante domination and encouraging the Fante to act together under British tutelage.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life. Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': ""It was neither a deliberate policy on the part of British colonial rulers which saved the land in British West Africa for the Africans during the inter-war period, nor was it because of the notorious reputation that West Africa had acquired as 'the White Man's Grave' by the late nineteenth century.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Delayed incorporation of eastern Africa', 'content': 'The eastern coast of Africa was also still relatively outside the capitalist world-economy.

Nonetheless, it served there, as it had in west-central Africa, as a dynamic disruptive and recon› structing force.

The list of names for a trading—a Barter Company, is perfectly astounding. One feels as if wandering in the Jewel Garden of the ""Arabian Nights."" An Honourable, a Knight, a Queen\'s Counsel, a late Governor (Acting Governor, it should have been), a late Civil Commandant and Major, a Lieutenant-Colonel, a late Colonial Secretary and Lieutenant-Governor, and, finally, a Liberian Honourable, quite take away one\'s breath. We feel at once overpowered by the importance of such a Company, and wonder they did not ask for 400,000l. instead of 40,000l. There may, however, be too many plums in a pudding—even in a trading one; and in reading this magniloquent prospectus, one cannot fail recalling to mind the Irishman\'s apple-pie, made all of quinces. But no; this, if an apple-pie, is not all quinces; the apple is there, though it has modestly smothered itself in quinces; and our first wonder as to who was really to conduct the trading operations of this Company, was removed when we came to the quiet yet all-important announcement that the Company has entered into a contract of January, 1871, with Mr. David Chinnery. We do not know what this contract is, and think it ought to have been set forth; it may be one possibly worth 50 per cent. per annum to the shareholders past, present, or to come; but we surmise that the very essence of the management of the Company will be found in this contract; or, in other words, that Mr. David Chinnery, who has certainly had long experience in African trading, is, somehow or other, the real head and soul of the Company; and if so, we think it would have been better to have stated it openly and boldly—to have really exhibited this great apple among the quinces, and not to have allowed it to appear as if the trading operations depended upon the dignified persons whose titles we have already glanced at. We think, too, that the other contracts with Messrs Edward Parry, William Lowell, and Alexander Christie ought to have been set forth when the public is appealed to for subscriptions.'}, {'id': 3040, 'article_title': 'Important Reduction in Steam Freight on Palm-Nut Kernels', 'full_section_title': 'Important Reduction in Steam Freight on Palm-Nut Kernels', 'last_edit_date': '01-01-1876', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1876#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_02_1876', 'content': '[We have received the following communication.—Ed.

In July, the Mignonette, a cutter of only 33 tons, and manned by a crew of five, left Southampton for Sydney. After about ten days at sea, they experienced very severe weather, and the crew were reduced to such extremity that they killed and ate one of their number. For this, on their arrival at Falmouth, the survivors were put on their trial, and the result is awaited with painful interest.\n\nLords Wolseley and Northbrook arrived at Cairo on the 9th, and immediately set to work in their respective missions. A few days after news reached London of a great victory gained by General Gordon over the rebel forces. Altogether the prospects of the Soudan appear greatly improved.\n\nThe Cholera outbreak appears almost to have subsided in France; but at Naples the epidemic has been most severe, heightened by the action of the inhabitants, who seem to have conceived the idea that the doctors poisoned their patients. King Humbert has acted most nobly in visiting the stricken, and his example has had a wonderful effect in calming the populace.\n\nThere has been an alarming outbreak of typhoid fever at Kidderminster, owing to the bad condition of the drinking water. Nearly 800 people, mostly children, have been attacked, and the deaths have been about seventy.\n\n---\n\nOn the 18th Mr. Stanley delivered an address on the Congo to the members of the London Chamber of Commerce.

Meanwhile, much interest attaches to the opening of Parliament for its autumn session, which is to take place on the 24th October.\n\nIn Belgium there have been grave troubles over the action of the newly-elected Ministry, who seek to undo the work of their predecessors in the matter of secular education.\n\nThe Social Science Congress has been holding its annual gathering at Birmingham, and its proceedings have been perused with great interest.\n\nA very sad shipwreck has occurred off the west coast of Ireland, H.M.S.

It is a circumstance for wonder on the part of merchants in Liverpool that the British Government and nation have not been more alive to the real importance of British interests on the West African coasts. The principal theme of discussion is necessarily the action of Germany in respect of the Congo. The action of Prince Bismarck in convening a Conference on the subject is said to be a step which was the least expected of any, being such a signal departure from the policy hitherto pursued by the Chancellor. Although the German Chancellor was the first to openly show his hostility to the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty, it was conjectured by the Liverpool merchants that Germany being involved to a very small degree, the invitation to a Conference would have been left to a Power more largely affected. The Liverpool merchants, however, express themselves satisfied with the action of Germany, as if the projected Conference meets, it will doubtless place matters on a definite footing. The uncertainty which at present surrounds the question of who will be the future ruler of the Congo prevents any fresh enterprise being embarked on the river, and is even doing very much to destroy the trade already conducted in that district. This is nowhere more marked than in the steam communication between England and South-west Africa, the departures to which are now just half what they were some time ago. The merchants of Liverpool, trading with West Africa, profess to have reason to fear a revival of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty if Portugal can obtain the consent of the other foreign Powers. They say that notwithstanding the declaration of Lord E. Fitzmaurice in the House of Commons a few months back, when the instrument was withdrawn, they believe that our own Government is willing to bring forward the treaty again if the consent of the other Powers is obtained by Portugal. To obviate this recurrence, the merchants welcome a Conference, although not convened by England. With regard to the German action on the West Coast, it seems that protests have been sent to Earl Granville from several public bodies in Liverpool respecting the annexation of the Cameroons; and the merchants claim that in this place English political sovereignty has been established for years past. It is said that the English interest in the Cameroons river is of the annual value of more than £150,000. The idea of ruling the Niger along with the Congo, on the Danubian principle of the Vienna Treaty, finds no favour with Liverpool merchants. Not only was the Niger discovered and opened up to trade by Englishmen, but the protectorate of England has been continuous and admitted on all hands. Then, again, Englishmen enjoy no exclusive privilege in the river, which, like all possessions in England, is free to all comers. The idea of German colonization, particularly in West Africa, is ridiculed as absurd in many quarters, for, apart from the extremely unhealthy nature of the climate, Germans residing in such German colonies would be liable at any moment to be subject to the military system of the Fatherland. This is not the case in English possessions, or in England itself, and the great number of German merchants in British West African possessions, and notably Lagos, is pointed out as a strong indication of the preference of English rule. If any places now under the protection of any established government should be dealt with by the Conference, surely it should be the Portuguese possessions in South-west Africa from Loanda to Benguela, and the French settlements, in which exclusive privileges are allowed to Portuguese and French subjects, and other traders are handicapped by having to pay a duty positively prohibitory.'}, {'id': 5107, 'article_title': 'Domestic Occurrences', 'full_section_title': 'Domestic Occurrences', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-19', 'issue_date': '01_05_1885', 'content': 'Just Published, and sent post free on receipt of One Shilling.\nBy J.

On leaving they were accompanied to Holyhead by a deputation of the Citizens' Reception Committee. Among those who were invited by the Lord Mayor, M.P., and Lady Mayoress, were the names of our native West African friends, Mr. J. A.

He also had the honour of replying at the conversazione at the Town Hall, Manchester, and in the course of his remarks mentioned the name of the late Thomas Clegg, Esq., as being one of the pioneers in promoting the trade of raw cotton from the interior of Lagos to Manchester. At the luncheon at Mr. Laird's place in Birkenhead, Mr. Payne introduced the name of the late Macgregor Laird, Esq., as the pioneer of the opening of the Niger trade; and at the banquet in Liverpool he expressed a hope that Lagos in her commercial relations with England will soon become the Liverpool of West Africa; and as she sends Liverpool good cotton, Liverpool must send her good cloths in return. He also addressed a large audience at Chester, and about 5,000 school children at Dover, and the conversazione at the Town Hall, Sheffield, and at the establishment of Messrs. Wm.

Still, the dread of the knife is so keen, even among the bravest men, that its use is on all occasions regarded with something of distrust. Progress in medicine is, happily, yearly reducing the necessity of this extreme operation, and people are not without hope that it may soon be almost entirely abolished. In a number of cases in which amputation would have been necessary, the use of the knife appears to have been recently avoided merely by the use of a purely vegetable ointment. This composition, distinguished as the ""Lion,"" and prepared by **Mr. E. BURGESS, of High Holborn,** has won golden opinions from all sorts and conditions of men as a remedy for most skin diseases, old and poisoned wounds, cancers, tumours, ulcers, and other affections. Introduced to the public quietly, and without flourish of trumpets or bold advertisement, it has won wide popular favour, judging from a long list of testimonials now before me, by sheer force of its wonderful curative virtues. Instances innumerable are forthcoming of the almost magical disappearance of diseases of the character I have indicated upon the application of this ointment, and in cases, too, where the treatment of celebrated specialists had entirely failed. To residents in the up-country districts of the colonies, where, under any circumstances, medical aid can only be secured with difficulty, the possession of such an ointment is of the highest value and importance, while the fact that it is a well-approved remedy for stings and venomous bites must strongly commend it to such of my readers as dwell in India and the tropics.""\n\nOf all Chemists, or through any Wholesale House in England.  \n**AGENT: T.

Lord Aberdare, G.C.B., the Governor of the Company.\n\nThe Secretary (Mr. Henry Morley) read the notice convening the meeting.\n\nThe Chairman regretted to announce the absence of Lord Aberdare, who had sent a telegram saying that he was unwell and unable to attend the meeting, therefore they would be obliged to proceed without him.\n\nThe Report and Balance-sheet were taken as read. The former stated that notwithstanding the continued depression of prices in the principal articles of West African produce, the net profits for the year 1888—after writing off £19,094 for depreciation on steamers, stations, plant, &c., and placing £5,000 to the Insurance Fund—amount to £33,172 1s. 6d. Of this sum, £4,628 15s. 5d. has been absorbed by the deficit from 1887, and £22,167 10s. has been already distributed among the shareholders in two interim dividends of 2½ per cent. each. The first of these interim dividends (£11,083 15s.) was paid during 1888, and consequently appears in the balance-sheet. The second dividend amounting to £11,083 15s. was not paid till January 1889, and must therefore be deducted from the final balance shown of £17,459 11s. 1d. leaving still available the sum of £6,375 16s. 1d. Out of this sum the Council recommend the distribution of a further dividend, payable (free of income tax) on the 15th August, of 1 per cent., amounting to £4,433 10s., making a total dividend of 6 per cent. for the 1888, and leaving an undistributed balance of £1,942 6s. 1d. to be carried forward.\n\nThe Chairman said that fortunately Lord Aberdare had prepared his speech, and all he (the speaker) had to do was to read it to them, and they would understand that when in that address he used the word ""I,"" it would refer to Lord Aberdare and not himself.

Our troubles with that School have always been very great, as, owing to the amount of gas consumed and the necessity of keeping the School well heated on account of the nude models, its tendency has been to get unbearably hot; and when windows were attempted to be opened the draughts were most dangerous.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.'}, {'id': 6174, 'article_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': '12-01-1891', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_12_1891', 'content': '**JAMES FLYNN & SONS,**  \n4-8 PHILLIPS ST., & 15-19 PUMPFIELDS,  \nVAUXHALL ROAD, LIVERPOOL,  \n*Coopers, Cask, and General Merchants, and Commission Agents.*\n\n**ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF BUTTS, PUNCHEONS, HHDS.,** SUITABLE FOR THE COAST TRADE.  \n**CHEMICAL AND OIL COOPERS.**  \n*Payment accepted in Products.*\n\n**TO RESIDENTS IN AFRICA & THE COLONIES.**\n\n**HARRIS & SON,**  \n**MONUMENTAL MASONS,**  \nBEAUMONT STREET,  \nMILE END,  \nLONDON,  \nENGLAND.  \nMonuments, Tombs, & Headstones in Stone, Marble, or Granite, with Letters in Imperishable Lead.  \n*SPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR AFRICA AND THE COLONIES.*  \nCHURCH TABLETS & STATUARY.\n\nOrders should be sent direct to Messrs.

And further, as regards expenditure in connexion with the exploration and occupation of territories beyond the concession area, that the Company should receive an additional sum, which should represent an aggregate refund of 10s. 6d. in the pound to the total capital expended, with present effect, or if delay should be unavoidable, without charge to the Company on account of subsequent expenditure.""\n\nThe directors hoped to have the Foreign Secretary\'s reply in time for the meeting of shareholders.'}, {'id': 6764, 'article_title': 'Elephants and the Ivory Trade', 'full_section_title': 'Elephants and the Ivory Trade', 'last_edit_date': '10-01-1896', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_10_1896', 'content': 'DR.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.747, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trading operations of Europeans in West Africa are carried on after the following manner: The trader selects a site suitable—generally by the side of a river or creek, or along the seashore—and comes to terms with the owner of the soil or the native chief of the district for the leasing of the land, the natives retaining a dislike to alienating any part of their country. All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home. With every trading colony of any size—that is to say, where there are more than three or four trading houses—there is a medical officer, jointly paid by the various firms.\n\nPerhaps in no body of Englishmen abroad has such an improvement taken place as in the class of men who now conduct the trade with the natives in West Africa. In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa. Yearly the improvement continues; more and more the great trading companies of Liverpool and Bristol have realised that their interests are better served by men of good manners and refinement.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Mr. H. H. Johnston's address on British West Africa and the Trade of the Interior merits thoughtful attention. He starts with the proposition that Englishmen generally have not sufficient thought of the importance of our possessions on the West Coast; and still less of their possibilities. But he reminded his hearers that British West Africa is not a field for Anglo-Saxon colonisation. While there are tracts in the interior, where Europeans could lead happy and healthy lives, the west in general is a land of negroes. The mass of the population must always be of the negro race. Through the use of proper means Mr. Johnston is convinced the native race can be civilised and rendered industrious to a very satisfactory extent. Mr. Johnston's theory is that England should enlarge its borders to the utmost. British trade is the lever he proposes for the enlightenment of the black race. The more the territory which is acquired the more can that influence be exerted. With British trade the appliances of European civilisation are bound to advance.\n\nThey will fast educate the negro both morally and intellectually.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

Every year the missionary schools discharge a number of educated men and women who almost invariably embark in trade. Most of them have some small capital, which they use to trade with the interior natives, and the produce they thus obtain they either ship on consignment to England, to obtain the proceeds in British and other goods and silver coin, or sell it to the large British and foreign mercantile houses on the Coast, receiving goods from them in exchange for a renewal of operations with the producers in the interior. These native traders almost universally prefer to remit their produce to Europe for sale; but in this they labour under the great disadvantage of having their capital locked up until they obtain from Europe the proceeds of the sales, in goods or money. They estimate their loss through such delays at something like 25 per cent., and there can be no doubt that the facilities a bank might safely afford would be productive of great gain, both to the traders and the bank; while, if the limits of our article would permit, we could point out how the European mercantile establishments may also be largely benefited thereby. To every one acquainted with the business of the West Coast, and the mode in which it is conducted, it is patent that the establishment of a well-conducted bank, with adequate capital, will lead to a greatly increased production on the West Coast—in a few years, it may be, to 100 per cent. increase. A bank, moreover, that is capable of offering ample guarantees for the safety of moneys deposited with it, cannot fail of being highly useful to the public service as bankers to the several Administrations, receiving from the Colonial Treasurers the proceeds of the Customs' duties and other sources of revenue, and holding them at the disposal of the Government in the shape most convenient to the latter. Such a bank will link West Africa, now isolated, with the great financial system of the civilized world, giving her a recognized position therein—a fact of enormous importance for the British West African Settlements, when we consider that almost everything that can be accomplished by capital has yet to be effected there. All the aids and appliances of civilization for facilitating communications between the Coast and the interior, for economizing labour, for the transport of goods and produce, and for the development of the abounding natural and mineral resources, have yet to be introduced; and a well-established bank, giving large dividends to its shareholders, will show European capital the way to further profitable investment in those too long neglected countries. We have always steadfastly maintained that ere many years the West Africa Settlements will take rank among the most valuable colonial possessions of Great Britain, and every fresh step towards the realization of this prediction is to us a source of real delight. The bank is such a step, and we shall welcome it with all our heart. We can assure it, too, a welcome all along the West Coast, to which it cannot fail to prove a benefactor. Our only regret at this moment is, that it will not be brought before the public in time for us to advertise it more fully in this number of our journal.

Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.743, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'West Africa is one of the richest mineral regions on the planet, and England has been given an entrance to it for the purpose of spreading a civilisation and Christianity that will not do harm to the cause of the Gospel or bring disgrace on morality.

The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers.

This illusion is being rapidly dispelled by disinterested travellers. The Englishman, through unhealthy habits, may dig his own grave even in England, as so many thousands do annually. Besides, were London as innocent of sanitary arrangements as Freetown, it would soon become the white man\'s grave in grim reality.

In 1884, the exports amounted to £2,000,000, and imports £1,700,000. Two millions of the total trade must be credited to the Gold Coast and Lagos, in which palm oil and palm kernels are of so much importance.

Nearly the whole of the expenditure is for administration, leaving little for public works and the development of the resources of the settlements. The exports during the past ten years show considerable fluctuations in value, depending partly on the market value of the staple products, and partly on the more or less disturbed state of the interior, where the native tribes are constantly at war with each other. In 1875, the value of the exports on the Gold Coast was £327,012; in 1879, it was £751,850; in 1881, 1882, and 1883, it hovered round £350,000; suddenly advancing to £667,000 in 1884. For Lagos, the exports were valued at £517,535 in 1875, £734,707 in 1877, £460,000 in 1881, £594,000 in 1883, and £672,000 in 1884. For the last ten years the exports of Sierra Leone have kept pretty steadily at about £580,000; in 1876 they sank to £297,000, and in 1882 and 1883 rose to £420,000 and £442,000. Gambia shows considerably more variation; in 1875, the exports were valued at £147,465, sinking to £86,000 in 1876, and, with intermediate fluctuations, reaching £254,711 in 1882.

It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary. Our trade with Sierra Leone is mainly dependent upon the caravan traffic between the British port of Freetown and the upper portion of the Niger.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.729, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone is not a colony about which we can boast very much. It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power. Such trade as is done with it is purely British, and is chiefly with the town of Bristol.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.729, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With the present class of trader little fault can be found.

978,"The trade of European luxury goods in Africa, including items like champagne and perfumes, indicates an emerging consumer culture and stratified society with varying wealth levels, influenced by European tastes and adapted to local conditions.","The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the trade of European luxury goods in Africa and its implications for consumer culture and societal stratification. The ""General History of Africa"" highlights the economic and social transformations in Africa, focusing on essential goods like palm oil, groundnuts, and textiles, and the spread of European tastes, such as drinking heavily sugared tea. It discusses the emergence of a stratified society with varying wealth levels, influenced by income redistribution through export agriculture, but does not specifically mention luxury goods like champagne and perfumes. This absence suggests that such items may not have been as prominent in the historical context covered by the textbook. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence supporting the claim, detailing the trade of luxury items such as champagne, brandy, gin, and Rimmel's perfumes, which were noted for their suitability for the African market. This indicates a demand for European luxury goods and suggests a stratified society with varying wealth levels. The articles also describe the adaptation of local populations to European styles, particularly in the German Protectorates of Namaqualand and Damaraland, and the role of European merchants in introducing these goods, supporting the notion of an emerging consumer culture influenced by European tastes. However, the articles do not explicitly address societal stratification or wealth levels, which is a notable difference from the claim. Together, these sources illustrate the complex interplay between European influences and local adaptations in shaping African consumer culture.","The ""General History of Africa"" textbook provides several insights into the economic and social transformations in Africa during the period under review, but it does not specifically mention the trade of European luxury goods like champagne and perfumes. The text highlights the introduction of European products, such as textiles, and the spread of European tastes, such as the custom of drinking heavily sugared tea, indicating some influence of European consumer culture. However, the focus is primarily on essential goods and commodities like palm oil, groundnuts, and textiles, which were more significant in the trade dynamics and economic transformations. The text also discusses the emergence of a stratified society with varying wealth levels, influenced by the redistribution of income from the ruling elite to ordinary people through export agriculture. While these points suggest an adaptation to European influences and a stratified society, the specific claim about luxury goods like champagne and perfumes is not directly supported by the textbook. This absence of mention is a notable difference, as it suggests that the trade of such luxury items may not have been as prominent or impactful in the historical context covered by the textbook.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the trade of European luxury goods in Africa and the emergence of a consumer culture influenced by European tastes. The articles mention the sale of luxury items such as champagne, brandy, gin, and perfumes, specifically Rimmel's perfumery, which is noted for its suitability for the African trade due to its quality. This suggests a demand for European luxury goods, indicating a stratified society with varying wealth levels. Additionally, the presence of European clothing and the adaptation of local populations to European styles, as seen in the German Protectorates of Namaqualand and Damaraland, further supports the claim of European influence on local consumer culture. The articles also highlight the role of European merchants and trading companies in introducing these goods, which aligns with the idea of an emerging consumer culture shaped by European tastes. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the societal stratification or the varying wealth levels, which is an interesting difference from the claim. Overall, the articles provide evidence of European luxury goods being traded in Africa and influencing local consumer habits, supporting the notion of an emerging consumer culture.",True,978,Economic Impact and Trade Dynamics,Global Economic Integration of African economies,"[{'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': ""Moreover, in West Africa as to some extent in the Portuguese areas of Mozambique and Angola, while some members of the educated elite entered the professions as civil servants, teachers, catechists, ministers and church agents - by 1885 according to the latest account, the Wesleyans had 15 African ministers, 43 catechists, 259 preachers and 79 teachers in the Gold Coast32 - the majority entered the commercial field as independent traders and operated on credit provided by the foreign companies and resident traders.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sahara in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Desert trade and the nomads', 'content': 'Changes in European military technology accelerated in the latter half of the nineteenth century, with the result that European forces, armed with the latest weapons, faced opponents with outdated arms.

Trade with Europe had existed before, but the nineteenth century witnessed a massive increase in the scale of this trade with varying effects depending on the structure of Saharan regional economies.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'On the eve of the nineteenth century', 'content': 'This pattern of local and inter-regional commerce, buttressed by a limited mining and manufacturing sector, helped to shape and sustain trade between the interior and the coast. Although the data are fragmentary, it is clear that throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries an international network built upon localized trading provided commodities for the Indian Ocean ports dominated by Indian and Muslim merchant capital. Among the most important were ivory from the Luangwa valley and adjacent Undi territory, gold from the mines in the kingdoms of Manica and Changamire and just north of Tete, and copper from the Kafue region.$^{15}$ The scale of this trade seems to have been relatively small and somewhat irregular until the last two decades of the eighteenth century. The eastward thrust of the Lunda of Kazembe and their commercial alliance with the Bisa, the intensified activities of Yao merchants from the coast, and the commercial expansion of the Chikunda traders from the Zambezi prazos dramatically increased the level of exports to the Indian Ocean entrepôts. All three groups acquired substantial quantities of ivory and slaves for the world market, setting the stage for the progressive incorporation into the larger world economy, which was based almost entirely on the exchange of these two commodities for European manu› factured goods. 16 Transformation in the political and economic systems often generated parallel changes in the social and ethnic composition of Central African societies. The immigration of alien Shona- and Lunda-related peoples resulted in widespread intermarriage and even the emergence of entirely new ethnic groups, such as the Sena, Zambezi Tonga, and Goba.$^{17}$ The immigrants generally succeeded in imposing their core institutions and values upon the local population. The spread of the Lunda social mech› anism of perpetual kinship and positional succession throughout much of the region north of the Zambezi, for example, altered the basic structure of kinship and carried profound implications for the transmission of king› ship.$^{18}$ Of similar significance was the spread of the Shona Mwari cult and the supporting system of national ancestor spirits (mhondoró) throughout the southern tier of the Zambezi. The simultaneous introduction of the Shona language and symbol system in conjunction with the spread of Mwari must have fundamentally altered the cosmology of the indigenous inhabitants.$^{19}$ Culture change, however, was not unidirectional.

The Sudanese and Muslim character of these societies made them more stable than those of the Gulf of Guinea, but they were nevertheless deeply affected by changes in the external demand for their products and people. The slave trade from this region had been declining since the 1760s, with a brief increase in the 1780s. Neither the legal abolition of the British slave trade in 1808 nor the effective en› forcement of the French anti-slave-trade legislation in 1831 niade much difference to a trade that was already declining but nevertheless continued in a small way in various disguised or illegal forms until the 1850s. The more important economic change was the enormous increases in the prices offered for Senegambian products. By the 1830s, the annual average value of gum exports was already more than five times the value of slave exports at their peak, and alongside the revived gum trade were remarkable increases in the export of gold, hides, ivory, and beeswax, with the ground› nuts that were to be the major export by mid-century also beginning to make an appearance. 3\nThese changes in foreign trade made enormous differences in the local economies as well, shifting income from those who had once profited from the slave trade to new groups who were in a position to profit from the new production. From the late eighteenth century, and for reasons that were at least partially independent of the European factor, Islam began to gain a new dynamism; The peasantry began to convert en masse, partly as a form of protest against the aristocracy that was seeking to profit from the new economic currents by raiding the peasantry rather than protecting it. Senegambian societies thus found themselves caught between two new forces, a newly aggressive Islam and the new economic influences of a world economy being overturned and remade by the forces of indus› trialization.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Perhaps the two best examples of this power shift occurred in the northern states of Undi and Kazembe.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""The traditional compartmentalization between largely non-com› mercialized agricultural production and the long-distance trade in nonagricultural (luxury) products remained the rule even in those cases where there were small European agricultural settler communities, such as the prazeros in the Zambezi valley or the Boers on the Cape coast.\nThe one zone in which the economic situation was somewhat different was those parts of West and Central Africa where communities had begun to participate in the slave trade. The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""As long as Africa was 'outside' the world-economy, the 'cost' of a slave to the slave-owner was the expense of procurement plus maintenance plus supervision (prorated for his/her life as a slave) divided by total work output during his/her life as a slave.

Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy. The first long economic and geographic expan› sion of the capitalist world-economy had occurred between 1450 and 160050. In that period, no part of Africa could be said to have been part of this historical system. The period 1600/50-1730/50 was, for the capitalist worldeconomy, a period of relative stagnation, of taking a breath, of consolidation, primarily within the geographic zones that had already been included in the sixteenth century. It was still largely true at this time that no part of Africa could be said to have been incorporated into this system (with the reservations noted about the changing structure of the slave trade). 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift. The Angolan coast was involved in a major way as of the sixteenth century, the Bight of Benin only as off. 1650, the Gold Coast as of c. 1700, the Bight of Biafra as off. 1740. The Sierra Leone coast, involved early, was a significant exporter only as of the middle of the eighteenth century. South-east Africa became a major source only in the nineteenth century. procedures for obtaining their quarry. At some point, therefore, production and political systems in West and Central Africa began to be adjusted as a function of these now continuing economic ties. When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A West African Store', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The following list of goods comprises the leading and more important articles that go to make up the varied contents of a West African store-keeper's establishment.

Owing to the presence of German missionaries in these two Protectorates for about half a century, the natives have gradually accustomed themselves to wear European clothing. The percentage of those thus dressed increases from year to year. Formerly mostly ready-made clothes were imported, but now the natives have begun to buy the stuffs and cut out their own attire for themselves. Of these stuffs very various kinds and qualities are imported. It is necessary to keep as much as possible to the same classes of goods. The far greater portion of these wares are derived from German factories. Herr Halbig, a merchant in Otzymbinque, purchased a large quantity of these goods in Germany, and disposed of them with rapidity and at prices considerably lower than those quoted in Cape Town. The same gentleman impresses upon German manufacturers the fact that the natives in the Protectorates of Namaqualand and Damaraland are already half civilized, and only purchase those goods with which they are accustomed to supply their needs. Damaras and Namaquas are no longer childish savages who barter for gay toys and articles they cannot utilize. On the contrary, they pay special attention to the quality and durability of their purchases, and when they have the choice, constantly prefer expensive heavy goods to cheap articles. The present state of trade in the Protectorates is not a very favourable one. In consequence of the direct railway lines which have connected Cape Town for some years with the interior of Africa, cattle can be brought to the Cape Town market at much cheaper prices than they can be supplied from Namaqualand and Damaraland. These countries, however, possess hardly any other export articles. Herr Lüderitz, moreover, when he founded his factory in Angra-Pequena made a mistake of importing wares of an inferior quality, which found no sale among the natives. The failure of the cattle trade injured the credit of numerous Namaqua and Damara as well as Cape Town firms to such a degree that they could no longer command a supply of European wares. And the consequence is that there is a great lack in the Protectorates of European goods, while the merchants are in possession of large herds of cattle for which there is no sale. So soon, however, as the German trading companies have their slaughter-houses in full working order and are thus enabled to barter goods for oxen, the situation will be changed. The entire import trade of European goods will then naturally fall into the lap of the German dealers. It will then be their business so to utilize their opportunities that their position becomes assured and every rival undertaking impossible. The import of European wares must of course remain the chief end and aim of their endeavours, the slaughter-houses being only a means for exploiting the cattle which they receive as payment. The advent of the miners to the newly-discovered gold mines on German protected territory is also looked forward to as likely to prove highly advantageous to the German import trade. Considerable attention has been paid lately to the export trade from Namaqualand in gum arabic, which has proved highly profitable. Herr Raedecker, of Otzymbinque, has agreed to supply 10,000 lbs. of this article every year. Nara kernels, the fruit of the nara, are also exported in large quantities and converted in Cape Town into confectionery, which forms a sort of substitute for sweet almonds. Export in the horns and skins of wild beasts is also considerable. The principal markets for these goods are Rehobat and Omaruru. Herr Conradt describes the attitude of the natives of Namaqua, and more particularly Damara, as hostile to the German settlers.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1888#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.601, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MAYUMBA, ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'What a delightful thing it is to be, for even a short time, in a country where money has no value! Such is the case here. A shilling would buy nothing, a couple of glasses of rum a great deal. Truly this barter trade is a highly interesting one: interesting as regards the system, and doubly interesting as regards the articles trafficked in. First and foremost, of course, come Manchester cotton goods, then beads, old English military uniforms, cast-off clothing of all descriptions, china or rather delf ""ornaments"" of the roughest kind, perfumes such as ""kiss me quick,"" ""spring flowers,"" ""ess. bouquet,"" ""frangipanni,"" &c., got up in very gaudy bottles, filled with the most filthy and most noxious smelling compounds, trade tobacco, trade gin, and trade rum, the latter two beverages principally composed of vitriol, which causes them to bite, and for this reason makes them a sine qua non to the native soul, or rather stomach. In fact, spirit is the only article that causes the African to trade at all. Cloths, beads, perfumes, &c., he could and would do without, rather than work, but having once tasted gin or rum, they become to him a necessity of his existence, without which he does not find life worth living. All\n\nthe philanthropists, teetotal or temperance societies, will never succeed in eradicating alcohol from Africa. Rightly or wrongly, it has got there; it appears to be the only incentive to the native to work, and as long as he must have it and competition exists, he will be certain to get it.\n\nOne pleasing feature of this part of the West Coast of Africa is the really excellent sport that can be obtained. This is the gorilla country, the only portion of the earth in which that wonderful and almost human animal can be obtained; and besides it, elephants, panthers, hippopotami, chimpanzees, monkeys of all kinds, deer, gazelles, wild pig, and various other animals, are abundant, and comparatively easy to be got at. Fortunately, the natives, as a rule, are not huntsmen, or of a sporting disposition. Fetishism is so imbued in them that the killing of wild animals is an operation only to be engaged in after long and anxious consultation, and payment to the fetish man of their village or town; so that the experiment is not often indulged in, and the animals are allowed to roam about practically untouched. This part of the world is, therefore, an El Dorado for the sportsman, and with a couple of good weapons, sufficient time, and enough zeal, both a plenty and a variety of game can be obtained.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1886#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

In this state it is called green ivory. It is not so white as the kinds called white ivory, which have been lying a longer time exposed to the heat of the sun until the animal matter has disappeared. The excellence of green ivory consists in its greater toughness and in its growing whiter by age, instead of yellow, as is the case with the whiter varieties. Yet buyers of cutlery, through ignorance of these qualities, usually prefer the whiter kinds, which on that account are more in demand for the Sheffield trade, and have more than doubled in price since 1879.\n\nThe sales of ivory occur every three months at London and Liverpool, and sales are also held at irregular intervals at Rotterdam. At Liverpool, only ivory of the best quality is offered. Buyers from Germany and France and agents of American consumers attend these sales; and it is estimated that about one quarter of the whole amount goes to Sheffield, another quarter to London, and the other half to Germany, France, and the United States. There is just now great anxiety as to the future supply of ivory. The stocks in public warehouses are smaller than for many years past, and the rapid increase in prices is causing great anxiety to manufacturers. At a recent sale at Liverpool, the best African ivory sold by the ton at over 12s. 6d. per pound. This will explain the fact that the principal factor in the value of the best table cutlery is the handle. When the ivory comes into the hands of the cutler, much skill is required to make the most of the material, and every scrap is turned to account. After cutting out the scales of all sizes for pocket-knives, and the solid handles for table cutlery, the small pieces are usually sold to the button-makers, or may be made into pearls. These latter are the small pieces of ivory, pearl, or horn inserted into the handles of tea and coffee pots as non-conductors of heat, and are so called because they were originally made of pearl. The fine sawdust is sold for fertilising purposes, for the manufacture of gelatine, and for making a sizing used in the manufacture of lace fabrics.

Indeed, the colonial powers went out of their way to promote and encourage the adoption of modern money in three main ways. These, according to Hopkins, were 'by demonetising traditional currencies; by paying [the] expanding labour force in European coin; and by insisting on receiving taxes in cash rather than in kind'. 67 These methods proved very successful and by 1910 European currencies were widespread in West Africa. In the British colonies these consisted of a wide variety of English coins. In 1912, the West African Currency Board was established to supply currencies to British West Africa. In 1913, the Board issued its first coins of the denominations of 2s, is, 6d and 3d and three years later its first currency notes. In British East Africa, the British at first introduced the currency system operating in British India. In 1920, however, one currency board was established to issue coins and notes for the three colonies. It should be noted that all these currencies were linked with sterling in London.\nOne important consequence of the increasing use of currencies was the introduction of banking institutions in British Africa.

In the first place, even by the 1930s, a new standard of wealth had been introduced which was based not only on the number of sheep or cows or yams one possessed but on actual cash. Secondly, people were engaged in activities not for subsistence alone but also to earn money which, in turn, led, as will be seen later, to the emergence of a new class of wage earners and salaried groups.

That the number and the importance of merchants increased cannot be doubted. What is not clear is the extent to which a merchant or capitalist class may be said to have emerged. The tradition of long-distance trading with caravan centres and organization for security, provisioning, credit facilities, transportation and so on was already well established in North and West Africa and was developing rapidly in Central and East Africa in the nineteenth century. These developments occurred in Islamic areas where book-keeping was in Arabic, as well as in the old slave-trading parts of West Africa where the languages of commerce were European languages, and in areas of East Africa where Swahili was expanding as the language of commerce. There is evidence that in parts of the coastal areas of West Africa slave labour was beginning to be supplemented by expanding older forms of enforced labour, where money is loaned in return for a 'hostage' whose labour served partly as interest on the loan and partly as a guarantee that the loan would eventually be repaid. It was indicative of the increasing importance of the groups of merchants and of banking services that this type of enforced labour was greatly expanded in scope. It is said that by the 1870s on the Gold Coast, the system began to rival slave labour in significance, slavery being the method of recruiting labour from outside the immediate com› munity, and the system of 'hostages' for recruiting labour from within the community itself.$^{22}$ Yet, outside of the North African coastal cities, a distinct merchant class was slow in evolving. In the areas influenced by Christianity and European ideas, a group of merchants similar to the Victorian middle class began to emerge. But even in those places, apart from Sierra Leone and Liberia, such merchants seeking influence and power within the traditional states did so largely by obtaining chieftaincy titles within the evolving state structures. In many parts of the Sudan and Senegambia, the dominant merchants were closely connected with Muslim religious leaders, and there was not a distinct merchant class but rather a clerical merchant class. In other places there was no clear division between the merchants and the warriors and the ruling elite.

The slaving zones from Senegal to Sierra Leone, from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Nigeria and from the Congo river to Angola were the stretches of coast› line first encroached upon by the European colonizers. In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves. Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

Portugal was almost completely out of the reckoning, while the United States considerably expanded on its nineteenth-century involvement in African trade. Competitive and monopolistic tendencies were juxtaposed in the shipping world. By sub› sidies and special shipping laws, countries sought to ensure that colonial commerce increased the tonnage of national shipping. Yet, early in the present century 'Conference lines' emerged as agencies for resolving competition and establishing monopolies over freight rates. Weaker nations had little or no representation within the Conference lines, while the Germans were major participants even after the loss of their African colonies. 13 Banks were the pinnacle of early monopoly capitalism. They constituted the principal avenues for the export of African surplus, there being no obstacles to the free flow of capital funds out of the colonies. Private banks initially issued the specie in circulation in most colonies, until this became a central bank function with the establishment of statutory currency boards. The treasuries of the colonizing powers manipulated the currency reserves of the colonies in their own interests and ultimately in the interest of finance capital, since the investment of colonial reserves was made on the metropolitan money market.

By 1827, however, an embryonic development process had started. The main emphasis was laid, at first, on the production of food, and especially of rice, but efforts were also directed towards the cultivation of export crops and the exploitation of local natural resources: in the first category there were sugar, ginger and indigo, and in the second there were coffee and exotic timber. An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Sierra Leone and Liberia', 'content': ""The first generation had coped with the problems of creating a viable new society from scratch.

As the seat of the colonial government and the naval Vice-Admiralty, the victualling base for the naval patrol, and the official liberation centre for the Mixed Commissions, Freetown and the interior could count on a more or less regular injection of subsidies. MacCarthy improved the early villages and built new ones, where new arrivals were adopted and settled down among brothers.

Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade.

Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium.

Early on March 15, the field piece at Aro gate gave the alarm to Abeokuta; and at about seven a.m. the Dahomans attacked. The battle appears to have lasted until about eleven in the morning, but the Dahoman attack was weak and badly supported. The Dahomans were soon put to the rout, abandoning everything in their retreat, the King himself narrowly escaping capture. The Egbas pursued beyond Ishagga, killing many and making a great number of prisoners. The Dahoman loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners is said to amount to four thousand, which statement is probably not exaggerated.

That a ""Bank for West Africa"" should have left the realms of imagination for those of fact will have surprised some of them, but gratified still more. It is now not far from twenty years since we began to urge, both publicly and privately, the advantages and necessity of such an institution; and in our number of February 1st of this present year we announced by a leader that arrangements were in progress, of such a nature as gave us the conviction that the time of realization was at hand. Now, we have advanced another stage, and the ""Bank of West Africa"" is an established fact—a reality—and we congratulate our West African friends in especial that it is so. It had become monstrous that West Africa was not allied with Great Britain in banking operations; that with commercial relations of magnitude between the two, with weekly steam mail communication between Liverpool and all the West African ports, and a constantly increasing intercourse, West African commerce with Great Britain, and through the latter with European Continental ports, should still be left without any of those aids which independent capital was giving to merchant and trader in almost every other part of the world. Thanks chiefly to the indomitable persistence of Mr. C. Rosenbush, who appears in the prospectus as manager of the bank, this great reproach of West Africa is now to cease. Yet once again the old French proverb, ""Everything comes to him who knows how to wait,"" has received justification. For seventeen long years, to our personal knowledge, Mr. Rosenbush has been endeavouring to endow London and West Africa with this financial bond. His father having been the first to introduce banking operations on the West Coast of Africa, at Sierra Leone, Mr. Rosenbush has an hereditary claim to the position he holds in this new institution; which, if successful, as it ought to be, and we believe will be, will, we are convinced, owe no small portion of its success to his management; for the duties attached to which we know that he has been assiduously preparing himself throughout the long years of probation above mentioned. In our leader of February 1st last we entered so fully upon the enumeration of the benefits that ought to flow to West Africa, and its now important interests by the establishment in London of a bank for that portion of the world of commerce, that it is not necessary we should do so here. There is, indeed, an ample field for safe and lucrative banking operations, within the limits to which they should be strictly confined; and we ought not to be in error when we anticipate for the bank a degree of success commensurate therewith. As with all kindred institutions this bank will, no doubt, be subject to strong temptations to action beyond those limits; but with directors, most of whom have had West African experience, and especially with a manager so intimately acquainted with the trading life of Sierra Leone, we hope and believe it will never fall into them. The line, the safe line, between commercial transactions and banking business is very clearly defined for those who choose to see and regard it, and no just ground of complaint ought to be given by the bank to the large mercantile houses doing business on the Coast, who will, we believe, find that the bank may render them a very valuable aid. This bank is not established with the view of adding one more competitor in the field of African trade and commerce, but as an auxiliary to all who are engaged therein. What are the facilities which it is believed the bank will especially offer? They are, if we do not understand the real position, to enable the West African trader who has a capital of £100 to quadruple his engagements, and do as much business as he could do with £400 unassisted by the bank. At present the trader with his £100 who desires to obtain his legitimate amount of gain by his business purchases produce and sends that to England, waiting for the proceeds of the produce to reach him in the shape of goods he has ordered. In this case it is quite clear he loses all the time between the date of his shipment on the Coast and that on which he gets the return goods into his possession. By the action and assistance of the bank, however, he may obtain on his verified shipment and deposit of bill of lading a portion of the money value of that produce in silver. Silver coin is now much esteemed by the native producers, as they can exchange it at will for the British manufactured goods—rum, gin, beads, powder, &c.—at the stores of the large importing merchants. With that portion of the money value thus obtained he can trade again, while his original £100 investment is on its way to Liverpool; and may, perhaps, be making a second shipment before his first reaches that port. It seems to us that this will be the legitimate working of the system of bank facilities on the West Coast, and that if the large import houses be reasonable in their scale of profits, they may consequently do, by this indirect aid of the bank, a much larger business than they have ever hitherto done. It is quite clear that the £100 man would not benefit much by the aid of the bank if he were to wait the receipt of goods purchased by the proceeds of his produce in England, and that he is therefore not likely to be an importer for anything more than what can be purchased by some commercial agent in England with the balance which the bank, acting under the consignor\'s orders, will hand over to him, after having satisfied its claim for the advances made by its establishment on the Coast, with expenses, &c. We are very anxious that the bank shall obtain a very great success; and this not only without injury to any existing interests on the West Coast, but by conferring benefits upon it. In the establishment of banking operations there we always calculated on the bank branches becoming the receivers and depositories of the colonial revenues, as pointed out in our leader before referred to. This will, of course, only be realised by the bank being conducted with so much prudence and wish such an entire absence of commercial risks and commitments as shall justify the Government authorities in placing full confidence in the institution. This is a matter of considerable importance. Not only are the revenues of good amount—Sierra Leone, £100,000; the Gold Coast, £100,000; Lagos, £50,000; the Gambia, £25,000; but the bank, having the confidence of the Government, will inspire confidence in the general population, so necessary to its becoming a trusted bank of deposits and issue; putting an end to the native custom of hoarding coin under the soil of their habitations. But to be this ""trusted bank"" it must keep its resources well in hand, and not make too many advances on real property. We must be excused for pointing out this danger to a bank. It is not necessary, nor would it be becoming in us, to do more than merely mention it. A word to the wise is as good as a volume; and, moreover, we feel confidence in Mr. Rosenbush in this matter. And now we have only to wish the bank ""good speed."" We shall watch it—its operations and its progress—with a deep, true interest in its welfare and prosperity. All West Africa is interested in that prosperity. Almost everything that can be accomplished by capital has yet to be effected there. We made this statement in our February number, adding further, ""All the aids and appliances of civilization for facilitating communications between the Coast and the interior, for economising labour, for the transport of goods and produce, and for the development of the abounding natural and mineral resources, have yet to be introduced; and a well-established bank, giving large dividends to its shareholders, will surely...', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.757, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BANK FOR BRITISH WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""extensive. Every year the missionary schools discharge a number of educated men and women who almost invariably embark in trade. Most of them have some small capital, which they use to trade with the interior natives, and the produce they thus obtain they either ship on consignment to England, to obtain the proceeds in British and other goods and silver coin, or sell it to the large British and foreign mercantile houses on the Coast, receiving goods from them in exchange for a renewal of operations with the producers in the interior. These native traders almost universally prefer to remit their produce to Europe for sale; but in this they labour under the great disadvantage of having their capital locked up until they obtain from Europe the proceeds of the sales, in goods or money. They estimate their loss through such delays at something like 25 per cent., and there can be no doubt that the facilities a bank might safely afford would be productive of great gain, both to the traders and the bank; while, if the limits of our article would permit, we could point out how the European mercantile establishments may also be largely benefited thereby. To every one acquainted with the business of the West Coast, and the mode in which it is conducted, it is patent that the establishment of a well-conducted bank, with adequate capital, will lead to a greatly increased production on the West Coast—in a few years, it may be, to 100 per cent. increase. A bank, moreover, that is capable of offering ample guarantees for the safety of moneys deposited with it, cannot fail of being highly useful to the public service as bankers to the several Administrations, receiving from the Colonial Treasurers the proceeds of the Customs' duties and other sources of revenue, and holding them at the disposal of the Government in the shape most convenient to the latter. Such a bank will link West Africa, now isolated, with the great financial system of the civilized world, giving her a recognized position therein—a fact of enormous importance for the British West African Settlements, when we consider that almost everything that can be accomplished by capital has yet to be effected there. All the aids and appliances of civilization for facilitating communications between the Coast and the interior, for economizing labour, for the transport of goods and produce, and for the development of the abounding natural and mineral resources, have yet to be introduced; and a well-established bank, giving large dividends to its shareholders, will show European capital the way to further profitable investment in those too long neglected countries. We have always steadfastly maintained that ere many years the West Africa Settlements will take rank among the most valuable colonial possessions of Great Britain, and every fresh step towards the realization of this prediction is to us a source of real delight. The bank is such a step, and we shall welcome it with all our heart. We can assure it, too, a welcome all along the West Coast, to which it cannot fail to prove a benefactor. Our only regret at this moment is, that it will not be brought before the public in time for us to advertise it more fully in this number of our journal. But we have sounded the note of preparation, and our readers may confidently await its beneficial advent."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE BANK OF WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Bank of West Africa! Such, we are informed, is the title of a projected bank, for which an Ordinance of Incorporation has been obtained from the Legislative Council at Sierra Leone. So badly had we been served by our friends in Sierra Leone in this matter, that the first intimation of such a banking project having passed through the preliminary Sierra Leone stage, was made casually to us in London on the 17th inst. We felt immediately that it was a matter which, in the interest of the people of West Africa, and of those connected with trade and commerce there, would demand our close attention. Messrs. Child, Mills, and Co., of Manchester, were named to us as the organizers of the project, demanders of the Incorporation Ordinance at Sierra Leone, and now of the approval of Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, without which the project must fall to the ground.

At the time we wrote we believed a much larger amount of the capital had been secured by applications for shares than proved to have been actually the case. We had been so far misinformed. Nevertheless, the amount of capital subscribed would have been sufficient for commencing operations, and proving by results whether banking institutions on the West Coast of Africa would, or would not, pay. Our own convictions on the subject are well known. We believed that by a supply of banking facilities at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos, as was contemplated, the operations of native traders would be greatly extended, perhaps doubled or trebled, and this without injury to the large European firms established in those places, who would continue to be the great importers of European and other goods, provided they sold them to the traders at reasonably remunerative prices. This, however, is well known not to be the opinion of those firms, who regarded a bank as a direct attack on their trade. Opposition, covert and open, met the bank on the publication of the prospectus. It was spoken against by them in no measured terms, and denounced in the public press by one of their agents as a monstrous conception that could only end in total failure. This opposition, which naturally enough interfered with the application for shares in the proposed bank, seems to have been too much for the moral courage of the Directors. Disputes and differences, we are told, arose among them, and so many of them resigned their seats at the Board before the day of allotment of shares, that the allotment made has been declared illegal by a competent judicial tribunal, with the result that the money paid on application for shares has been returned to the subscribers, and the projected bank has been judicially interred. We are greatly sorry for the just disappointment which the untimely fate of this infant bank will give rise to. The native traders everywhere down the West Coast have sufficient intelligence to comprehend the great benefits such an institution would have conferred, and we sympathize heartily with them under the injury they have thus sustained. Nor can we encourage any hope of a renewed effort, for, at least, some considerable time to come, to establish a Joint Stock Bank for banking operations on the West Coast of Africa. The failure of such an effort as that which has been lately made, closes the market for a time against any similar operation for the West Coast, the traders on which must resign themselves to the actual, and endeavour to be the best they may be able through the great facilities now afforded by weekly steam communication with Europe. At the same time everything must be done, and if we continue the publication of this paper, we will do our part in the work, to prove to the monied people in Great Britain that there is a wide and constantly expanding field on the West Coast for the profitable employment of capital, the judicious application of which is alone wanting for developing natural and mineral resources which will at no very distant period cast those of other tropical possessions of Great Britain deeply into shade. We shall not live to see this; but many of our younger readers will probably live to remember that we have held out this promise to Africa, and to the world at large. By our mental vision we behold in the not remote future a West Coast Africa, with which the actual one can only compare as a dwarf with a giant. Its proximity to Europe, the fertility of its soil, the variety of its rich and valuable products, insure this result. We can therefore conscientiously preach patience, but patience with exertion. Every educated African ought to regard himself as one of the appointed workers for bringing about this result. We rejoice to think we see reason to believe that those who have now the benefits of advanced education are comprehending this. A few years ago and those who obtained that advantage seemed to think that its only value was to enlarge the sphere of their personal enjoyments, and the circle of their pleasures. But now there is evidence of expanding ideas. We have before us at this moment a pamphlet, printed at Liverpool by George Philip & Son, for the author, Samuel Lewis, B.L., of Sierra Leone. It is the substance of a lecture delivered by him at the Wesleyan High School, on ""The Agricultural Position of Sierra Leone."" It gives a good and luminous account of the progress of agriculture in Sierra Leone, from the period when Granville Sharp and Wilberforce raised the Sierra Leone Company. Until within the last two or three years the progress had been slow and fitful, the easily cultivated root ginger being almost the only exportable produce. More strenuous efforts are now, however, being made. Sugar, coffee, and cocoa plantations have been commenced. This has been Sierra Leone\'s great need if she could ever expect to rise to eminence. The concluding paragraphs of Mr. Lewis\'s lecture give evidence that the author fully comprehends the need, and the only true way of supplying it. He says: ""To succeed, agriculture must be taken up as a serious undertaking. The purpose of this paper will have been served if it succeed in inducing the conviction that the true causes of our backwardness in agriculture are remediable, and not inherent evils; capable of being cured by knowledge, assiduity in business, and a careful but not grudging economy of time, labour, and money, which only constant supervision can secure."" With every advance in agriculture at Sierra Leone, with every step in the progress of development of natural resources in the other colonies and West Coast Settlements, the want of banking institutions will be more and more felt, and a more successful effort will no doubt then be made to establish a ""Bank of West Africa.""', 'last_edit_date': '1881-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1881#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Parcel Post with the Oil Rivers Protectorate', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""It is evident that in a trade which has its foundation on the barter system the value and quantity of the imports must vary directly with the exports. There is of late years a growing tendency on the part of the native, even in the remote interior, to employ silver currency for his transactions in place of direct barter or the cumbrous method of transporting vast quantities of cowrie shells from market to market. Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods. The attention of the natives has been directed lately to the importance of developing minor industries.

Not the least important among the benefits that such facilities afford is the anticipatory realization of values, by which capital comes in to assist the operations of industry at the price of a share in its profits. By the discount of bills of exchange drawn by importers, manufacturers, and other producers on their customers for the value of commodities transferred, the working capital of the importer, manufacturer, or other producer or trader, is set free a certain number of days or months before it would otherwise be so, and made again available for other operations. A mutual benefit is thus conferred—a benefit that has not unfrequently made it possible to realize a fortune where, otherwise, a mere hard subsistence only might have been obtained. That such facilities are occasionally abused, in times of speculative mania, by being made instrumental to an illegitimate increase in the value of commodities, to be followed by subsequent ruinous depression, merely affords an additional evidence of a fact universally known, that a good instrument may be, and is, often used for a bad purpose. The instrument is not to be blamed, but only the improper use made of it. Thus, many drugs which are a great boon to suffering humanity when properly and carefully administered, may become instruments of death in inexperienced or wicked hands. A system by which 100l. sterling may be made to do the work of 400l. or 500l., ought to be, and must be when only legitimately employed, exceedingly beneficial to an honest and prudent manufacturer or trader of limited means, giving a fair chance of success in the world's strife where, but for it, there could not be any possibility of such success. It may not enable the trading dwarf to rise to the height of the giant, but it may prevent the giant from crushing him to death under his feet. Penetrated by this truth, established by experience, we, nearly twenty years ago endeavoured to obtain banking facilities for the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa. It is not necessary to enumerate here the various difficulties that suggested themselves, and which, at that period, and at later periods, were insurmountable; nor shall we enter upon any details of the Banking Scheme of 1872, which it became our duty to denounce and oppose, as being fraught with extreme danger to the legitimate trading interests in those settlements, as well as to those who might have been induced to invest their money therein. There were two points on which we insisted then, as we insist now, and the difficulty of obtaining a full satisfaction on which deterred us on subsequent occasions. Those two points are, a perfect security for the banking capital employed, and that the bank should not be instrumental to the establishment of a commercial monopoly. This latter it would have become in the hands of any one of the large European trading firms established on the Coast, and we could not see our way clear to obtaining adequate guarantees for the former. The ultimate failure of any banking operations undertaken in the British settlements, owing to the want of adequate security, would have been an evil of such magnitude that we felt it was better for the Coast to struggle on without banking facilities than that there should be danger of such a result; and we felt, moreover, that in the course of events the time would come when our reasonable demands as regards a bank could be satisfied. That time, it seems to us, has now arrived. We see no reason to doubt that a perfect security for banking capital may now be obtained without the bank being made the instrument of commercial monopoly. A weekly steam communication between England and all the settlements on the West Coast, with telegraphic communication with Madeira, distant only four or five days from Sierra Leone, will enable the Board of Directors in London to maintain a constant and efficient control over the African establishments; while the facility it offers for a change of climate in the event of sickness removes any difficulty that may have been previously suggested as regards the health of European bank officials there. There is also a higher class of native Africans now capable of furnishing adequate guarantee for their honesty and fidelity than existed a few years ago. The fuller the consideration we give to the subject, the more firmly convinced are we that the bank now about to be established, if properly conducted—as, from the constitution of the Board of Directors which has been submitted to us, we have no doubt it will be—may be expected within a few years to rank as one of the most successful of British Colonial banks having their seat of Direction in London. The elements of success that the bank will command are now very considerable, and becoming year by year more"", 'last_edit_date': '1881-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""RIVERS NUNEZ, PONGAS, MELLICOURIE, SCARCIES, AND SHERBRO'."", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We are glad to see that the two Steam Companies, the African and the British and African, have made arrangements for regular communications, by branch steamers, in connection with the weekly Liverpool steamers, between Sierra Leone and the above-mentioned rivers; the hope also being held out of the Branch steamer calling at other rivers in the neighbourhood if adequate inducement be offered. This arrangement can scarcely fail to increase the trade and revenue of Sierra Leone. It had become particularly necessary, indeed indispensable, as regards the Sherbro', which has so very considerable a trade, and which has so often suffered vexatious and hurtful delays in the transmission of letters, owing to official caprice at Sierra Leone. The regularity and certainty derived by steam communication is so beneficial in commercial affairs, that there is little, if any, room for doubt that within a very few years steam will have almost entirely superseded sailing craft in the commerce of the West Coast of Africa.

We inserted that letter with the intention of referring to it this month, because we deem it better that no vain illusions should prevail on a question of so much importance. We begin by asking another question, What is there to pay for the accommodation to be offered by a bank in Lagos? This is the consideration that lies at the very root of the matter; but which we fear has been very little thought of by those who desire the advent of such an institution. There can be no doubt that banks offer great facilities to commerce. But banks are not philanthropic institutions. They are simply establishments that trade in their own and other people\'s money, deriving their profits from the employment of that money. When the magnitude of the trade of Lagos is put forward as the reason why there ought to be a banking institution there, it becomes necessary to inquire what the nature of that trade is; whether it is such as requires, and would reward banking facilities. There can, we believe, be no doubt that since the ruin that fell upon native traders in Lagos by the closing of the interior markets (caused by the very gross error committed by the British Government and the local British authorities) in 1872-3, the great bulk of the Lagos commerce is carried on by a few opulent European houses; and others who have European agents in Lagos. Now these houses and people, instead of looking for or desiring banking facilities in Lagos, are the very parties who would most strenuously oppose their introduction. A bank that would advance money, as suggested in the letter alluded to, on the security of bills of lading for produce sent to England for realization, would interfere in no small degree with their business, one of the elements of which is the purchase of that produce. There is nothing, therefore, to be hoped or looked for by a bank, in the shape of co-operation or support in that quarter. Is the residue of the trade, that which is carried on by native import and export traders, at present of sufficient magnitude—or if doubled or quadrupled, would it then be of sufficient magnitude—to support a bank? because those who desire and advocate the introduction of a bank, must bear in mind that a bank must be itself supported, as well as support others by its operations. A bank, to be of any real utility, must possess a considerable capital. This capital would require guardianship and administration of a special and expensive character; since only in such could it find security.

From Lagos, Accra, Sierra Leone, and Bathurst, the complaint is the same—a depression in all branches of commerce which is altogether unparalleled in the history of our trading stations. In an article upon this subject, in our September number, we endeavoured to lay before our readers some of the causes—those especially which admit of remedy—which led to this distressing state of things. We say especially those admitting of remedy, for it must be conceded that much of this depression arises from causes entirely beyond our control, and the effect of which is felt more or less acutely in all our great commercial centres. In the first place, then, we have undoubtedly the apathy of the Government, to whom, it is to be feared, Africa, being out of sight, was very often ""out of mind."" But let us hope we shall soon see an improvement in this respect, now that direct telegraphic communication is at length established between London and the West Coast. Next we have to consider the unfair competition to which the genuine trader or merchant finds himself subjected by his dishonest rival, who, having no intention of paying for the goods he has succeeded in obtaining, can very well afford to undersell him who purposes to meet his engagements. Undoubtedly, this is fostered by an undue extension of the credit system. Upon another page will be found some correspondence upon this subject which goes to show how vast is the injury worked by the credit (!) system when not properly safe-guarded. One of our correspondents—""A Patriot""—observes, quoting from the Lagos Times of four years ago: ""It would be difficult, and it is altogether unadvisable, to abolish the credit system, root and branch, from the trade, as sometimes there may be very deserving cases that may be properly helped with a credit; but it is most certainly undesirable that the system should rule trading relations altogether, as it has done."" This, we must say, appears rather too severe upon credit as a system. Without credit there would be little or no room for commercial enterprise; but credit overdone, which fosters dishonesty, or even that carelessness which is so closely allied to it, is sure to damage both him who gives and him who takes. Another correspondent—""R. W.""—points out that the commerce of Africa is at present in a transition state, and, like all transition, has some of the evils of both the old and new systems. He goes on to argue, very reasonably, that the local Government authorities might do much to improve the present condition of things by initiating improvements in the country by forming new roads and bridges, and possibly, where needed, harbours. He points out that things were much better ten or eleven years ago, after the conclusion of the Ashanti War, even in spite of the consequent loss of the interior trade; and this he attributes to the facility for purchasing goods which was a consequence of the Government paying so much to those engaged in the war operations. As to the enforcement of a better system of education, the desirability of which our correspondent alludes to, the conditions of life vary so much in each of our West Coast colonies, and from that in England, that it is impossible to see how any universal system of national education is to be maintained; and this much is certain—the effect of an improved education would only be shown very gradually, and as the present generation passing away would leave room for the fuller development of its successor. The formation of a bank, under Government auspices, would doubtless act as a great incentive to an improvement in commerce, for one of the chief difficulties of the smaller African trader at the present time is in obtaining drafts upon London and Liverpool merchants to enable him to settle claims in England. There may be many other causes more or less answerable for this very unsatisfactory state of things, but there can be no doubt that honesty and integrity will go far towards bringing back to the British colonies on the West Coast that commercial prosperity which is so essential to the improvement of the African peoples.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE BANK OF WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'P.S.—Since writing the above, we hear that another effort is being made to establish a Bank for West Africa, and there is a strong probability of the effort proving successful.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1881#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

The accumulation of a huge public debt begun in 1858 was to finance the infrastructural projects as well as the extravagances of some of the monarchs. The law of liquidation of 1880 had fixed Egypt's public debt at £98.37 million and during the next twenty years a further £18.2 million was borrowed. Egypt's liabilities to foreigners had reached £E 8.5 million per annum by 1914.$^{a5}$ Establishing export surplus was vital to meet those liabilities.\nThe American Civil War stimulated the production and export of cotton in Egypt. Output increased from a little over half a million kantärs in i860 to over 2.1 million in 1865, to 4.1 million in 1890 and to 7.7 million in 1913. However, after the rapid increase in the price of cotton caused by the American Civil War, prices continued to fall until the end of the century and the rise in production was insufficient to offset the fall in prices. During the first decade of this century, cotton prices more than doubled, and the value of the crop rose to over three times what it had been at the beginning of the occupation. In 1916 cotton prices rose to an average of US $38 and again to US $90 per kantär in 1919; exports jumped to £E 88 million in 1920 and a large export surplus was built up. 56 The financial achievement of the British administration was to ensure the proper collection and administration of the increased revenues accruing to the government out of this surplus.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': 'who went into the interior and shipped them overseas, and vice-versa. 23 New export-oriented production necessarily implied new imports.

Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy.

Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930.

We shall begin rather with the case of Egypt. Prior to 1730, Egypt's production was part of the division of labour in the Ottoman world-empire. Egypt served as one of the granaries of this historical system as well as a major transit point in long-distance intercontinental luxury trade. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the internal contradictions of the Egyptian system, combined with a decline in demand for prior exports, had led to a fiscal crisis of the Egyptian state structure, and consequently to an increase in taxation, which thereupon led to peasant resistance through abandonment of lands. At the very same time, the expanding capitalist world-economy was seeking to include Egyptian production within its network. This effort was made concrete in the active military competition of France and England at the end of the eighteenth century to control the region. The Egyptian response took the form of the coming to power of Muhammad 'All and his attempt to 'modernize' Egypt.\nIn economic terms, this 'modernization' involved the establishment of a stable export of an agricultural good. For various reasons having to do with the comparative ecology and political structures of the capitalist worldeconomy, long-staple cotton was a better option for Egypt than wheat. But the large-scale production of cotton required a change not only in the irrigation system but also in the social relations of production. Muhammad 'All installed a state monopoly of trade with direct collection of taxes by salaried bureaucrats. This led to increasingly regulated control over peasant production practices, and impressment for work on infrastructure and for military service. Eventually this was converted into corvØe labour on private large estates, whose extent grew from about 10 per cent of the arable land in 1818 to about 45 per cent by 1844. This process was further intensified after the death of Muhammad 'Alï, continuing the expropriation of the peasantry, and culminating in the major peasant-supported 'Urabist revolt in 1881-2, itself one of the factors leading to the establishment of British colonial rule. The entire transformation of the productive process resulted in the creation of a sizeable stratum of landless rural workers, direct supervision of agricultural work, and a significant increase in total work time required of the peasantry. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'These were the major forces determining population change but there were undoubtedly others.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages. In 1894 half the total government revenue and 95 per cent of the customs duties of the Niger Coast Protectorate were derived from spirits; by 1894 the governmental income from this source totalled nearly £2 million.$^{46}$ Although the Brussels Act of 1892 tried unsuccessfully to limit the trade in the Congo (now Zaire), it was not successfully regulated in tropical Africa until the eve of the First World War.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""The great transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world did not occur with the late nineteenth-century partition by European powers. Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""The naval squadrons were less concerned about suppression than about their task of protecting the 'legitimate' trade of their own nationals.

Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Local artisanship suffered heavily from European competi› tion and manipulation, along lines already manifest in the pre-colonial period. As the colonial economy became firmly rooted in the 1920s, Africans were producing that which they did not consume and consuming that which they did not produce. In effect, domestic demand did not stimulate the maximization of domestic resources. As a further deleterious consequence, the colonizers wasted some African resources and ignored others, because their yardstick was the utility of the given resource to Europe rather than Africa. None of the major economic elements such as savings, investment, prices, incomes and output were correlated in response to domestic require› ments. For these structural reasons, recent research by African economists and historians has challenged the old formulations of colonial development and has posited instead that colonialism produced economic dependence, lopsidedness and underdevelopment. 14 The most significant event in the evolution of African economies in the inter-war period was the great depression of 1929-33.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy. The first long economic and geographic expan› sion of the capitalist world-economy had occurred between 1450 and 160050. In that period, no part of Africa could be said to have been part of this historical system. The period 1600/50-1730/50 was, for the capitalist worldeconomy, a period of relative stagnation, of taking a breath, of consolidation, primarily within the geographic zones that had already been included in the sixteenth century. It was still largely true at this time that no part of Africa could be said to have been incorporated into this system (with the reservations noted about the changing structure of the slave trade). 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""The coast had always exported palm oil, but in minute quantities.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

Reviewing the prospects of the approaching planting, that journal states that the production of cotton has reached a point where it is likely to bring loss to the planter, unless the natives of India, Brazil, and Egypt turn their attention to other pursuits. Cotton can be grown as cheaply in the South as elsewhere, the advantages of climate and soil being so superior as to more than counterbalance the high price of labour. But in a close contest cotton producers in India, Brazil, and Egypt will not be easily forced to abandon its culture. Their wants are few, they are content with small profits, and they will, in all probability, it thinks, continue to produce just enough cotton to overstock the world when the American annual crop exceeds 2,500,000 bales. The losses sustained by the South on the incoming crop have caused a general belief that in 1871 only a small crop will be planted. At present prices the planter has little or no profit. He has laboured during the year for the public; the world is benefited by cheap cotton, but he is not. The question is one of profit and loss, and if the belief is general in the South that present prices are normal and not likely to improve less cotton will be produced. It is too early yet to state with exactness the intention of planters. The _Picayune_, and, indeed, the whole country, expect to see a great reduction in cotton acreage, but nothing has yet transpired that warrants the assertion that such will really be the case. From all parts of the South there is intelligence of a strong demand for labour. Planters are securing all the available labour in their respective districts, showing that they are far from being discouraged, and that the whole laboring force of the South is likely to be fully employed this year. While many planters are holding out for a reduction of wages, others are paying last year's rates. These facts do not warrant the conclusion that a large cotton crop is in anticipation. The _Picayune_ says it can only infer that as much land as possible will be cultivated, and that planters expect a more prosperous year is in store for them. The land will be put under cotton, corn, or other staple, as the planter deems proper. In Louisiana, which produces more cotton to the acre than any other State, there will be a great increase in the production of sugar.

The yarn and cloth markets continue in a very healthy state owing to the plentiful and cheap supply of cotton. American cotton is in larger supply now, as compared with last year, by 54 per cent.; East India, 41 per cent.; and other description, 104 per cent.; while middling Orleans cotton is 31; fair Dholleras, 35; Brazil, 34; and Egyptian 33 per cent. cheaper than in 1870. This gives a wonderful impulse to the expansion of business, and so far during the present year the only check to production has been the limitation of machinery; or, rather, the supply of labour to keep it in full employment. Nearly all the best makers of yarn and cloth have been well supplied with orders during many months past, and still hold very considerable unfinished contracts, in some cases at prices which afford a margin for profit such as has not been known for many years. For instance, 27 inch 5lb. printing cloths, which in September last were sold at 5s. 6d. per piece, are still quoted at the same figures, although the raw material can be purchased nearly 2d. per lb. cheaper; 36 inch 7lb. shirtings are quoted at 8s. 11½d., as in September, and 8¼ lb. shirtings are still at 11s. 1½d., notwithstanding the reduction of New Orleans cotton from 9¼ to 7¾d. per lb.

This is the more cheering, as not long since there were serious apprehensions with regard to the cotton worm. A recent inquiry instituted by the United States Entomological Commission showed that since the war the ravages of this insect had amounted in the Southern States to damages equal to 15,000,000 dols. a year. In 1872 and 1873 this was checked by the use of Paris green and a refuse obtained in the manufacture of aniline colours. The latter has been found to be particularly effective and inexpensive, the material costing only five cents an acre; and the result is seen in the improved crop of these last two years. Besides this cause of improvement much is due to the large quantity of cotton grown and picked during the winter months, there having been virtually no winter, and in many sections the plant went on producing until it was time to sow the new crop. The home consumption of cotton this year is 1,803,805 bales, against 1,568,960 in 1879, and the exports to England 2,554,569, against 2,058,514.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Freight of Cotton from Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is especially our duty, as guardian of West African interests, to keep a vigilant watch upon commercial as well as administrative proceedings, that we may point the way to a removal of any impediment to that development of material resources on which the future welfare of the African countries so much depends. In doing this, one such impediment stands out in strong relief; while, in consequence of the rapid change now taking place in the mode of conducting the business of this country with West Africa, we feel convinced that it is only necessary we should throw a strong and just light upon it to lead to its speedy removal. This impediment is the rate of freight on cotton from West African countries to England. At the first glance it may be thought by the owners of steam and sailing ships trading with Africa that we are premature in mooting the subject of a reduction in the rates of freight on cotton. It may be urged by them that these rates have undergone a reduction of 50 per cent., and their first impulse will no doubt be to say that it is preposterous to expect they can be still further reduced. It is true, thanks to the British and African Steam Navigation Company, that the rate of freight on cotton is now 3d. per pound instead of 1¼d. per pound, as it was in the days of steam monopoly by the African Steamship Company; but, at the same time, it is equally true that the rate of 3d. per pound is still too high a rate for the products of an industry that needs to be nursed and encouraged, and is consequently an impediment to that increase in the growth of cotton in West Africa which is so desirable for the progress of the African countries and the interests of Great Britain. Only those who, thirsting for African advancement, were watching the onward march of African agricultural industry, were sensible of the great impediment to the cotton culture which 1¼d. per pound freight on cotton to England placed in its way. It was a grievous error of the African Steamship Company to impose such a freight on cotton. The earliest efforts made in cotton culture for exportation, under the munificent donation of Miss Burdett Coutts so ably applied by Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester, had established that cotton might be made in the course of time to figure largely in the exports of West Africa; that soil and climate favoured its growth, and that the natives in certain districts were willing to cultivate it for foreign markets. But 1¼d. per pound freight to Liverpool was a frightful obstacle, and the rate of progress was very slow until the disastrous civil war in America raised the price of New Orleans cotton from 5d. to above 2s. per pound. The African cotton from the Egba Countries is not much inferior to the New Orleans; it therefore approximated in value to the latter in the British markets, and the high price gave a stimulus to the African cotton industry which enabled it to triumph over the 1¼d. obstacle. Prices receded after the termination of the American war, but until lately they have been such as still to allow the production in Africa to progress, notwithstanding the 1¼d. and, later, as at present, 3d. freight. But the joint influence, temporarily of the European war, and, we believe permanently, of increased production in the United States, with the opening of new facilities of supply from India to England, via the Suez Canal, has caused a rapid fall in prices during the last few months, a fall which seems to point unmistakeably to prices somewhat similar to those which ruled immediately before the American struggle. We do not hesitate to say that this change of circumstance necessitates a change of rate of freight on cotton from Africa to England—necessitates it both in the interests of Africa and of the steam companies themselves. We are convinced that in what we are about to ask we are consulting their best interests. The interests of conveyers of produce from the Coast cannot be dissociated from those of the producers and traders. The African Steam Company did not see this heretofore; monopoly often creates blindness; but better counsels now prevail, a clearer sight has now been given, and we expect to see the now friendly rivals, the two great Steamship Companies, carefully watching the rise of any new agricultural industry in the African countries, and fostering and giving impetus to it by low rates of freight for the new product in the infancy of production. There are only three of the West African exports that depend entirely on what may be strictly called agricultural industry. These are ground-nuts, ginger, and cotton. The first of these has already established itself as a great staple, and may therefore be placed, more or less, although it has now a growing competition with the East Indies and other countries, in the same category with the grand staple, palm-oil, which may be left to take care of itself without any fear of prejudice thereby resulting to it. But cotton requires, demands, the nursing care of the shipowners. It has not, like palm-oil, a monopoly in European markets; it has to struggle against the organised production in America, the East Indies, Egypt, and other countries where a large capital and great facilities of transit, together with all the economising appliances which large capital only can command, give it great advantages. Under these circumstances it is to the interest, as we have before said, of this country, of the steam companies, and of Africa, that it should be treated with exceptional tenderness. And as the African advocate and guardian we earnestly ask this of them. We want to see this cotton industry so important to Great Britain, greatly and rapidly developed in the Egba, Yoruba, and Volta Countries. The latter, whenever a permanent pacification takes place, by the country becoming secured against Ashantee inroads, may be made a large cotton producer. Mr. J. C. Brandt, and one or two other Accra men, gave the first impulse, we believe, in Krepee, during the American war, and the German missionary traders followed profitably in the same path. The Ashantee invasion has for a time greatly impaired this industry, but there is every reason why, with so industrious a people as the Krepees, and good soil and climate, there should be a large exportation via the River Volta from Krepee, if the Steam Companies act on our suggestion. And we are not asking them to make any great present sacrifice to their own future and Africa's permanent interests. We are not going to ask them to bring cotton from Lagos or the Volta or Accra, to Liverpool, at freights lower than the average paid for cotton of other countries to that port. American cotton pays 7-16ths per pound freight by steamers from New York, or 3-16ths per pound by fast-sailing ships; African, even at the now reduced rates, pays 3d. per pound freight equally by the steamships and by those, for the most part, tubs of sailing ships, which manage to take three or four months, at best, to make the voyage. We are only asking them to do what is just and reasonable, and what will be to their own advantage in the long run."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-10-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN COTTON', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We must have cotton. Some national effort ought to be made for it. The war in America goes on in its hopeless course. Cotton production in the Southern States is under daily process of annihilation. All the boasted substitutes for cotton have proved to be no substitutes at all. At this time last year they cropped up with remarkable vigour, until we began to think Science would make the coveted fibre out of Canada deals. But all the fancied discoveries and inventions failed beneath the exactions of a practical manufacturing test. One real discovery alone remained. There is no substitute for cotton, but cotton. As America fails, and India cannot give the necessary abundance, every other source of supply must be stimulated. It is not a matter to be trifled with. The national energies should be evoked. We have again and again insisted on the national capacities of Africa to supply what America fails to send us. African cotton was the parent of American. It resembles it in the character of its fibre. It only requires a little more attention to its cultivation, gathering, and preparation in Africa to become a perfect and equally valuable substitute.\n\nWhy, then, it will be asked, do not our merchants take the necessary steps for procuring this desirable cotton in the desired quantities? The answer is simple enough. Those who risk the cost of establishing the industry in Africa will have to do it as much for others as for themselves. They will not be able to create a monopoly. It is not desirable that they should. When they shall have obtained a costly success, others will flock in upon the heels of the pioneers, and reap where they have sown. We have inquired largely into the subject. We have seen African cotton in the mills, and know its value. We have talked with the merchants who might be supposed to be the proper persons to undertake the procuring of it. Why cannot the cotton be got? And what is the reply? Just what ought to be expected from English merchants. It is only a question of pounds, shillings, and pence. There is not an adequate inducement.

Cocoa-nut oil from the East, and palm oil from Africa, came in to satisfy the increasing want. Tallow had advanced to such a price as sufficed to make the palm-oil trade lucrative to British merchants, while enabling them to give to the native African producer such a quantity of commodities in exchange for it as were an adequate incentive to the moderate exertion which the production of palm oil required. By this means the Africans have enlarged the sphere of their wants and necessities. They have become accustomed to the use of articles with which they would not now willingly dispense.\n\nBut during the creation of this stimulus changes have been gradually progressing elsewhere, which powerfully affect the conditions of that comparatively easy commerce. One, and a most important one of these changes, has been the opening of those great treasure-houses of nature, the mineral oil wells of the United States and Canada. The trade which this has originated is only in its infancy; yet it has greatly affected the value of that article which governs the price of palm oil in our market. Tallow has fallen gradually from 50s. per cwt. to 45s. per cwt. The ratio of supply systematically outstrips that of demand. The estimates for the present year made by authorities in the trade are to the effect that there will be a constantly-progressing\n\nPage 80\n\nAccumulation of stock in hand. And although the price now asked for delivery six months hence is 45s., there seems little reason to doubt that before the end of 1863 Russian tallow will not fetch above 40s. in England.\n\nUnder the influence of this change, palm oil has receded from 44l. per ton, until it is now with difficulty saleable at 37l. per ton; and if Russian tallow continues to fall, as we expect, palm oil must come down to 32l. or 33l. per ton. As the expense of conducting the trade will be the same as before to the British merchant, it is quite clear that the value of European goods given by him to the Africans for the oil must be at least one-third less than hitherto. The Africans can therefore only receive in future two-thirds of what they have hitherto received for their palm oil. But this loss is further aggravated by the increased value here in England of the articles principally given them in exchange—viz., cotton goods. Those made for the African market are heavy, and contain a great deal of cotton; their price has therefore, enormously advanced, so that the two-thirds of former value will be represented by about one-third the former quantity of cotton goods. It will be only on such terms that the merchant will be able to buy palm oil with any hope of profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Palm Oil and Cotton', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Many important changes have been wrought in the world by the fluctuations of trade. And in proportion as the general exchange of productions progresses among the nations under the influence of free trade, such changes will undoubtedly become more frequent. That they are instruments in the world's advancement, is undeniable. We alluded last month to the impulse given to the search for available fibre, consequent upon the failure of the cotton supply from America, and of the influence fibre might exercise in the great work of African industrial regeneration. It is scarcely necessary to say here that we believe in that regeneration. And feeble as the evidences of its approach may seem to the world at large, we think we see in them a strength that nothing can long impede or overcome. Yes, Africa must emerge from her Pagan superstition, her wars and atrocities, her industrial apathy and inertia. Looking at her in relation with the rest of the world some ten years since, the prospect was gloomy enough; the day of her emerging seemed indefinitely postponed. This was only because we could not see what was in the womb of time. Those ten years, a brief space in the world's history, have been mighty in the agencies which they have organised for African advancement. The inscrutable mind and Almighty hand of Divine Providence have been at work among the nations for the good of Africa! And we shrink into self-acknowledged nothingness as we think of how little we comprehended the signs of the times, and the extent of influence which discoveries and events were preparing for mankind.\n\nThe great substitute for the slave-trade on the West Coast of Africa, south of the River Gambia, has been the trade in palm oil. Palm oil has become the great staple of Western Africa. Taking into account the difficulty of access to the interior, and the manners and habits of the people, it must be admitted that the trade in this useful article has had an extraordinary development. Palm oil was precisely such an article as the barbarous inhabitants of a tropical climate needed to possess in the infancy of their commerce. The tree which produces the palm-oil nut is the most valuable of all trees to the native African. It grows spontaneously over large tracts of country. It furnishes him with oil, wine, vinegar, thatch, fibre, and fuel. Accustomed themselves to the free use of palm oil, the Africans had only to prepare a larger quantity from fruit ready to their hands, for which they had neither to till or sow."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Produce Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'PALM OIL.—Early in the week a good business was done, since when, however, the demand has fallen off, and at the close the market is quiet, with only a limited inquiry.

As a matter of fact, in some cases advances were made despite discouraging official policies and practices. Even the Gold Coast cocoa industry, of which the British were greatly proud, was essentially developed with local initiative.

Yet until this time the industry had benefited little from scientific research carried out in the country. As the West African Com› mission observed: It is ... extraordinary that until 1937 there was no single agricultural station in the cocoa belt proper at which research could be carried out on the requirements of the crop.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting.

Either minerals had been known and worked long before the colonial era, or deposits were found by men who were specifically searching for minerals. Before the colonial era both Southern Rhodesia and the Gold Coast, where the local population had mined and worked gold for generations, were noted for their potential mineral wealth rather than their agricultural prospects. In Nigeria, too, the local population had mined and worked tin for generations before the white men penetrated the interior. Thus in a number of cases prospecting during the colonial period started with locating areas where mining had been carried out by the local population. Expectations of growing rich overnight attracted many Europeans and much capital into Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, but a 'Second Rand' was not found, only small deposits being located.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

In September 1931 the Colonial Office dispatched a circular to officers administering depen› dencies asking them to help Britain and reminding them that: the interests of the United Kingdom and those of the Colonies and Dependencies are inseparably bound up with one another, that the perils which face the United Kingdom are perils which menace the whole Empire ... that any general collapse of British credit and declir - in the exchange value of sterling must spell ruin for the colonies no less than for the United Kingdom. 83 Despite the higher tariff on non-British goods, their importation, to the advantage of consumers in the dependencies, increased greatly.

Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

He was disappointed that he was not able to announce that they had obtained a Stock Exchange quotation. The Company's papers were before the committee, and they had complied with all the requirements of the Stock Exchange; but the committee had informed them that so many companies had started this year that they must wait their turn. He, therefore, thought it was only a question of a few weeks as to when they would get their quotation. He assured the shareholders that the shares were worth 10s., and if next year he did not see them at £1, he should be disappointed. At one time he was in favour of reducing the shares, but the shareholders did not agree with him, and he must confess he thought they were right, for he did not now see the necessity of it. They were going on as well as they possibly could. London was the base of the Company's operations, and they were a long way from the mine, and would always be at a disadvantage until the telegraph system was improved. The Governor of the Gold Coast had been to see the mine, and the Board were awaiting a report from him. He was now in England. The Board would endeavour to obtain an interview with him, and urge upon him and the Ministry the right of the Gold Coast to some little share of the public money which was saved and remitted home to England.

The influx of Mohammedans into the Gold Coast has been very noticeable in recent years. In Accra alone, irrespective of the Hausa constabulary, there are probably not less than 1,000 followers of Islam.\n\n**Education.**—The educational system is based upon an ordinance passed in 1887 for ""the promotion and assistance of education in the Gold Coast Colony"" and upon rules framed by a Board of Education.\n\nAlthough there are two well filled Government schools, one at Accra and the other at Cape Coast, the work of educating the natives is practically in the hands of the Wesleyan and the Basel missionary societies. In 1892 the former had 26 schools with 2,948 children on the registers, and the latter 32 schools with 2,192 children. The Roman Catholics now have nine schools with 1,189 children on the registers. The total number of children under instruction in the Colony during the last five years has been as follows: 1888, 4,585; 1889, 5,038; 1890, 5,356; 1891, 6,688; 1892, 7,572.\n\nAlthough these figures show advance, the result is very meagre having regard to the population. As a matter of fact only five per 1,000 of the population are now attending the elementary schools, and there remains therefore an enormous amount of work to be accomplished.\n\n**Imports and Exports.**—Of the total imports about two-thirds come from the United Kingdom, the remainder being supplied by the United States, Germany, France, and Holland. The total value of the imports during the last six years is shown as follows: 1887, £363,715; 1888, £432,112; 1889, £440,868; 1890, £562,102; 1891, £665,781; 1892, £597,094.\n\nThe value of the exports during the last six years is shown as follows: 1887, £372,446; 1888, £381,619; 1889, £415,926; 1890, £601,348; 1891, £684,304; 1892, £665,064.\n\nBy far the larger quantity of the exports go to the United Kingdom; next in order are Germany, France, and the United States. A large trade in the timber of the Colony is springing up. The export of timber has increased from 240 feet, valued at £4 in 1887, to 2,130,614 feet, valued at £36,407 6s. in 1892. The transport of the timber from the timber grants to the coast is at present the principal obstacle to the success of the trade.\n\nOne of the most remarkable exports is that of monkey skins.

The colony he was going to govern was the oldest British Colony on the West Coast of Africa, but it had not made that progress which it should have made considering the time they had had it. It was now about 300 years since the first occupation of the Gold Coast took place, but the Government had neglected the opportunities afforded for its advancement and development. However, largely on account of the action of the merchants in Liverpool and Manchester, and of England generally, a great deal more had been done in the last ten years to call attention to the importance of these colonies. They were now making better progress than ever before, and they relied upon his Excellency to see that this greater progress was continued. In the Colony he was going to administer there had been an excess of taxation over expenditure by some £200,000, which was lying in London unused. They urged that it was the duty of the Government to use it productively. Any excess in receipts should be used to make taxation more equal. He hoped that the new Governor would give his attention to this matter on his arrival on the coast. Another matter was the supply of water to the coast towns; and then there was the question of the railways. For years they had urged upon the Government the necessity for the construction of railways to the hinterland of the Gold Coast. They did not want to hurry the Government on this question, but if there was any progress to be made in this direction it was necessary something should be done to put them on an equality with other countries. It had been said that the first thing was to construct a harbour, for it would be impossible for the Government to land the material necessary for the construction of a railway unless there was a harbour where the goods could be landed. Latterly they had before them the proposed ordinance dealing with Crown concessions of land for mining or other purposes. He thought it was the first duty of the Government to see that such grants were utilised. The Section had sometimes complained or criticised some action, and he begged the Governor to believe any criticism of theirs upon any Governor or Government on the coast was done with the desire to co-operate with that Government or Governor to advance the welfare of the country in which they had all such interest. It was a great position his Excellency was going to fill. Governor Maxwell would have 2,000,000 human beings to care for, and he had the power to make or mar their happiness. It was a position of great responsibility, and it was one, in nine cases out of ten, filled with dignity and honour, and with a full regard for the welfare and the rights of the native population. At present Governor Maxwell was before them as an untried man as far as the West Coast was concerned, but his previous experiences would be of the greatest use to him amongst the natives of the West Coast. He might depend upon their support in everything calculated to advance the interests of the country which he was going to administer. He could only hope that Governor Maxwell would have good health to carry on the government successfully. They had every good wish for his future success.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Mr. Hutton on West African Affairs', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Gold Coast settlements have belonged to England for 120 years, and until 1843 the government was satisfactorily administered by a company of merchants, and was then taken over by the Crown. The British jurisdiction extends over a territory of about 6,000 square inches, and a population computed at about 275,000 natives. The trade of the Gold Coast has doubled during the last ten years. In 1871, the imports, according to the Gold Coast Customs returns, amounted to 250,000l., and the exports to 378,000l.; but according to the British Customs Blue Book, the exports from this country alone amounted to 477,000l. The annual revenue which, until 1867, amounted to about 10,000l., reached 30,000l. in 1870. There are at present an Administrator receiving 1,500l. per annum, and about fifty civil officers whose salaries, amounting to 8,500l., are paid out of the taxes.\n\nThe merchants on the Gold Coast ask for similar protection to their trade to that on the Gambia, and that competent officers should be sent out to frame and administer the laws. They complain bitterly of the ordinances passed by the Council in which only one of their members has a voice. The bankruptcy laws favour the dishonest native trader, who evades his creditors by going into the bush. The Customs ordinances are most grievous—they have been framed by men who know nothing whatever of the trade.

He also agreed that concessions of land should not be granted unless the land was utilised. So far as gold mining was concerned, the operations had not given a return on the capital invested. The construction of light railways would tend to develop the resources of the country. He thought the Ashanti territory should be placed under British protectorate, as would be for the benefit of the people themselves.

B. Griffith, the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, to Lord Knutsford will show how it comes that that coast has got its name. It has been known for centuries that gold existed in the rivers and the soil of the region immediately behind the coast, and in their own primitive way the natives have probably worked it from time immemorial. Moreover, at various times English companies have been floated for the purpose of mining the precious metal. Machinery has been sent out, and white men have been sent out to superintend it. But either the machinery never got out of the bush, where some of it may still be seen, or the works had to be abandoned from bad management or from the death of the white men who superintend them. Sir W. B. Griffith, in the report just issued, gives a melancholy list of the companies that have been started, got up capital, and come to grief in their efforts to utilise the gold of the Gold Coast. Happily the Governor has a more hopeful story to tell. His report is really the narrative of a journey he made up the Ancobra river in the early part of the present year, and of the various mines he visited which are being successfully carried out under white superintendence. He tells what he saw at the Akankoo, the Gie Appantoo, the Prestea, and other mines, where shafts have been sunk to considerable depths to get at the quartz, where machinery has been erected, stamps fitted up, Europeans are carrying on their work successfully, and hundreds of natives are employed. So far the yield of gold per ton has been moderate, but quite sufficient to give a fair profit on the outlay. The surface has as yet only been scratched, and further careful exploration, especially in the interior, might yield profitable results. Sir W. B. Griffith sums up the position succinctly and clearly. He is convinced that the country is rich in gold, and that it is merely a matter of the necessary time and scientific application for that gold to pay well for extraction. Earnest and well-considered attempts, he states, are now being made to secure success. The country once opened up and cultivated would yield rich returns to capital invested in the economic agriculture of any kind of tropical produce. But unfortunately—and this is the fatally weak point—the natives of the country cannot be relied upon to supply the necessary labour, which must come either from the Kroo country or from China. Chinese it would be a pity to introduce here. The Krooman are well known as the great workers of West Africa, and surely it need not be difficult to obtain a supply of them. At the same time, by patient and intelligent effort, the natives themselves might receive a stimulus to labour when once they saw it would be to their advantage. We believe that in this respect Governor Moloney has met with some success in Lagos. As to the suitability of the region for the residence of white men, we now know so well the conditions under which health can be maintained in the tropics that no man with a sound constitution to start with need come to grief if he give himself fair play.

The total trade amounted to £1,809,340, of which exports absorbed £877,803. In the last six years the trade has increased upwards of 55 per cent. The chief imports are piece goods, hardware, food-stuffs, and alcohol, while the exports are palm oil and kernels, rubber, gold dust, &c. The Customs revenue is largely derived from spirits, and the Acting-Governor takes occasion to mention that the reputation of trade gin as specially deleterious is undeserved. From an analysis, which he gives, it appears that West African trade gin is not more or less deleterious than the gin sold all over London. The export of palm products amounted to about £225,000, and that of rubber to about £330,000. In the last six years about a million monkeys have been slaughtered on the Gold Coast for the sake of their skins; but this trade is decreasing, because the traders have to go further into the interior to find the monkeys they require. Last year over 90,000 skins, worth over £14,000, were exported.\n\nThe land in the Colony is not generally sufficiently cultivated, though the soil is rich and will produce almost any commodity.

The gold which is generally obtained on the Gold Coast is merely that which is found in the beds of the rivers which the torrents have washed out from the soil of the interior plateaux and mountain ranges, and I am convinced that the great gold-finds of the future will be made in the districts of the interior between the Gold Coast and the Niger, where we have a great deal of evidence both of natives and Europeans to indicate that the rocks are full of gold deposits.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Present Depression in all Branches of African Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'During the last twenty-five years England has acquired the sovereignty over portions of the Gold Coast which did not before belong to her, and Lagos has come into existence as a flourishing port, owing to the opening up of the Niger trade. With the benefits of British rule trade should have improved in this section of the West Coast, but with the exception of the growth of Lagos, which has been due to the opening up of the trade of the Niger, we fail to see any real improvement in the whole of the colony. The colony is dependent on customs dues for its revenue, and to pay the cost of administration, it is necessary that imports should be taxed. Foreign nations have trumped up claims to trading stations, to which a few years ago they attached no importance, and established ports close to our territories, even at times dividing one portion of the colony from another, whereby difficulties are thrown in the way of the British merchant, and his rival is enabled to land goods duty free, which, by a system of smuggling, compete with those which have to pay the dues of the British colony. The increased means of communication incident on the introduction of steam have largely increased the competition and enabled a fresh class of trader to enter into the business, so that profits have been cut down still more. The want of means of small native traders, and the laxity with which inexperienced merchants give credit, have led to many bad debts, which seriously affects trade. The English merchant without regular correspondents on the coast, and who supplies goods to those who write to ask for credit, should remember that many a man without any more capital than an envelope and a sheet of paper can write a business letter. A favourite ""dodge"" of these adventurers is to write for quantities of samples of all sorts and kinds, from a needle to a sewing-machine, from a biscuit to cases of wine or spirits, and thus gradually establish themselves as traders.

Even so. And this does not rest upon our testimony alone; it is no discovery of ours. We do but bring forward well-known facts. Year after year, until the years count by centuries, the driblets we write of have been coming into Europe. At one time they furnished its chief supply. History says they amounted some 150 years ago to 3,500,000l. sterling a-year.* Now, in 1863, the total to Europe and America does not probably exceed 700,000l., or 800,000l. The decrease is not the result of exhaustion of metal, but of exhaustion of labourers. The population even 150 years ago was at least five times greater than it is now. Slave wars and the foreign slave-trade caused that exhaustion; as they had already, even at that remote period, reduced the inhabitants one half. At a moderate computation, it seems certain that since the Portuguese first began to import the precious metal from the Gold Coast, above 400 years ago, those lands lying between the sea and the Kong Mountains have furnished from 800 millions to 1,000 millions of pounds sterling of gold to the civilised world. And yet enlightened statesmen of the nineteenth century, because, through gross mismanagement, the Gold Coast costs for government and a shadow of defence some 20,000l. a-year more than has hitherto been raised by imposts, set their faces like flints against every proposition to make and maintain even one good road for vehicles from the Coast to the Ashantee frontier. Why, chiefly? Because they are only Protected Territories. As if Great Britain could ever abandon them; could leave them a prey to Ashantee on the one side, and slavetraders and piratical adventurers, or European rivals, on the other. She cannot leave them; let her, therefore, utilise them; let her benefit herself and them by that which they can yield. We know well that if self-interest will not induce us to make a colony of the Gold Coast, we were idle to appeal to any other feeling. If not, we should say some compunction ought to be felt with regard to territories that have literally lost through us and other European nations 800 millions sterling of treasure, and millions of their population. Lost; for what have they to show? What remains to them for that which they have thus parted with? Why countries thus endowed with wealth, and thus surrendering wealth, ought to have had at least roads, bridges, and cities to boast of. They have not one. But it is not too late. They will have them, and Great Britain must build them. They can pay her largely for them. Every fifty miles of roads and bridges, introducing and securing order, stability, progress, and enlightenment, will open a new mine of wealth. We claim for those territories, as a right, that they should be made a colony of the British Crown. Their future depends on this. They have no inherent power of self-regeneration. They are too deep in the filth of polygamy, slavery, and Devil worship to work out their own release. If they possess any arts, they are of the rudest and most primitive kind. They have neither art nor science of their own to aid them; nothing that will enable them, of themselves, to make a road, a bridge, a harbour, a breakwater, a secure roadstead—any one, in fact, of all those things that are indispensable for development and prosperity, for wealth and civilization. We claim for them, therefore, the right to be made a colony. We shall show in future articles that this may be done, not only without injustice to any, but with manifest and immense advantage to all. And we are convinced that if our public men could be brought so to give their attention to this question of making the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast a British colony as to arrive at a comprehension of the enormous national advantages that are to be obtained by so doing, the anomalous compromising character of our present relations with those territories would be put an end to by the yielding of Her Majesty's Government to an intelligent pressure for the immediate admission of those territories into the list of the colonial possessions of Great Britain."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD FIELDS OF WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M.

Mr. Thomas Cornish visited the Gold Coast as mining expert with Commander Cameron, and spoke well of the prospects. It is commonly thought that the richest deposits have not yet been found, and the districts we are already acquainted with, we do not know in depth. What the depth of the gold-bearing strata is no one seems to have ventured to say. The gravel beds which form the valley of the Tacquah have not been worked to any depth, and as the weight of gold is seven times greater than gravel we should naturally expect to find the richer deposits in depth, in the same way as in the well known hydraulic mines of Western America. The great drawback is the climate, which is generally admitted to be bad, although Europeans have been known to live on the coast for 20 and 30 years. Europeans often in countries like the Gold Coast indulge in excesses which undermine their health, although I cannot for one moment think that all those who have returned with broken health come under this category. Fevers, we know, prevail, and exposure to night dews is courting death. We are interested in\n\nother countries which have the reputation of unhealthiness, such as some parts of South America and India. No doubt by the exercise of the greatest precautions much sickness might be avoided, but we have still the fact that it is dangerous, and that the excessive heat is enervating.

Up till 1876 Cape Coast Castle enjoyed that honour, but in that year the head-quarters of the Government were moved to this place. The change would have been inadvisable on other than sanitary grounds, as there is not the least protection here against the surf which breaks along the shore, at some seasons rendering landing impracticable, and at all times dangerous. Once ashore, Accra presents pleasanter features and surroundings than are to be found in any of the other towns of the Gold Coast Colony. The town is much more scattered than that of Cape Coast Castle. It is built on the top of a red cliff, some 60 feet high, overlooking the sea. Formerly there were three Accras, British and Dutch, adjoining each other, which now form one town, and Danish two miles east. The latter still retains its Danish appellation, Christiansborg. British Accra is the oldest English possession on the West Coast, having been owned by us for upwards of two hundred years. The Danes do not seem to have left their mark on the place to any extent, either as regards language, manners, or customs, whereas the Dutch have left traces of their rule here in the number of half-castes with Dutch names, and also in the language spoken by the natives. Fantee is, of course, the language spoken by the natives, but it is a good deal corrupted by the addition of English and Dutch words. The language, to the ear unaccustomed to it, sounds uncouth and unmusical, and utterly devoid of that rhythm which Oriental languages possess, and which is so attractive to the untutored ear. The people here appear to be a similar race to the Ashantees. In fact, there is such constant intercourse going on between the Ashantee country and Accra that a large number of the inhabitants of this place are Ashantees. There are no troops here, merely a large force of Houssas, but their services are not much in request, as the people are very law-abiding. There is a considerable trade between Accra and the interior, and a large amount of gold dust is brought down and exported to England. The greatest care is requisite in purchasing this, and European merchants find it necessary to employ native assayers to prevent fraud on the part of the sellers. Some of the native jewellers here turn out fairly good workmanship in the shape of rings, necklaces, bracelets, &c.; they always manufacture from 22-carat gold, and their workmanship is consequently extremely soft. There are very few European merchants here—not more than three or four at present. Their number seems to have been diminishing of late years, and appears to be likely still further to decrease. The firms at home find that they can get their business out here equally well transacted by educated natives at less cost, so that the latter are gradually absorbing all the agencies for English houses. The white man cannot compete with the negro in his own country, when the latter is of average intelligence, fairly educated, and sufficiently cute; and from the progress made by the upper class of natives, it appears that the large firms in England will in a few years' time be glad to act as agents for the native merchants, instead of the latter transacting that office for them. A plentiful and constant supply of labour is the great difficulty this colony has to contend with—not that there is any lack of materials at hand, but the negro will not work as long as he can exist without it, and in a climate like this, existence becomes practicable on a very small amount of labour. The consequence is, that the adult male population of the Gold Coast Colony add little to the riches or produce of the country. Most of the work that is done is performed by the female portion of the community, while their husbands sit at ease and complacently view their wives and daughters labouring while they eat the bread of idleness. All the Europeans are agreed that the only hope for the future is a system of forced labour which, compelling able-bodied natives to work for fair remuneration, will take steps to guard this measure against the risk of abuse. In a very short period the increased wealth of the colony would demonstrate the benefits of such a measure, whilst the increased improvement in the condition of the natives would lead them to see that forced labour was advantageous to them and to the colony."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

The settlements, I know, first came under the notice of the Imperial Government as the market for the slave-trade. They were ceded to the Crown after the slave-trade had received its deathblow; but even then the taint of the trade was to be discerned in the traditions and policy of the local authorities—in the improvidence, dishonesty, and gambling propensities of the traders—in the exaggerated manifestation of native vices. The result of these facts was that the settlements were unproductive for years so far as exports were concerned. Has this unproductiveness mended as it ought to have mended under the Government? No. Even after a profitable market has been formed for the produce of the settle-\n*October 23, 1868.*\n\n---\n\nuenth, the produce shipped thence is incomparably less in quantity and inferior in quality than the produce shipped from parts of the sea-line not under our flag.

This precise trade, representing 147,600l per annum flowing into Bristol alone, is carried on in about twenty vessels, which take out from the port of Bristol British manufactures and foreign and colonial products.

The air is so damp that it is impossible to make clearings by burning the undergrowth, while the trees are so close, and the natives are by nature so indolent, that nothing in the way of pioneer work can be expected from native enterprise. So long as they have enough to eat, the coast and forest tribes will do nothing unless forced by the more vigorous white man. Doubtless, gold exists in abundance in this forest land, but speculators must remember that it is a very different matter prospecting for gold here as compared with the open, healthy veldt of South Africa and the thinly wooded plains of West Australia. No European could do manual labour on the West Coast and live, and even as overseers the death rate would be very high, for it is well known that where ground in the forest is disturbed, the malaria arising from it increases in deadliness. Therefore the Gold Coast cannot, under present conditions, be considered a promising region for the investor in gold or any other mines. For the same reason we must be prepared to lose some valuable lives before the projected railway is completed.\n\nIt is often remarked with astonishment, that though the British have been in possession of the Gold Coast for over two hundred years, yet our trade there has made little real progress, in striking contrast to what our race has accomplished in other parts of the world. The causes are not far to seek. The coast Natives have neither the energy nor the aptitude for trade of the Natives of India, and the only possible means of transport is the Native carrier. The country for many miles from the coast is unfitted for a white man. Hemmed in by a broad fever-laden mass of almost impenetrable forest, inhabited by more or less hostile tribes, it is little surprising that our trading stations have never left the coast line. After a short period of office, Government officials are removed to more salubrious climes, should they be lucky enough to retain their health; civilians, if they do not die, return home periodically to recruit their fever-stricken frames. Thus there is a constant stream of new officials and traders\' agents, who, before they can master the conditions of the country and carry out steps to improve the trade, are succeeded by others, and there is no continuity of policy. The only remedy for this state of affairs—and it is an expensive one—seems to be for every official and trading agent to have an ""understudy,"" ready to carry on the work without interruption when his principal leaves or is incapacitated.

It has been determined that it shall be removed from Cape Coast Castle to Christiansborg Castle, Accra. The fine old Danish slave-trade fort is now to become really the head-quarters of British power and authority in the newly-constituted Colony. We write with confidence, because it is not merely a rumour of change that reaches us, but because the authorities have commenced the work of removal. Material and stores were already in course of transport by sea from the one fort to the other, and everything indicated that the decision arrived at would be immediately carried into execution. When it was announced that there should be a Gold Coast Colony, we set forth the rival claims of Elmina and Accra. We were confident that one or other of these places would be selected. Elmina, in one respect, offered very great advantages, as the only possible future good and safe port on that coast; but the adjacent swamps, the drainage and removal of which would not only involve considerable expense, but would take much time to effect, did undoubtedly constitute a reasonable objection; while, at the same time, it did not appear to be at all a matter of necessity that the seat of Government should be at the great shipping port of the Colony. With the appliances of modern science, Elmina will be only one or two minutes distant from Accra. A decision of the Governor at the latter could be known almost instantaneously at the former by telegraph. The only objection that could be reasonably urged as regards Accra was, and is, that for some years past there has been considerable disturbance there by earthquake; and that, as shocks were still of frequent occurrence, it might happen that all the money expended on the erection of suitable Government offices would be thrown away. This has no doubt been taken fully into consideration, and the incontestably superior sanitary conditions at Accra have obtained for it a victory which we are not at all disposed to find fault with. But for the former presence of the Dutch at Elmina, with their intimate relations with the old enemy Ashanti, which seemed to render an immediate proximity of the British authorities indispensable, we have very little doubt that the decision now arrived at would long since have been formed and carried out. The Gold Coast Colony, if it is to become a credit to Great Britain, will need an effective Government; and to give it this, the seat of that Government, which must necessarily consist for the most part of Europeans, must be at a place which offers reasonable grounds for belief that they may be able to live there. Accra has always been regarded as the most salubrious of all the sea-coast towns, notwithstanding the filth which has there, as everywhere else, been suffered to pollute the atmosphere. Under proper regulations—such as will, we hope and believe, be in future enforced—Accra may become about as healthy a place to live in as can be found anywhere within the Tropics. It has also this very superior advantage, that within thirty or forty miles there is a hill country, in which the formation of a sanatorium for the Gold Coast has often been strongly advocated. This will now, of course, be availed of. Residences for the Governor and chief officials will be provided at or near Akrapong or Aburi, which will constitute one or other of those places the little Simla of the Gold Coast Colony. What Simla has been to Calcutta, such will Aburi or Akrapong become to Accra, so that men of talent and official distinction will not have any grounds for refusing appointments there. This augurs well for the future. It will be a grand thing for this part of Africa when a British Secretary of State shall no longer have it in his power to excuse, if not justify, the sending out from England of officials from whom no good could be expected, on the ground that no one who really merited confidence could be prevailed upon to go there. As the old penury of the local Government has disappeared, so will the excuse of a deadly climate disappear; and we should not be surprised if, under such changed conditions, appointments to the Gold Coast should be ere long at a premium in the official market, instead of at so lamentable a discount, as heretofore. We rejoice, therefore, on this ground, as on many others that we shall subsequently notice, that Christiansborg Castle, with Aburi or Akrapong, is henceforth to be the seat of British Government on the Gold Coast. The future extensions of British empire in that quarter of the world will necessarily be rather northward and eastward than toward the west; and the old Danish possessions will yet prove to have been anything but a dear acquisition at the small price we paid for them. They extend practically, on the sea-coast, to the Dahoman territory; and the civilizing influence of British institutions and rule must sooner or later work in that direction, as well as through Ashanti to the Kong Mountains. The comparative proximity of Accra to the River Volta is another and not unimportant consideration that influences our approval of the removal of the seat of Government to that place. The Volta is really the only navigable river of the Gold Coast Colony by which produce from the interior may be brought to the sea-coast. It traverses countries of great producing power, and we have always regarded it as destined some day to be the channel of a large and lucrative commerce. Even before the period of poor Lieutenant Dolben's ascent, which we watched and recorded in our columns with the deepest interest, that river possessed for us an immense power of attraction. The Krepee cotton plantations—commenced and much developed during the civil war in the United States, which interfered with the cotton supply of Great Britain—gave promise of large expansion; and we naturally looked with a longing heart toward that river, as affording, under proper care, regulations, and superintendence, a cheap means of transit to the sea-coast. And although poor unfortunate Krepee, with its industrious people, has been terribly visited by the Ashanti scourge, to the overthrow of many reasonable hopes and expectations, still, now that it may be looked upon as delivered for ever from Ashanti raids, its former promises of contributions towards the world’s wants and wealth may be fulfilled. And what so likely to promote the measures that may lead to such fulfilment, as the establishment of the seat of Government at Accra? The important question of Volta navigation, and penetration to the interior by the route of its upper waters, must—it is inevitable—force itself on the attention of a Governor of talent and energy, located at Christiansborg Castle and Aburi. The palm oil countries alluded to in another article (on Gold Coast Roads) may be effectively served, and the development of their resources be adequately promoted by the formation of the road from the Volta to Accra. But there are districts and countries north and east of the Volta at Kporng, the natural resources of which may be said to be illimitable; and for these the establishment of safe navigation on the River Volta is the only hope. On the ground, therefore, of a more reasonable expectation that the important question of Volta navigation and commerce will receive more attention from a Governor at Accra than from one at Cape Coast or Elmina, we are glad that the seat of Government has been thus changed. The influence of British authority and institutions and laws in the trans-Volta sea-coast districts is also a matter deeply to be desired for the sake of those districts and their people, as well as for the influence which their improved condition, security, and happiness may exercise on the countries beyond; and for this reason also we approve of the decision that has been arrived at, as being more likely to lead to a strengthening of that influence."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1875#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

This was partly because Europeans preferred jurisdiction over areas with which they were already familiar, and partly because pre-colonial foreign trade orientation caused African communities to be more susceptible to colonial economic innovations, such as the cultivation of crops specifically for sale to Europeans. The slaving zones from Senegal to Sierra Leone, from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Nigeria and from the Congo river to Angola were the stretches of coast› line first encroached upon by the European colonizers. In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves. Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland. Indeed, they overestimated the amount of wealth which could be readily made if they penetrated to these sources.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""In discussing the growth of European interest in the area of West Africa under review, it is useful to distinguish between two phases: that of freedom of movement for the European powers involved up to 1861 when Lagos was annexed to the British Crown, and the succeeding era of international rivalry between France and Britain with Germany entering the competition in the 1880s. This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian.

Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century. Dike considered that Christianity turned the slaves into revolutionaries who created upheavals in these states; but recent research has discovered other social and political factors to explain the problems of the delta states in the nineteenth century. 7', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Trade with Europe had existed before, but the nineteenth century witnessed a massive increase in the scale of this trade with varying effects depending on the structure of Saharan regional economies. For example, the cotton goods industry of Morocco, which had trans-Atlas outlets, succumbed after i860 to the competition of Manchester cotton goods, while the woollen textile industry of southern Tunisia fared much better and continued to feed products into trans-Saharan networks.$^{18}$ On the fringe of the Sahara various groups involved themselves in exports of primary products.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts.

The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

We could not accept this as the worthless result of our labours. It became evident that some other means must be employed. There was but one—a commercial combination that, having other principal operations, would, on certain conditions, make what we wanted in the Niger an accessory. That combination was found in what is now the ""Company of African Merchants."" But their condition of action was necessarily the same as that previously imposed by those who would have made it a principal—viz., Government co-operation, by a subsidy for a limited period. The difference was, however, an essential one. Government aid was no longer required to enable a company to be formed, or to bolster up a company. Here was a powerful body, with an ample subscribed capital, who, though having a profitable field for its full employment elsewhere, were yet ready to treat with the Government on terms of equality for a work which it was everywhere believed the Government were anxious to have performed. They made their proposals to the Government for enabling the latter to achieve what had been long regarded as a great national object, and as indispensable to the spread of Christian civilization in Africa. They did not seek any exclusive advantages. So far from this, they have, we believe, consented to associate another company, the West Africa, with themselves in this noble work. They offered to carry up traders and their goods at fair rates. They offered to repay the Government advances out of profits, should there be profits out of which to repay them. They stated distinctly that if the Government could find any other person or persons to perform the same services for a specific period, such as would alone suffice to solve the problem as to whether the Niger could or could not be made the field of a self-supporting commerce, they were perfectly willing to leave the work in such persons\' hands, without in any way opposing or embarrassing them in their efforts. Would it have been believed that this should have given rise to a virulent and combined opposition on the part of others, not one of whom would come forward for the work, and very few of whom had anything whatever to do with the trade on the Coast within 500 or 1,000 miles of the embouchure of the Niger? And yet such has been the case. We mentioned last month that a deputation of the African trade had been received by Lord Palmerston. The object of that deputation was to oppose any Government grant for the Niger. Since then memorials have followed in the same track. If the Niger cannot be traded in in the same simple way in which trade is carried on with the Coast districts, or in rivers not requiring steam navigation, the Niger, forsooth, ought to be left unnavigated and untraded in. The principle established in the discontinuance of trading consuls has, as we have already stated, been contended for as applicable to this case of the Niger. But surely nothing can be more dissimilar. If the parties opposing the grant, for several of whom we have a personal esteem, had trading establishments up the river, or if they were offering guarantees to the Government that they were about to form and maintain such at their own risk and charge, the principle would apply. But without these it does not apply. Not one in twenty of the opponents could be even indirectly affected by it; and we can only see in the opposition the evidence of that hostility to progress in Africa which declares roads to be unnecessary, which deprecates the establishment of civilization in place of barbarian rule, and which does not hesitate on occasion formally to declare that Africa suits best as she is.'}, {'id': 5542, 'article_title': 'The Royal Niger Company: Its Position and Prospects', 'full_section_title': 'The Royal Niger Company: Its Position and Prospects', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1887#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_06_1887', 'content': ""\n\nOne cause of satisfaction may be found, and that is the proof these inquiries afford that it is impossible for any misdeeds to be perpetrated with impunity in any part of the world where British reputation is at stake. It is reassuring to know that watchful eyes are directed to the most remote corners of our dominions, and that nothing of a questionable nature can occur without being subjected to public criticism and brought under official notice. This is a safeguard against too arbitrary proceedings by corporations possessing such considerable powers as the North Borneo and the Royal Niger Companies. But while such watchfulness may be commended, it is undesirable that an ill-founded prejudice against the enterprising Company now in question should be created. All who desire to see new markets opened must wish well to a Company which has practically secured for British trade (by its own enterprise alone, and in open competition) one of the most thickly populated and promising regions of Western Africa. It was to an Englishman that the discovery of the river was due, and the Royal Niger Company may be spoken of as the direct representative of the traders who, forty years ago, endeavoured to open up the Niger basin to British civilization and commerce. After the death of M'Gregor Laird, the actual pioneer of British trade on the Niger, the ground was occupied by the West Africa Company and other firms. The amalgamation of these into one large private Company in 1879 followed, and in 1882 this Company was further developed as a public joint-stock association under the title of the National African Company, with Lord Aberdare as its Chairman. Of the two large French Companies which were the chief competitors of the new organization, one was driven from the field and the other was bought up. Thus the present Company, having retained its position by the operation of the law of the survival of the fittest, and having grown by absorbing all its most persistent and energetic competitors, may be considered to have fairly earned the Royal Charter which was bestowed in July last. Its claim to respect, however, is not based merely on its proved supremacy as a trading organization. It has made 237 treaties with native tribes, and it is asserted that it has so established itself in the good-will of the natives that no single tribe has refused to join the confederation which it is forming for trading and administrative purposes. The limits of its influence are being constantly extended.

Something, doubtless, is due to the jealousy caused by the dominant position we occupy in the Niger; but even more may be attributed to the disappointed expectations of traders. Our Company first began its operations when trade was prosperous and the prices of produce high. During the last three years trade has been the reverse of prosperous, and the prices of nearly all the chief articles of African produce have fallen to less than half their former amount. Consequently, losses, and not profits, have been the result of these speculative expeditions into the Niger. And it is more convenient and agreeable to impute these losses to the evil genius of the Royal Niger Company than to the turn of trade and the course of events.\n\nGentlemen, I have already said that, unless we had taken a fairly hopeful view of the progress of the Company\'s affairs, we should not have been justified in proposing an ad interim dividend. I am unable, indeed, to announce any substantial increase—or, indeed, any increase at all—in the price of those articles which have hitherto constituted the bulk of our traffic. But the mass of that trade is steadily increasing, and we have been gradually able to establish a more just proportion between the cost of native produce and its price at home. More important still is the steady, although necessarily slow, progress in obtaining fresh articles of export. Here I may fairly say that our expectations have been exceeded. Many of these newer articles already contribute an appreciable addition to our receipts. We confidently look forward to their becoming every year of greater importance.\n\nI therefore now move: ""That the report and accounts now presented be received and adopted.""\n\nMr. James F. Hutton seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously.\n\nThe Governor then proposed, and Mr. John Edgar seconded, a resolution for an interim dividend, at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, for the half-year ended 30th June last, which was unanimously agreed to.\n\nThe Hon.

Organised originally under another name for the purpose of amalgamating British interests upon the Lower Niger, the first years of its corporate existence were devoted to the object of outstripping all foreign competitors for local influence, and especially to fighting with its own weapons an important French commercial enterprise organised under the auspices of M. Gambetta for the political purpose of establishing French rights in a region known to be one of the most valuable in Africa. Between the years 1881 and 1885 the Company almost ruined itself in defeating the efforts of France to gain possession of the basin of the Lower Niger. But although the struggle ran at moments so close, the result was entirely successful for British interests. The French houses withdrew from that portion of the river, and in consequence of what had been done Great Britain was enabled, at the Conference at Berlin in 1884, to take the position of the only Power having influence on the Lower Niger. The services of the Company were cordially recognised by the British Government of the day, and its position as a political instrument was greatly strengthened by the grant of a charter in 1886.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Royal Niger Company: Its Position and Prospects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""One cause of satisfaction may be found, and that is the proof these inquiries afford that it is impossible for any misdeeds to be perpetrated with impunity in any part of the world where British reputation is at stake. It is reassuring to know that watchful eyes are directed to the most remote corners of our dominions, and that nothing of a questionable nature can occur without being subjected to public criticism and brought under official notice. This is a safeguard against too arbitrary proceedings by corporations possessing such considerable powers as the North Borneo and the Royal Niger Companies. But while such watchfulness may be commended, it is undesirable that an ill-founded prejudice against the enterprising Company now in question should be created. All who desire to see new markets opened must wish well to a Company which has practically secured for British trade (by its own enterprise alone, and in open competition) one of the most thickly populated and promising regions of Western Africa. It was to an Englishman that the discovery of the river was due, and the Royal Niger Company may be spoken of as the direct representative of the traders who, forty years ago, endeavoured to open up the Niger basin to British civilization and commerce. After the death of M'Gregor Laird, the actual pioneer of British trade on the Niger, the ground was occupied by the West Africa Company and other firms. The amalgamation of these into one large private Company in 1879 followed, and in 1882 this Company was further developed as a public joint-stock association under the title of the National African Company, with Lord Aberdare as its Chairman. Of the two large French Companies which were the chief competitors of the new organization, one was driven from the field and the other was bought up. Thus the present Company, having retained its position by the operation of the law of the survival of the fittest, and having grown by absorbing all its most persistent and energetic competitors, may be considered to have fairly earned the Royal Charter which was bestowed in July last. Its claim to respect, however, is not based merely on its proved supremacy as a trading organization. It has made 237 treaties with native tribes, and it is asserted that it has so established itself in the good-will of the natives that no single tribe has refused to join the confederation which it is forming for trading and administrative purposes. The limits of its influence are being constantly extended. Already it has a station within 200 miles of the inland sea—Lake Chad—which is supposed to feed some of the western tributaries of the Nile, and it has made treaties with the great empires of Sokoto and Gando, which travellers have spoken of as offering practically unlimited opportunities for trade.

The contemplated directors of the latter had only come forward with a view of securing for Great Britain the riches of the Niger countries, and for those countries that agricultural and commercial development of their resources which promises to make them rich and civilized, and to bring great advantages to England.

The two banks of the Niger, the whole north bank of the Binué, and most of the south bank are also occupied by Mahomedans; and with one language, the Haussa, a man can get along throughout all this extensive region. The Europeans and the Western Soudanese are getting into better and better relations with each other. The former have greatly changed the character of the trade in this region, which used to be carried across country in large caravans. According to Herr Flegel, traders used to realize 500 and 600 per cent. on their transactions, and even now, in over-crowded markets, 100 per cent. is easily obtained. The transport of ivory by way of Kuka and Kano is almost entirely done away with. The monopoly of the United African Company, which lasted but a short time, ruined many single traders in ivory. Down to 1879 the caravan people, in returning with ivory, had presents pressed upon them by buyers to induce them to trade; after 1879 the caravaners had to solicit sale from the company and accept one-fifth the price they used to receive a few months before. But, fortunately, besides ivory, there are other native products capable of great development, and not at all likely to be exhausted—the various palm products, Shea butter, sesame, oil, cotton, skins, wax, potash, Kola nuts, potters\' ore, &c.\n\nHerr Flegel gives the following list of the principal Niger trading companies of the present time: 1. The United African Company (Limited), with about thirty factories, extending from the river mouth to Rabba (recently destroyed), on the Upper River, and including one on the Binué. The company has at present eight steamers and steam launches, and expects compensation for several vessels lately lost. 2. The Société Française d\'Afrique Equatoriale, founded by Count de Semellé, and bearing on its flags the motto, ""Sois brave et loyal."" It has, as far as known to Herr Flegel, eight factories—one at Brass, at the mouth of the Rio Bento, and the furthest up at Eggan. It has two steamers, two lighters, and a steam launch. 3. Crowther Brothers, sons of the Bishop, with one small steamer. 4. Mr. Scott, with one steam launch. 5. Mr. Lees, a native trader of Lagos, with an old steamer chartered. 6. Mr. Lander, in Brass, apparently connected with Mr. Lees. There are other firms in Brass, but their trade is restricted to the locality and to the palm oil brought to them by the Brass people for sale. 7. Mr. Phillips, navigating the Niger in a canoe till a steamer arrives. 8. M. Viard, formerly in the service of Count de Semellé. M. Viard has gone to France with a cargo of ivory, but factories are being built for him, and agents are busy in his interests.

Yet the development of the trade on the Niger during the past fifty years might teach us a salutary lesson with regard to the opening-up of the Congo. Unprotected by any European Powers, we believe, the trade on the Niger has been permitted to develop under the healthy stimulus of open competition, and now its banks are studded with trading stations of various nationalities, chiefly English, and its waters ploughed by numerous steamers and fleets of canoes. In a paper read at the Society of Arts [see African Times, May, p. 63] in April, by Mr. Robert Capper, who spent several years both on the Niger and the Congo, an interesting sketch of the growth of the Niger trade during the past fifty years, was given, from the first fatal attempt of M'Gregor Laird down to the present day. For the past five years an enterprising German explorer, Herr Robert Flegel, has been at work on the Niger on behalf of the German African Society. He has been able greatly to extend our knowledge of the river and its tributaries. He has discovered the sources of the great affluent, the Binué, which, with the main stream itself, forms the highway into the heart of the Soudan. Herr Flegel has an eye to the commercial interests of his country, and has sent home a report of great value, giving details as to the trade on this great river (which is as long as the Rhine from its mouth to Switzerland), and of the trading firms having stations on its banks. We have on several occasions drawn attention to the doings of the French on the Upper Niger; they have at last succeeded in extending their Senegambian domains to the banks of the river at Segu, a long way above Timbuctoo, and large sums have been voted for the construction of railways to the interior. Their object is to tap the Niger trade at its source; and the traders in the central and lower reaches of the river will doubtless make them welcome to all they may obtain in this way, even with all the advantages of their monopolizing treaties with the neighbouring chiefs. The Binué seems scarcely less important than the Niger itself, and, as Mr. Capper told the Society of Arts, there is a piece of British land at the confluence of the two rivers which carries with it the right of navigation."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.744, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE IN THE NIGER REGION', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Whatever may be the result of the Conference at Berlin, one important advantage will have been gained—viz., the opening of the eyes of Great Britain to the unassisted part that she has played during the past fifty years in the development of Central Africa north of the equator, and to her rights and duty to continue to act as the protector of the Lower Niger and Binue rivers, which, with their important tributaries, form one system which I will designate as the Niger-Binue. This term is in contradistinction to the Upper Niger, from Timbuctoo to the sources, which runs for a distance of 1,000 miles at the back of the French colony of Senegal, and which has been visited by several French exploring parties, though as yet no European trade has been opened there. Nor, indeed, can such trade be carried on profitably until the completion of the railway connecting the waterways of the Senegal and the Upper Niger. Between the latter and the Niger-Binue lies the long stretch of the Middle Niger, from Timbuctoo to Boussa; nature thus interposing a barrier of 800 miles between the Upper Niger basin, which will probably fall to France, and the Niger-Binue basin, which is already occupied by Great Britain. The Niger-Binue was unknown to Europe fifty-five years ago. The wildest theories were held as to the ultimate destination of the Niger—some geographers holding that it was absorbed by an inland sea, others that it fell into the Nile, others that it joined the Congo. The English traveller, John Lander, in 1831 solved the problem by starting from Badagry, and travelling northwards till he reached the Niger, near Boussa, where are the lowest rapids, and where commences the Niger-Binue system. He followed the river down 600 miles to the sea. Immediately on his return home, in 1832, his great discovery was turned to account by some Liverpool merchants, who despatched two steamers to nearly the highest navigable point on the Niger, and to Dagbo on the Binue. Numerous private expeditions from this country followed in the years 1834 to 1864, the most notable event being the formation in 1852 of the African Steamship Company, which established a line to Lokoga at the confluence of the Niger and Binue, 300 miles from the sea. Meanwhile the British Government had made efforts to open up both branches, and to lay down charts. Under an impulse given by Prince Consort, Parliament voted over £50,000 for the expedition of Her Majesty’s ships Albert, Wilberforce, and Soudan, during which the Government obtained the cession of a large tract of country about the confluence at Lokoga, where the British flag flies to this day. Another important expedition was that of 1854-5, during which were laid down most careful charts of the Binue for some hundreds of miles. In 1857 Parliament voted a five years' subsidy, averaging £7,000 a year, to Mr. Macgregor Laird, to assist him in developing trade in these rivers, and it was expressly stated on that occasion that immediate results could not be expected, but that posterity would reap the benefit. In a letter dated the 29th April, 1864, Earl Russell stated that he was willing to recommend a further subsidy of £6,000 for the same object. The proposal fell through—indeed, was rendered unnecessary by the springing up of British trade, which has lasted to the present day."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""THE ROYAL NIGER COMPANY'S TERRITORIES"", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""My Lord,—I am directed to say, that the letter addressed to this Chamber by the Foreign Office on the 2nd February last on the above-named subject has been reported upon by the committee of the African Trade Section, to whose consideration it had been referred. A very great interest has long been taken by this Chamber in the affairs of both the Niger and Oil Rivers districts, in which districts members of its African Trade Section have a large amount of capital at stake. When it became publicly known that a charter had been granted to the Royal Niger Company, the African Trade Section passed a resolution protesting against the charter on the ground that their large interests in the delta of the Niger, and their growing interest in the trade of the river itself, were likely to be seriously prejudiced by the powers bestowed upon the Company. It was felt as a grievance that this Chamber had not received any intimation of the intention of the Government to grant a trading company jurisdiction over countries discovered, redeemed from the export slave traffic, and generally brought under British influence by national efforts and expenditure, and wherein members of its African Trade Section had long traded, and were making efforts to extend their trade; that trade having, moreover, had a civilising influence upon the tribes of the delta. Your lordship will remember the very strenuous efforts made by this Chamber in the year 1890 to prevent the granting of a charter for the Oil Rivers district. The movement for such a charter doubtless arose, in part, out of the desire to preserve the commercial interests at the Oil Rivers from the complications and injuries resulting from the position and policy of the Royal Niger Company, but the granting of it would have secured to the applicants a monopoly of the trade of the Oil Rivers similar in character to that of the Niger trade already possessed by the Royal Niger Company. It has been the object of this Chamber to keep those countries of West Africa which have been acquired by national effort and expenditure open for all British traders, and it therefore rejoiced when the Government, acceding to its representations, resolved that the Oil Rivers districts should continue under direct Imperial control. The Chamber regrets to learn that her Majesty's Secretary of State, instead of limiting the administration of the Royal Niger Company to the main stream of the Niger, as the direct approach to the countries where its trade is situated, is about to sanction, or has sanctioned, the extension of the jurisdiction of the Company over one-fourth of the area of the Oil Rivers district, thereby consenting to the appropriation by the Company of districts which fed the trade of Benin and Brass, and to the separation of the Benin district from the Brass, Bonny, and Calabar districts. The description in the letter from the Foreign Office of the geographical features of the Wari district is applicable to the whole of the delta of the Niger, and whilst it is felt that, owing to the character of the delta, it will be impossible for the Company to exercise effective control over the waterways assigned to them, this Chamber views with great apprehension the attempts likely to be made to acquire a control, which will harass the merchants of the Oil Rivers and will probably lead to conflicts with the natives. The Chamber objects to the division of the Oil Rivers district for the following reasons, viz.: (1) That it is naturally one district; (2) that its waterways should not be under two separate and conflicting jurisdictions and fiscal systems; (3) that there should be no regulations in respect to its waterways calculated to obstruct free navigation of channels and creeks which are maintained by natural forces, and which, in the absence of the possibility of roads, are the highways of the district; (4) that the Wari districts were placed, by treaties, under the protection of the British Government prior to the making of any treaties by the Royal Niger Company, and that the British Consul recognised and enforced that condition by his action when the claims of the Company were first put forward; and the Chamber, moreover, in order to secure to the Oil Rivers Administration its proper sphere of development and its natural hinterground, respectfully submits that the Delta of the Niger should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and Consul-General for the Oil River Protectorate. It is urged that this step will inflict no injustice upon the Company. The National African Company Limited, when petitioning for a charter, represented that they had purchased the business of all European traders in the basin of the River Niger. They, however, neither compensated the smaller traders of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and this country, who were striving together with the larger firms to develop the Niger trade, who up to the date of the charter enjoyed free trade on the river, and who strongly protested against the loss of that privilege, nor did the Company buy up any portion of the much greater interests of the merchants of Oil Rivers (including Wari), who are again injured by the proposed extension of the charter over the districts between the Nun and the Forcados rivers, wherein Benin and Brass merchants have long carried on a trade created by their capital and enterprise. This Chamber does not mistake the terms of the charter, and is not under the impression that any traders are excluded from the Company's markets otherwise than by the obligation to pay the exorbitant license fees and duties imposed by the Company, and by the regulations enforced against their competitors in trade. Monopoly is prohibited and differential treatment is forbidden by Article 14 of the Company's charter, but so long as the Company are allowed to claim as their private property the land on both banks of the river and continue to be both a governing and trading body, they will legislate and execute for their own special advantage in trade. The almost total extinction of rival trade to that of the Company in the Niger Protectorate, where formerly there was so much competition, is a proof that the unfair influence and policy of the Company have secured them a monopoly. The fact that the details of the revenue and expenditure of the Company are kept from the public, and that there is therefore no proof that the Company exact the licenses from their own agents which they impose upon the agents of other traders, or that they debit themselves with the duties which they levy upon others, leaves them open to the charge of trading under a preferential system favourable to their own interests. It is recommended that the boundary of the Royal Niger Company's territories be altered so as to restore to the Oil Rivers district the Delta of the Niger as far as Onitcha, Asaba remaining in the possession of the Company, and Onitcha being included in the Oil Rivers Protectorate, and that the rights of the Company in respect to the navigation of the river be guarded in the spirit of the free navigation clauses of the Act of Berlin, to which the Foreign Office refers."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-05-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger and Chadda Company and the Company of African Merchants', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are authorised to state that the Niger and Chadda Company has retired in favour of the Company of African Merchants.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Gambetta, and the operations of both were so energetically conducted that the National African Company saw itself under the necessity either of entering into a commercial war or of retiring from the position. It determined upon adopting the former course, and was so far successful that at the Berlin Conference in 1884 to consider the whole West African position, the British representative was enabled to state that ""the whole trade of the Niger Basin is at the present moment exclusively in British hands."" This fact enabled Great Britain to take a different position from what she would otherwise have occupied in regard to that part of West Africa. A British Protectorate had been declared in July 1884, over the portion of the coast stretching from Lagos to the Rio del Rey and inland to the confluence of the Niger and the Binué. Great Britain took part at the Berlin Conference in the discussion of the clause by which the navigation of the Niger was rendered free to the merchant ships of all nations, and the British representative had a determining voice in the conditions under which free navigation was accorded. It should be pointed out that the existing rights of international navigation on the Niger extend only to merchant vessels; they do not include rights of free trade with countries bordering the river, and, while Great Britain allowed freedom of navigation on the portion of the Niger falling under her protection, a clause was inserted in the General Act setting forth that nothing in these obligations should hinder Great Britain from making rules of navigation not contrary to the spirit of the engagement nor should the benefits of free navigation be enjoyed by other nations except on condition of conforming to the rules so made.\n\nGermany had in 1884 declared a Protectorate of the Cameroons.

The result of five years of more or less constant struggle was that, in 1890, the Niger Company was able to show cause why the British sphere of influence should be extended to that lake. By an agreement the northern limit of the territories of the Niger Company was fixed at a line to be drawn from Barrua on the western shore of Lake Chad to Say, a town on the Upper Niger.

The interior, on the other hand, is healthy, and the trade can be carried on directly, without the intervention of native agency.

The great profits derived from trade during the dry season caused over-crowding and over-competition for a time, and brought the Niger trade to the verge of ruin. It was, however, revived by two Englishmen, who formed an amalgamated company, developed new branches of trade, and established a large number of new factories. The Binué was opened up to commerce, and vessels were built capable of plying on both rivers all the year round.

In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts of palm kernels becoming significant exports to Europe, Adansonia fibre's role in commerce with specific prices and quantities, and the trade of cloves from Zanzibar. They also highlight gum from Sierra Leone and the potential for increased trade in gum-copal from the Upper Congo, as well as the demand for kola nuts in Brazil, despite challenges in maintaining their condition.

With the few exceptions of the areas where European settlers owned much land, the agricultural export sector in the former British dependencies of tropical Africa was almost wholly in the hands of millions of unspecialized small producers. The family was the basic unit of production. It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2). The production of cloves in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), from where almost all British Empire requirements came, does not fit into this category. Clove plantations were worked by African labour but owned by Arabs.\nParticipation in the production of cash crops under the colonial situation did not give African producers any undue emotional shock. First, it did not involve any fundamental technological innovation.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio.

Here again, the nineteenth century is part of a continuous process, that of unequal trade relationships with the capitalist world. However, from the 1850s, great changes began to take place. Slaves gradually ceased to be Central Africa's principal 'export' to the outside world. Trade expanded in the main products obtained from a gathering-based economy: ivory, wax, copal, oil and coffee. The growth of this market economy is undeniable: the value of goods passing through Angolan ports increased sevenfold between 1844 and 1881; the cash turn› over of the Luanda branch of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino increased tenfold between 1865 and 1876. In the early 1870s, however, the value of exports derived from these products was still only twice that derived from the export of slaves in the 1820s. 14 The volume of these major African products reaching world markets was dependent on the way in which communications and trade networks functioned within the continent. These networks, with their staging posts, trade conventions and currencies, in turn defined the major economic zones on the nineteenth-century map of Central Africa, amounting to new 'frontiers' that overlaid and modified the former political and economic divisions of the region.\nThese new economic zones were dominated by the demands of the nerve centres of the nineteenth-century world economy. Each of them had its own historical traditions and political and social characteristics.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'African participation in the colonial economy, 1920-30', 'content': 'While it was still being forced on to some African communities, cashcrop farming was actively pursued by other Africans in the face of official indifference or hostility. They demanded the transport and marketing infra› structure, seizing the opportunity as soon as a railway line was completed. In many cases, they pioneered before the colonial governments had built bridges and feeder roads. Seed for new crops were taken from the colonial governments, from missionaries, from European farms and from Africans who were already engaged in cultivation. Cocoa and coffee are the two best known and most important of the cash crops whose extension relied mainly on African initiatives. Minor crops such as tea, tobacco and pyrethreum also bear out the same principle. Besides, Africans fought specifically for crops which were better money-earners than others. In the case of cocoa, this meant cultivating lands which were only marginally suitable. At other times, African preference precipitated a struggle against discriminatory colonial legislation. Thus, the latter part of the 1920s and the early 1930s saw a determined effort on the part of Africans in several highland areas of Tanganyika to cultivate Arabica coffee rather than hire their labour out or grow the less profitable Robusta variety. The Africans won literally by planting coffee trees faster than the colonial administration could destroy them. 10 Where peasant cultivation established itself as the hegemonic form of the colonial economy, it functioned like mines and plantations in drawing labour resources from an area much wider than the actual zone of production. Senegambian groundnut farming attracted seasonal labour from the hinterland of the Senegal and Niger rivers; cocoa in the Gold Coast and in the Ivory Coast drew upon Upper Volta; while Ugandan coffee-growers turned to Ruanda-Urundi and Tanganyika to expand output. Together, cash-crop farming and the wage labour of mines and agri› culture accounted for the overwhelming majority of Africans who partici› pated directly in the colonial economy. However, a host of other activities were generated or transformed by the new commodity relationships. It was rather late before the extensive forest reserves of the continent were seriously maximized, but an extractive timber industry arose early in Gabon and in varying degrees some such enterprise was pursued wherever forest reserves existed.

Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930.

In particular it seems that direct European involvement was counterproductive, as in the failed efforts at agricultural colonization in Waalo between 1819 and 1831,$^{21}$ and in the various efforts in Senegal, the southern Gold Coast, and Nigeria later on.$^{22}$ It was not that European personnel began to loom larger on the African scene; rather, the important change was that Europeans were largely displacing African merchants from The shift from the slave trade to palm oil strengthened the hand of private as against royal merchants (R. Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

In Kenya, for instance, Africans were forbidden to grow coffee, 'by far the most lucrative cash crop' in the country.$^{41}$ It was not until the 1950s that this European monopoly was shattered by Mau Mau.\nThe main result of all these steps was the proletarianization of the African peasantry, which appears to have taken place on a larger scale in Southern Rhodesia than in the other countries under discussion.$^{42}$ Thus African labour employed by Europeans at starvation wages produced cash crops for both the home market and for export. In Kenya, by 1927, between 83700 and 117 000 Africans, or more than 50% of total wage labour, worked in commercial agriculture. The leading crops were maize, coffee, wheat and sisal. Maize occupied only 325 ha in 1905; by 1920 it occupied nearly 12500 ha, and nine years later the area had risen to over 90000 ha.$^{43}$ By the early 1920s the settlers had ousted African peasants from the production and trade of this important staple. The area under coffee also recorded a dramatic expansion, rising from 32 ha in 1905, reaching over 11250 ha in 1920, and shooting up to nearly 39000 ha ten years later.$^{44}$ In 1913 coffee and maize exports earned the country £64991; in 1920 export of these two crops and sisal earned £566556 and their value reached £2429655 in 1930, with coffee accounting for more than 50%.$^{4S}$ These developments led to significant structural changes. In 1913, the exclusive African sector contributed 24% of the value of total domestic exports while the exclusive European sector contributed only 5%. Evidently by this time, African labour had made little impact on commercial agriculture. By 1932 the contribution of African areas had dropped to 9% while that of European areas had risen to 76%.$^{46}$ A dominant feature of the economy in colonial Kenya was established."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

The Portuguese, for example, exploited their role as suppliers of weapons to pressure the Chikunda bands to recognize Lisbon's limited authority over their territory.$^{62}$ Similarly, the Sena began to rely so heavily on their Arab allies that they jeopardized their sovereign status. 63 Even the powerful Bemba were not totally immune to pressures from Arab and Swahili traders. 64 Moreover, with the abolition of the slave trade, those classes or strata within them who profited from the trade - the aristocracy, merchants, warlords and landlords - searched desperately for new commodities such as wax, coffee, groundnuts, and vegetable oils which they could extract from their subordinates or acquire through commerce in order to ensure a constant supply of European consumer goods and weapons necessary to maintain their privileged position.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Production: models of sparse and dense populations', 'content': 'The chronology of these changes obviously cannot be traced in detail: depending on the region, they might have extended over more than two centuries (1600-1850).

Moreover in some cases American plants had become so integrated that they were no longer regarded as foreign imports. Thus in the Kongo region we have for the lower Zaire river the first systematic inventory of a Central African flora (Tuckey expedition, 1818), which confirms the widespread use of the American varieties. In the colonial period, a detailed inventory of Kongo agriculture noted that several American imports (groundnuts, sweet potatoes, etc.) were perceived in the oral culture as of local origin as were yams or voandzou.""$^{1}$ Elsewhere, however, proverbs and rites still serve as reminders that the foundation of African agriculture antedated the Amer› ican borrowings in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

The Lozi aristocracy and landlords also used slaves to dig canals and ditches in order to bring fertile marshy soil into cultivation. By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

One nineteenth-century traveller recalled the effect of the Yao raids in the 1860s against the Manganja: A number of the Manganja went with them. Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert.

The kernels of the palm fruit until quite recent years were regarded as little better than a waste product; they are now sent in enormous quantities to Europe for the purpose of having the oil expressed, the ordinary palm oil of commerce being made from the pulp which surrounds the kernel. Fifty years ago timber figured among the exports of Sierra Leone for £33,000; now it seems of no value at all. The value of palm oil exported fifty years ago was only £4,600; in 1882 it was ten times the value, though in 1883 and 1884 the value had greatly fallen, mainly owing to the marked decline in price. Rubber was of scarcely any importance fifty years ago; now it is exported to the value of about £90,000 annually, while in 1882 the value of the palm kernels exported was close on £100,000. In quantity, however, the palm oil exported from Sierra Leone does not seem to have increased greatly during the last thirty-five years. In 1850 it was 285,000 gallons, in 1856 463,000 gallons, in 1880 292,000 gallons, and 562,000 gallons in 1882.\n\nIt is on the Gold Coast and Lagos that we find palm oil and palm kernels the most flourishing exports. As will be seen from the objects shown in the Exhibition, there is plenty of gold within short distance of the Gold Coast, and about £50,000 worth of gold dust was exported in 1883. Still, although the Wassau Gold Mining Company has been at work for several years, its success has not been commensurate with the richness of the deposits. This seems due to the want of sufficient labour and adequate machinery. It is difficult to say how this labour question is to be solved; the natives themselves will only do the minimum of work, and the climate is unsuited for white labourers. Were it not for this difficulty, the many resources of these colonies could be raised immensely in value. Palm oil and palm kernels make up two-thirds of the total exports from the Gold Coast. The quantity of the oil exported in recent years has been about 2,500,000 gallons annually. From the four West African colonies the export of ivory does not much exceed £15,000 annually.

The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The data for Lagos are for 1862. Going back fifty years ago, to 1836, we find no definite statistics for the Gold Coast; while Gambia exported no less than in 1875—£147,000. The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony.

Among many other places, our steamer, the ""Kinsembo,"" touched at Duke Town, Old Calabar river. Duke Town and Creek Town, close by it, are situated about forty miles up the sea. Here I found that about 500 tons of palm oil were shipped every week, besides palm kernels, rubber, ebony, and other products of Africa. Now, Old Calabar is an exact reproduction of the Upper Congo in scenery and the character of its vegetation. From Bolobo to Stanley Falls, and up the Lunlungu, Ikelemba, Itimbiri, Lubilash, M\'bura, Arnrurimi, and M\'bungu rivers, the islands and mainland are covered with the oil-palm and rubber trees. Forests are draped with the orchilla weed; the gum-copal is so abundant that tons may be found among the boulders of the Cataract region, which have been washed down from the Upper Congo; the natives know where the largest deposits are to be found. This length of navigation, which has similar features to Old Calabar, is just twenty times the length of river that, in the Bight of Benin, contributes 500 tons of palm oil weekly. When developed to the same extent, this would furnish 10,000 tons weekly. We have also to reckon the ivory, no mean article of commerce, that could be collected from an area of 500,000 square miles, without risk; and also the ground-nuts, or their oil, which could be produced from the area of the Cataract region, where this plant is most in cultivation, besides valuable minerals. We have not reckoned the food products which could be exported within two years from the opening of the railway. In a comparatively brief time steamers departing daily from the mouth of the Congo could not convey the produce of the river and its immediate banks, provided always that the railways were adequate to transport the produce from the Pool. Without a railway it is lost time to dwell upon the products of that extensive region under consideration, as the whole of it is not worth a thought. Given a railway, and given that every enterprising soul is stimulated to carry on his business or industry on the banks of the river, assured that his communications are as easy as though settled at Sierra Leone, and that the Government which supervises him and his surroundings is generous and liberal, like that which the International Association is disposed to be, the conception of the future importance and value of this region to the markets of the world need be no great strain on the imagination.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agriculture on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In a very interesting report on economic agriculture on the Gold Coast, issued from the Colonial Office, some noteworthy information relating to the cultivation of cotton in that part of West Africa is included.

This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture.

This is brought down from the interior, and retains a large proportion of the fat or gelatine, from the fact, probably, that it is from the recently living animals. In this state it is called green ivory. It is not so white as the kinds called white ivory, which have been lying a longer time exposed to the heat of the sun until the animal matter has disappeared. The excellence of green ivory consists in its greater toughness and in its growing whiter by age, instead of yellow, as is the case with the whiter varieties. Yet buyers of cutlery, through ignorance of these qualities, usually prefer the whiter kinds, which on that account are more in demand for the Sheffield trade, and have more than doubled in price since 1879.\n\nThe sales of ivory occur every three months at London and Liverpool, and sales are also held at irregular intervals at Rotterdam. At Liverpool, only ivory of the best quality is offered. Buyers from Germany and France and agents of American consumers attend these sales; and it is estimated that about one quarter of the whole amount goes to Sheffield, another quarter to London, and the other half to Germany, France, and the United States. There is just now great anxiety as to the future supply of ivory. The stocks in public warehouses are smaller than for many years past, and the rapid increase in prices is causing great anxiety to manufacturers. At a recent sale at Liverpool, the best African ivory sold by the ton at over 12s. 6d. per pound. This will explain the fact that the principal factor in the value of the best table cutlery is the handle. When the ivory comes into the hands of the cutler, much skill is required to make the most of the material, and every scrap is turned to account.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life. Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

But from the end of the nineteenth century, the caravan trade started to decline. The colonization of other African countries brought about new and cheaper routes. Modern and more efficient methods of transportation replaced the old ones. Consequently, the importance of the caravan trade slowly diminished.

In the first half of the century, the principal groups of tracks or 'corridors' led to Luanda and Benguela. Three large economic and cultural regions were centred on the roads leading to Luanda: the Kongo region with its 'Mubire' (Vili) network of tracks which passed through the Kwango chiefdoms (especially Holo) and Encoge, an Angolan fortified outpost; the region comprising the western Lunda states, reached either by crossing the territory of the Imbangala of Kassanje and passing through Ambaca, another Angolan outpost, or by travelling through the Songo and Pungo Andongo country; finally, the Ovimbundu region, which maintained regular contacts with Pungo Andongo and the other Angolan posts in the Kwanza valley. The Ovimbundu highlands were linked to the coast by another route that led to Caconda and Benguela.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas.

When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Unprecedented commercial penetration from the East African coast during the nineteenth century resulted in the incorporation of most of Central Africa into the capitalist world economy. As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks. On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'reliance on captives enabled free men to collect ivory, wax and rubber for overseas export. The Lozi aristocracy and landlords also used slaves to dig canals and ditches in order to bring fertile marshy soil into cultivation. By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position. To the extent that slaves acquired as corvØe labourers tended to become chattel, the nature of slavery often changed from earlier forms which emphasized the reproductive role and the use of slaves primarily to expand the size of the kinship network. accompanied the raids and the expansionist activities of the slave-traders. Fields were ravished, entire villages destroyed and survivors often com› pelled to flee their homelands and resettle in inaccessible, unproductive locations. One nineteenth-century traveller recalled the effect of the Yao raids in the 1860s against the Manganja: A number of the Manganja went with them. Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert. About midday they came upon a large party of Ajawa [Yao], who were just returning from a successful raid. The smoke of burning villages was seen in the distance. A long train of captives carried the plunder,', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks. On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

We estimate that the cotton sent by steamers from Lagos to England may possibly now amount to say 1,400,000 pounds weight per annum. We want to see it raised from fourteen hundred thousand to fourteen million pounds. There is no reason why this should not be; but it never will be with the low prices in this market which are certain to rule in future, and a freight charge of ¾d. per pound, in addition to the heavy shipping expenses inseparable from the steamships receiving it on board outside the bar of Lagos. Let it be borne in mind that the steam rate will and must always regulate the sailing ship rate. Now let us take the 1,400,000 pounds as the quantity brought home by steamships. This, at ¾d. per pound, with 10 per cent. primage, gives to the steamships a revenue of 4,800l. There are now nearly that number, but from and after the 1st January next there will be fully fifteen steamships belonging to the two companies constantly engaged in the African trade. Each of these ships will make four voyages per year, a total in all of sixty voyages from the Coast to Liverpool. The 4,800l. derived from ¾d. per pound gives therefore an average of 80l. per voyage for cotton. Now we propose that they make the rate ½d. instead of ¾d. per pound. This would reduce the average to 40l. per voyage—or if the freight be made ¼d. to 50l. per voyage. What, therefore, is the present sacrifice that we ask them—more, that we implore them—to make for their own future interests and those of the African countries, the development of the resources of which depends so much upon their liberal treatment? We ask them seemingly to sacrifice 30l. or 40l. per ship per voyage—upon the voyage out and home of a steamer of from 1,000 to 1,500 tons: and we say seemingly, because a slight additional impulse given to cotton production will soon enable them to recoup the money from this and other sources; their unreduced outward freights for example, as the returns for every additional bale of cotton will be in manufactured or other goods from Liverpool by their ships. We invite and intreat their serious consideration of this advised reduction. The steamships are now becoming comparatively the sole carriers of palm-oil, &c., from the Coast, and it is to their interest that the trade should be so increased as to demand the employment by them of an additional number of steamers beyond the five voyages per month, which will commence in January next. We see a great future before these two steam companies; but they can only secure it by fostering every rising industry in Africa through low rates of freight, which are indispensable with regard to produce raised by a people new to industrial life, that will have (unlike palm-oil, of which Africa possesses a monopoly) to compete with similar products from other tropical countries, enjoying greater advantages in abundant organised capital and facilities of inland transit. We hope the two companies will make this reduction on the freight of cotton to ½d. or ¼d. per pound, the New Year's gift of 1871 to Africa. It will be a gift that must assuredly profit the donor, and that we shall record with gratitude."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-10-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Freight of Cotton from Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is especially our duty, as guardian of West African interests, to keep a vigilant watch upon commercial as well as administrative proceedings, that we may point the way to a removal of any impediment to that development of material resources on which the future welfare of the African countries so much depends. In doing this, one such impediment stands out in strong relief; while, in consequence of the rapid change now taking place in the mode of conducting the business of this country with West Africa, we feel convinced that it is only necessary we should throw a strong and just light upon it to lead to its speedy removal. This impediment is the rate of freight on cotton from West African countries to England. At the first glance it may be thought by the owners of steam and sailing ships trading with Africa that we are premature in mooting the subject of a reduction in the rates of freight on cotton. It may be urged by them that these rates have undergone a reduction of 50 per cent., and their first impulse will no doubt be to say that it is preposterous to expect they can be still further reduced. It is true, thanks to the British and African Steam Navigation Company, that the rate of freight on cotton is now 3d. per pound instead of 1¼d. per pound, as it was in the days of steam monopoly by the African Steamship Company; but, at the same time, it is equally true that the rate of 3d. per pound is still too high a rate for the products of an industry that needs to be nursed and encouraged, and is consequently an impediment to that increase in the growth of cotton in West Africa which is so desirable for the progress of the African countries and the interests of Great Britain. Only those who, thirsting for African advancement, were watching the onward march of African agricultural industry, were sensible of the great impediment to the cotton culture which 1¼d. per pound freight on cotton to England placed in its way. It was a grievous error of the African Steamship Company to impose such a freight on cotton. The earliest efforts made in cotton culture for exportation, under the munificent donation of Miss Burdett Coutts so ably applied by Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester, had established that cotton might be made in the course of time to figure largely in the exports of West Africa; that soil and climate favoured its growth, and that the natives in certain districts were willing to cultivate it for foreign markets. But 1¼d. per pound freight to Liverpool was a frightful obstacle, and the rate of progress was very slow until the disastrous civil war in America raised the price of New Orleans cotton from 5d. to above 2s. per pound. The African cotton from the Egba Countries is not much inferior to the New Orleans; it therefore approximated in value to the latter in the British markets, and the high price gave a stimulus to the African cotton industry which enabled it to triumph over the 1¼d. obstacle. Prices receded after the termination of the American war, but until lately they have been such as still to allow the production in Africa to progress, notwithstanding the 1¼d. and, later, as at present, 3d. freight. But the joint influence, temporarily of the European war, and, we believe permanently, of increased production in the United States, with the opening of new facilities of supply from India to England, via the Suez Canal, has caused a rapid fall in prices during the last few months, a fall which seems to point unmistakeably to prices somewhat similar to those which ruled immediately before the American struggle. We do not hesitate to say that this change of circumstance necessitates a change of rate of freight on cotton from Africa to England—necessitates it both in the interests of Africa and of the steam companies themselves. We are convinced that in what we are about to ask we are consulting their best interests. The interests of conveyers of produce from the Coast cannot be dissociated from those of the producers and traders. The African Steam Company did not see this heretofore; monopoly often creates blindness; but better counsels now prevail, a clearer sight has now been given, and we expect to see the now friendly rivals, the two great Steamship Companies, carefully watching the rise of any new agricultural industry in the African countries, and fostering and giving impetus to it by low rates of freight for the new product in the infancy of production. There are only three of the West African exports that depend entirely on what may be strictly called agricultural industry. These are ground-nuts, ginger, and cotton. The first of these has already established itself as a great staple, and may therefore be placed, more or less, although it has now a growing competition with the East Indies and other countries, in the same category with the grand staple, palm-oil, which may be left to take care of itself without any fear of prejudice thereby resulting to it. But cotton requires, demands, the nursing care of the shipowners. It has not, like palm-oil, a monopoly in European markets; it has to struggle against the organised production in America, the East Indies, Egypt, and other countries where a large capital and great facilities of transit, together with all the economising appliances which large capital only can command, give it great advantages. Under these circumstances it is to the interest, as we have before said, of this country, of the steam companies, and of Africa, that it should be treated with exceptional tenderness. And as the African advocate and guardian we earnestly ask this of them. We want to see this cotton industry so important to Great Britain, greatly and rapidly developed in the Egba, Yoruba, and Volta Countries. The latter, whenever a permanent pacification takes place, by the country becoming secured against Ashantee inroads, may be made a large cotton producer. Mr. J. C. Brandt, and one or two other Accra men, gave the first impulse, we believe, in Krepee, during the American war, and the German missionary traders followed profitably in the same path. The Ashantee invasion has for a time greatly impaired this industry, but there is every reason why, with so industrious a people as the Krepees, and good soil and climate, there should be a large exportation via the River Volta from Krepee, if the Steam Companies act on our suggestion. And we are not asking them to make any great present sacrifice to their own future and Africa's permanent interests. We are not going to ask them to bring cotton from Lagos or the Volta or Accra, to Liverpool, at freights lower than the average paid for cotton of other countries to that port. American cotton pays 7-16ths per pound freight by steamers from New York, or 3-16ths per pound by fast-sailing ships; African, even at the now reduced rates, pays 3d. per pound freight equally by the steamships and by those, for the most part, tubs of sailing ships, which manage to take three or four months, at best, to make the voyage. We are only asking them to do what is just and reasonable, and what will be to their own advantage in the long run."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-10-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agriculture on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In a very interesting report on economic agriculture on the Gold Coast, issued from the Colonial Office, some noteworthy information relating to the cultivation of cotton in that part of West Africa is included. Although cotton grows wild in the colony it is almost neglected, except in the Volta district, where Messrs. F. & A. Swanzy have plantations. The quantity exported is extremely small. This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture. The enormous number of silk-cotton trees in the colony would yield a plentiful supply if the people found it worth collecting and exporting, and the timber is used for making fishing canoes.\n\nRice also might be made an important crop on the Gold Coast. It is grown in the Axim and Quittah districts. In the former district a red variety is grown in the marshy plains. It is large, soft-grained, and sweet, resembling the Sierra Leone rice. In the Quittah district an upland sort is grown, and forms the staple food of the inhabitants. These two districts are capable of supplying the requirements of the whole colony, and other districts are adapted to the growth of this crop, in which a large and profitable foreign trade might be carried on, yet the colony imports largely, as will be seen by the following statement:', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained. For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Colonies at the Colonial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The data for Lagos are for 1862. Going back fifty years ago, to 1836, we find no definite statistics for the Gold Coast; while Gambia exported no less than in 1875—£147,000. The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony.

The present condition of the cotton trade must make all who are engaged in it wish for some other method than a resort to short time every year. I would ask whether it is possible to found a company for encouraging the growth of cotton in Africa by the natives in territory not dominated by Europeans; or where the domination is of such a sort that, whenever the natives are consolidated enough, they might be left to govern themselves. The field of operations should be on the west side of Africa, where we should be about as near as we are to New Orleans and require to pay no canal dues.

He thinks that an important trade with that country may be opened up. He pointed out that all the trade must be done through Lagos. For 500 miles along the coast of West Africa there was but one break of any importance in the monotonous stretch of steeply sloping shore, but one natural harbour where the waters of the lagoons escaped into the sea. With the exception of Lagos, there was no place where cargoes could be landed without danger of being damaged or destroyed. When in 1862 the English took possession of this port the name of Lagos stood out upon the map of the world as a hotbed of fever and a nest of slavery unequalled even in the Dark Continent. Apart from the slave trade there was little commercial activity in the place. Matters had improved since then. The health of the town was no worse than that of Kingston or other low-lying West Indian ports, and the inter-tribal wars which had caused misery to the inhabitants of the interior were being settled. In 1862 the imports were £77,932 9s. 7d. and the exports £61,952 9s. 4d., in 1866 the imports were £220,766 and the exports £262,699, and in 1879 the imports were £527,871 and the exports £654,379. Since 1879 the total values had remained, in round numbers, from £900,000 to £1,100,000, in spite of the steady decrease in the price of produce and of goods. When he mentioned that palm oil reached £52 per ton in 1862, and had sunk as low as £17 10s. in 1888 and 1889, it would be understood that the apparently stationary condition of the trade of Lagos during the past twenty years represented in reality an increase of about 100 per cent. in bulk. As shown in the tables of steam tonnage entered and cleared, the increase was still more remarkable. The trade of the colony came from four chief sources, which might be roughly described as the western or palm oil district, in the neighbourhood of the coastline; the Oguru river valley and Abeokuta, to the north; and the lagoon limits of the Jebu country and the strip of coastline known as the Lekki district, to the eastward. Still further towards the east was the Ondo route, which ran from Arijon, on the lagoon side through Ijesha and Ilorin to Shonga on the Niger. This last route might be considered as the main source of the supply of ivory and Niger produce to the Lagos market. It would appear that the output of produce in the western district of the colony had nearly reached its maximum for the present, and that the same might be said of the producing power of the Abeokuta neighbourhood. Perhaps a third of the total trade of the colony was derived from the eastward markets of Ijebu, Ondo, and Mahin, and his object now was to state a few facts which had an important bearing upon the question of the future development of this Eastern traffic. In the early months of the last year he was employed on a political mission to the interior of Yorubaland, and was greatly impressed with the commercial future of the Yorubas; and it would help the development of their prosperity if the interest of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce could be excited to encouraging more direct commercial relations with this people. Between Yorubaland and the coast was a large district inhabited by the Ijebus, who acted the part of middlemen, and strongly resented the intrusion of foreigners. They retained the whole of the interior traffic in their own hands. Mr. Millson gave a glowing account of the country further north, which he visited. Its several towns he described as populous, and the whole district as affording great inducements for trade. Ibadan was one of the chief towns, and Oyo, where the king resided, was a city of 40,000 people. From Ibadan to Oyo—which is about 800 ft. above the sea—the country was a veritable garden; food was extremely cheap, and roads good for foot passengers. The population of Central Yoruba, the area of which could not exceed 7,000 square miles, must be estimated at not less than 3,000,000. Each of the large towns was surrounded with farm villages and hamlets, which were scattered for many miles in all directions. It was a land of plenty, and in the more upland regions as healthy as most tropical countries. To turn from these considerations, he would mention a few facts which bore upon the commercial prospects of the country. To deal in the first instance with palm oil, it had to be accepted that the market was at present strictly limited to local consumption in consequence of the exactions of the middlemen, and that the price bore the same proportion to European values as that of other articles. Just as maize, which fetched only 4½d. for 70 lb. in Ibadan, was sold for 2s. 6d. to 4s. in Lagos, so palm oil in Ibadan was purchased for 2s. 6d. per 11 gallons, or £3. 15s. a ton, as compared with £17 10s. to £23 10s. in Lagos. Now when it was considered that the whole of the richer lands of Yoruba had scattered among the farms, on an average of from 12 to 30 to the acre, fully bearing palm trees (the fruit of which was allowed to rot upon the ground as soon as the limits of local demand were reached), it was clear that the supply of the coast markets would be increased at a most profitable rate were free communication possible. The native would eagerly avail himself of such an opportunity for increasing his wealth and indulging his taste for travelling, bargaining, and European luxuries. In the same way palm kernels, the shipments of which formed nearly half of the total exports of Lagos, commanded a merely nominal price in Yoruba. A measure of kernels was purchased by him at Ibadan for 1s. 6d. which would have fetched 5s. in Lagos. It was unreasonable to suppose that the Yoruba would hesitate to avail himself of such profits when he persisted in cultivating his land in so laborious a manner for the most minute gains earned by any labourer in the world. From Abeokuta alone, since its inhabitants had had free access to the markets of the coast, nearly half the trade of Lagos had its origin. Abeokuta was a large city of 100,000 inhabitants; but Ibadan was still larger, was hardly any further from the lagoon side, and was inhabited by a more industrious people. In addition to the supply of palm oil and kernels, Lagos would profit by a large supply of cotton which was already in demand among cotton spinners in England. He was informed by the Secretary of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce that they would be willing to accept as much as could be put upon the market. It was the opinion of competent observers that with the introduction of improved qualities of cottonseed the future of West Africa as a cotton-producing country would be of great importance. Experiments had been made in the Lagos Botanic Gardens with a view to discovering the quality of cotton most suitable to the soil and climate, and it would appear that Egyptian cotton offered an encouraging future to cultivators. A supply of seed was procured from the Government of Egypt, and sufficient quantities to enlarge the sphere of these experiments had been distributed among the kings and chiefs of the interior. An inquiry was to be made into the methods of planting followed in Egypt as compared with those adopted by the natives of Yoruba, and it was to be hoped that the interest shown by these people in agriculture would be directed into this new channel. Into the question of other articles of commercial importance it was not his intention to enter, but he might mention ivory, shea butter, benniseed, cotton cloths, fibres, gums, coffee, and cocoa as offering scope for the development of minor industries. When he stated that over 80,000 young plants of cocoa, coffee, cocoanut, kola, and other valuable trees had been distributed since the month of May 1888 by the botanic centre of the Colony of Lagos, and that over 60,000 of these had been purchased by the natives, it would be understood that one was not in error in counting upon their interest in agriculture as a means of profit as well as of actual maintenance. It must not be forgotten that the Yoruba was by custom a fully clothed mortal. It was considered unfashionable to appear in the public streets without a complete covering of two or three ample and well-dyed cloths draped round the body in not ungraceful folds. The Yorubas consumed each year about 31,500,000 yards of cotton, silk, grass, and mixture cloths. Of this large supply of cloth more than 95 per cent. was of home manufacture, made of home-grown cotton, dyed with native dyes, and woven of yarn spun by hand. Nearly 25 per cent. of the total population was engaged in preparing cloth for the native market. The richer cloths alone, such as silks, velvets, velveteens, satteens, and damasks, were purchased from Lagos through the Ijebu middlemen by the chiefs of the interior at most exorbitant rates, representing in many instances nearly 200 per cent. of profit. Accepting the annual consumption of native cloth in Yorubaland at 30,000,000 yards, and reckoning the price at not more than 3d. a yard, we had the somewhat startling figure of £375,000 as the value of the yearly output of the native looms. Assuming that European merchants would not be able to supplant more than half of this, we had an increase in the output of cotton goods alone amounting to £187,000. To this must be added an equal consumption of tobacco, spirits, hardware, &c., which should increase the imports of the colony by £400,000. This would, of course, represent an equal or greater export of palm oil, kernels, cotton, ivory, and other articles which had at present no market.\n39', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase.

In a perceptive passage he contends: France sought compensation for European loss in overseas gain. England would offset her European isolation by enlarging and glorify› ing the British empire. Russia, halted in the Balkans, would turn anew to Asia, and Germany and Italy would show the world that the prestige they had won by might inside Europe they were entitled to enhance by imperial exploits outside. The lesser powers, with no great prestige at stake, managed to get on without any new imperialism, though Portugal and Holland displayed a revived pride in the empires they already possessed and the latter's was administered with renewed vigor. 1S Hayes concludes therefore that 'the new imperialism' was basically 'a nationalistic phenomenon' and that its proponents hankered after national prestige. European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply.

The Master of the Mercers\' Company said his Court had voted £1,000 to this fund, and the Prime Warden of the Goldsmiths\' Company informed the Conference that a similar proposal would come before his Court at their next meeting.

It was a happy conception which first started the idea of an Exhibition, international in character, which in its scope and influence is sure to eclipse in interest and success the Exhibitions of the various industries and inventions which have, during the past few years, done so much to enliven the London season and attract to the metropolis those shoals of country cousins whose presence among us we are more accustomed to associate with the approach of the Christmas season. But what the Fisheries, the Healtheries, and the Inventories have been to England as a country, the Colonial and Indian Exhibition will be to Great Britain as an Empire. In this particular the forthcoming Exhibition will be distinguished from all the great ""world\'s fairs"" that have preceded it—it will be British. It is a family show—a friendly competition among the Dependencies of these little Islands which have become the mother of so many nations, or of Colonies which are independent in everything but name. It has a political significance. Hitherto we have welcomed the foreigner. This year we keep South Kensington to ourselves. Whatever may be our rivalries, no matter how widely different may be the aspirations, the interests, or even the languages of the competitors, one and all acknowledge the same supreme Ruler. Even with this limitation, there will be more than enough to fill every inch of space at the disposal of the Commissioners. Among the many objects of interest in the Exhibition, surely the chief will be the colonials themselves. Hundreds of our distant fellows will seize the opportunity of visiting the land which to the majority at least is known as ""home."" Their varied humours, and complexions, and manners cannot fail to be a source of endless instruction and suggestion. Such an Exhibition will do more for the Confederation of the Empire than reams of pamphlets and avalanches of speeches. It will show the Colonists that we are not unmindful of them, though sometimes, out of the cares engendered by more pressing affairs nearer home, we fail to enter as fully into their views as they consider we ought to do. They have built up great dependencies, as populous as, and in many cases more wealthy than, some European kingdoms. Cities like Sydney and Melbourne have developed a magnificence and a culture of which any community might be proud, and have grown with a speed not distanced by even Chicago or San Francisco. Cyprus, Gibraltar, Hong-Kong, and Malta are valuable as military stations; but Canada, the Cape, and Australia are the homes of our countrymen, in whose loyalty we trust, of whose affection we are proud; the links that bind us are the links of brotherhood, and the old country bids them a right hearty welcome to her shores.

The Somalis are characterised by good temper and intelligence, and display a degree of pride in their bearing.

Among the animals are 25 small, wiry little horses, which walked ashore and into the horse-boxes with much promptness. Other arrivals were the 20 racing camels of the one-humped kind. These made a fine show in two groups, and seemed in excellent health. The other wild animals included lions, cheetahs, hyenas, jackals, dogs, monkeys, baboons, gazelles, and antelopes. There were also 4 donkeys, 60 sheep and goats, 6 large ostriches, and some tortoises. A second ship is to bring 20 lions, 11 elephants, 4 zebras, 19 ostriches, 6 leopards, 4 pythons, and a large number of monkeys and small animals.\n\nViews of the Somali country have been painted and give a realistic presentation of African scenery. There will be races and other Native performances, and the English at home will be able to make acquaintance with some of the most interesting features of life in the great African continent. The Somalis are British subjects, and their sojourn here should lead to proper appreciation of a race which possess some of the finest physical qualities. Mr. Carl Hagenback, to whom the credit of the enterprise is due, commenced his commercial connexions with Somaliland in 1874.

Many of these ornaments form part of the tribute paid by the King of Ashanti after the war of twelve years ago.

But he reminded his hearers that British West Africa is not a field for Anglo-Saxon colonisation. While there are tracts in the interior, where Europeans could lead happy and healthy lives, the west in general is a land of negroes. The mass of the population must always be of the negro race. Through the use of proper means Mr. Johnston is convinced the native race can be civilised and rendered industrious to a very satisfactory extent. Mr. Johnston's theory is that England should enlarge its borders to the utmost. British trade is the lever he proposes for the enlightenment of the black race. The more the territory which is acquired the more can that influence be exerted. With British trade the appliances of European civilisation are bound to advance.\n\nThey will fast educate the negro both morally and intellectually.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'West Africa is one of the richest mineral regions on the planet, and England has been given an entrance to it for the purpose of spreading a civilisation and Christianity that will not do harm to the cause of the Gospel or bring disgrace on morality.

Why have we not been in Bambara years ago? A light railway should have been run up to the north-east. The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers. They are tapping all that rich region while we remain inert.\n\nWest Africa has, from interested motives, been represented as unhealthy for Europeans. This illusion is being rapidly dispelled by disinterested travellers. The Englishman, through unhealthy habits, may dig his own grave even in England, as so many thousands do annually. Besides, were London as innocent of sanitary arrangements as Freetown, it would soon become the white man\'s grave in grim reality. A man unaddicted to drink and gluttony may live, and does live, an enjoyable life in West Africa; he enjoys it so much that, like Emin Pasha, he refuses to be rescued. Officers and others have told me they preferred being out there for a time, not only because they liked the life, but because ""dear old Cox"" has been able to transfer the balance of their account from the debit to the credit side.\n\nWest Africa is the coming country; it teems with wealth; it is within easy distance of this country, and can be brought within six days of the London market if necessary.

Some of these vegetable products grow wild. Horses, camels, and sheep, can be bred in the north-east. The list of articles to be found on the coast reads like the inventory of a Liverpool warehouse. The wealth of West Africa is simply boundless, illimitable.

Behind is a fine specimen of one of Mr. Du Chaillu\'s gorillas. The main exhibits in the lower gallery are arranged geographically in the numerous panels around the walls. On one side spears are the most conspicuous objects, and the variety of type is quite striking. We have spears from Somaliland, the Masai country, the Congo, Uganda, Swaziland, the Nyassa region, the Tanganyika region. Nearly all of these spears, as well as the other exhibits, have been collected by explorers whose names are famous, men like Livingstone, Speke and Grant, Stanley and Thomson, Johnston, and many missionaries; the officials of the Congo Free State, and others. Very varied are the types of axes, many of them of elaborate form. Bows and arrows are not numerous; but shields are plentiful and varied, and it is of interest to note that the Zulu shield extends to the latitude of Zanzibar, where we find a tribe long settled there, and yet retain many of the old Zulu customs. Some of the personal ornaments are most extraordinary. There are anklets like enormous brass plates, with a hole through the centre; others made of bars of copper, each over a pound weight. Then some of the ""money"" is of a strange character. The utensils of metal and pottery are as varied as the weapons. One exhibit which will no doubt interest many visitors is the complete equipment for a horse brought by Mr. Thomson from Sokoto.\n\nSome of the objects in the glass cases will probably prove among the most attractive exhibits. There are Livingstone\'s Consular cap and sword, and his simple knife and fork and sugar basin. One of Gordon\'s famous Khartoum notes, lent by Sir H.

Inside one enters the camp of an explorer: the tent, the table, camp stools, cooking utensils, observing instruments, bales of goods, and the other baggage with which an African explorer must encumber himself. The camp is pitched in the midst of some extraordinary scenery. On one side it looks out upon the houses of Bagamoyo and the sea beyond; on the other side there is the Congo rushing over Stanley Falls, while round the corner is the Aruwimi forest, with Mount Ruwenzori in the far distance. Passing through the encampment, one finds himself face to face with a bust of the Queen, opposite which is a full-length portrait of the King of the Belgians. Near these are two excellent portraits of Mr. Stanley, with a variety of articles, against a background of tastefully arranged and appropriate drapery. Madagascar grass mats drape the pillars, while here and there will be seen some wonderful grass fabrics, soft as velvet, with patterns of ingenuity.

One is a Portuguese map of the seventeenth century, in which the ""Empire of Monomotapa"" is represented as extending across the continent.

Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WOULD-BE ASHANTI ENVOYS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The steamer Accra arrived at Grand Canary on April 16, _en route_ for Liverpool, having on board the _soi-disant_ Ashanti Ambassadors, who are visiting England in the hope of waiting upon the Queen to lay before her Majesty a full statement of their case.

Further south it was a different world, that of Upper Guinea, where decentralized farming peoples, speaking mostly West Atlantic languages, had long occupied the sea coast. From Monrovia to the Gambia, the Sudanic zone only began to have contacts with the sea coast in the eighteenth century. This region was also one of the earliest centres of European influence in Guinea-Bissau, home of Creole culture, and later Sierra Leone and Liberia. Like Senegambia, this region was important for the slave trade in the sixteenth century, though, in the eighteenth century, its role declined.\nOutside the coastal area, the two most important peoples were the Mandinka and the Fulbe (Fulani, Peul). The Mandinka empire of Kaabu (Gabu) dated back to the thirteenth century and had been independent of old Mali since the sixteenth. The Fulbe had been in the area since at least the fifteenth century but had founded the Muslim state of Futa Jallon only after 1727.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, Portuguese influence was in decline, but the clandestine slave trade was to continue for quite a time on both sides of the anti-slavery centre of Sierra Leone. Mandinka Kaabu had trouble maintaining its influence as far as the southern shores of the Gambia, and failed altogether with its former vassals the Ba'inuk, on the coast. The Foa (Balanta), non-centralized peasants, destroyed the Ba'inuk capital in 1830, and most of the survivors joined the Mandinka or else the Joola (Dyula), the hardy 'anarchic' traditionalist rice-growers who occupied the whole coastal area to the north. In the east, the Fulbe of Futa Jallon dominated the Mandinka as far as the Gambia in Kantora. In Kaabu and its dependencies, a Fulbe minority was growing increasingly impatient with its subordinate position.\nAt this period, the French set up trading posts in the Casamance, at Karabane in 1836 and then at Seeju (Sediou) in 1838.

Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior.

Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

Driven to Bimbia by his paternal kinsmen, he attached himself to his senior maternal uncle, who employed him as his emissary in his dealings with the Europeans because of his previous experience from the Cameroon river. Bile acquired wealth, new experience, and influence, and was chosen as the logical successor to his uncle. In 1833, Bile was able to convince the British representative in Fernando Po, Colonel Nicolls, to recognize him as king of the entire coastal region from Bimbia to Rio del Rey, including its offshore Bubi islands, in return for ceding the same region to Britain as a protectorate. Although the British rejected the voluntary cession, Bile retained the title of king until his death in 1879. The separate polities of Duala and Bimbia thus developed ties in the nineteenth century. Cultural ties were reinforced by Jengu solidarity, as well as by King William's part-Duala ancestry. In commerce, Bimbia and Bell Town traders co-operated in developing the trade of the Rio del Rey area. They developed two major routes. First was the coastal route through the creeks linking the two areas, much as is still the case today. Some Bimbia and Duala traders resided at different villages along the route to receive goods for exchange with the local people. Second was the overland route which served as an alternative when stormy weather and rough seas made the creek route unsafe. This route round Mount Cameroon also tapped the resources of ivory.

In the Cameroon river and Bimbia, as in Calabar and the Niger delta, slaves were used in producing palm oil and palm kernels and other commodities of legitimate commerce. At Bimbia and the Cameroon river, an important variation was the well-organized system by which Kings William and Bell hired out some of their slaves to the West African Company at Fernando Po.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar 1800-80', 'section_title': 'The great modernizer: King Radama I (1810-28)', 'content': ""goods. Moreover, Madagascar was important for political and strategic considerations. In particular, the British wanted to secure the support of the ruler for the abolition of the slave trade, since Madagascar was one of the main sources of slaves in the region. It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert. The Governor therefore sent another mission to Radama's capital, this time led by James Hastie, a former Sergeant at Arms in India and more experienced in handling negotiations with oriental rulers.$^{13}$ Hastie brought along with him a number of gifts for the king, including horses, a compass, a map of the world and a chiming clock, all of which greatly impressed the young king and helped Hastie to win his love and confidence. The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar. The Anglo-Malagasy Treaty of Friendship and Commerce was signed at Tamatave on 23 October 1817.

The acquisition of firearms, especially, increased their capability to raid others.\nAs they raided, they accumulated cattle, hoes, ivory and captives; the last two could be sold to coastal traders for all kinds of luxury goods including textiles, bracelets, beads, tableware and, above all, firearms. Larger states could raid smaller ones, but all of them raided the neighbouring noncentralized communities, who suffered the most. The exception of Rwanda and Burundi (already mentioned) shows that it was possible to form an alternative strategy in dealing with this penetration of trade.

Their extensive wars and raids during the period enabled them to accumulate wealth in a situation in which ivory and captives were irrelevant.\nThe second region we have deliberately omitted in this section is southern Tanzania.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 437, 'article_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'full_section_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'last_edit_date': '09-23-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-1', 'issue_date': '23_09_1864', 'content': ""A report having reached us some time since that the authorities in the Gambia were in favour of a joint English and French expedition against the Mohammedan chief, Mahaba, who has acquired so much influence in the Gambia districts lying between that river and the French possessions south of the Senegal, we thought it our duty to refer to persons trading up the Gambia, and with the territory now under the rule of Mahaba, as to the necessity of such a step. We think we need not say that we are not in favour of little colonial wars, and certainly there was nothing obtained in the last Badiboo expedition up the Gambia to induce us to look with hope and favour upon a new campaign. Without expressing any opinion, however, we referred the matter to the Gambia native traders. The result has been an almost unanimous expression of opinion that the work which Mahaba has been performing (although, like that of all conquerors, it has been attended with much suffering) is a beneficent one, and likely to result in a great increase of material development, and consequently of profitable trade and of public revenue in the Gambia. We are assured that, as regards Mahaba, the only beneficial action that can be performed by the Colonial Governor is to have placed without delay those marks for defining the limits of the British territory of Badiboo the necessity of which we have some time since pointed out, and to obtain, if possible, that the traders should be allowed to reside out of Mahaba's town when carrying on trade really in his territories.\n\nWe subjoin some of the opinions expressed, which, as they are the voice of experience, seem to us unanswerable.

It may be, nevertheless, that our sympathies are uncalled for and misplaced,—that the way in which British law has been administered among them of late years has so alienated their affections from Great Britain, that they will rather rejoice than sorrow at their forthcoming transfer to France. When, on a former occasion, a few years ago, such a transfer was in contemplation, and the negotiations for it between the two Governments were almost concluded, we fought their battle with all our might, and fought it so successfully, in conjunction with earnest, sympathizing, and influential friends, that the negotiations were broken off and the transfer was prevented. We received at the time expressions of gratitude; and yet from that very time we may date an almost total failure of payment of subscriptions to the African Times; we say almost total, because at the Gambia, as elsewhere, there have been a few who have recognized their duty to us in this respect, and faithfully performed it. Since then, we have fought, and successfully, another battle for them, obtaining the release of many of them, otherwise hopelessly doomed to continued imprisonment for debt; and such a change of laws respecting debt and its recovery, as should prevent the future incarceration of honest debtors. But though we again received flattering words and seemingly heartfelt thanks, which were very precious to us, there has been but little pecuniary acknowledgment by payment of subscriptions; and the Gambia, its people, their affairs, and their condition, have not been brought much under our notice by those whom we consider to be our subscribers, whether they pay their subscriptions or not. As we have been cognizant of the negotiations pending between the British and French Governments for the transfer which was prevented in 1870, and nevertheless have not received one word from the educated natives of the Gambia, indicating apprehension or complaint, or praying that we would again interfere on their behalf, we can only conclude that opinions have changed at the Gambia since 1869; that what they then deprecated has no longer any terror in their eyes, and that they rather desire now what seemed then to be so feared by them. Since the transfer to France seems now to be inevitable, we hope and believe that their sentiments and feelings have undergone that change, so that they are perfectly reconciled and willing to become inhabitants of a French, instead of an English colony. And we think it is possible that their material interests may be in some way benefited by the change. They do not seem to us to have prospered materially under British rule in the same degree that men of their class have prospered in other British settlements on the Coast. This has been owing, no doubt, to the exceptional way in which the trade and commerce of the Gambia have been conducted—owing to the very limited space within which British administration and protection have been confined, more especially since the withdrawal of the West India troops, and the diminished frequency of visits, and ascents of the river by Her Majesty's ships of war. Everything, we must confess, that could safely be done has been done by the British Government during the past five years to alienate the affections of the people from British dominion, and cause or induce them to desire some change that might open to them a wider field of exertion and give them a more efficient protection. This wider field and this more efficient protection will, we do not at all doubt, be theirs when the British authorities shall have retired, and the French have taken their place at Bathurst. French protection and authority on the River Senegal do not confine themselves within a small tract of land near the mouth of the river, and a space of a mile or so from each bank for the distance of, say, 100 miles. They are made effective over a large extent of country, and the French Government has not shrunk from any expense to increase the area of trade and protect and encourage its traders. Such will also, no doubt, be the course it will pursue on the Gambia when it shall have acquired that neglected and foolishly depreciated British possession. We shall not re-enter now on the subject of the imperial interests which rendered a retention of the Gambia as a British possession a matter of national importance; nor is it worth our while to show how very largely the trade and commerce might have been increased, had the national importance of a continued possession of the River Gambia been understood and acknowledged. The decree may now be said to have gone forth, because we at least know that the partial denial by Mr. Lowther in the House of Commons on the 30th of July had only for object the prevention of any discussion on the subject during the few days then remaining of the late Session. The subsequent reference to the same subject in the House of Lords by the Earl of Carnarvon confirms us in the belief that the whole question is practically settled; and as we do not see anything in his lordship's assurances that of necessity prevents such a thing being done, we feel persuaded that, before Parliament shall again assemble, the negotiations will have been finally concluded, the pact will have been signed, the honour of the country will demand the fulfilment of what has been deliberately undertaken by its Government, and the transfer will probably have been effected; so that nothing will remain to be done save to notify, in Her Majesty's name, to the Legislature, when it meets for the Session of 1876, that such transfers by France and by England of settlements and territories on the West Coast of Africa is un fait accompli, and an irrevocable national act on the part of Great Britain, as well on that of France. While we hope and believe that the industrial, the material interests of the educated native traders on the Gambia will be now benefited rather than prejudiced by the Gambia being transferred to France, we venture to hope also that their spiritual interests will not be prejudiced thereby. The Wesleyan Missionary Society will not, we feel sure, withdraw from the work in which it has so long been engaged there. As Roman Catholicism will, we presume, have a direct support from the Government, there will be so much the more need of assistance to the native Wesleyan congregations from the Society in England, and this will doubtless be given to them by it. We shall watch with no slight degree of interest the progress of events in the colony under French government, laws, and influences, nor ever cease to feel a deep concern in the welfare of those for whom we have so long watched and laboured.""}, {'id': 2984, 'article_title': 'The Proposed French and English Exchange of West African Settlements', 'full_section_title': 'The Proposed French and English Exchange of West African Settlements', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-13', 'issue_date': '01_11_1875', 'content': 'be a correct one; it is possible that we are mistaken in it; but we do sincerely believe, considering the nature of the chief Gambia products, and that the French are the best markets for the sale of them, that although it may be impossible for the British traders to remain at the Gambia under French rule and laws, the trade and commerce of the river will so greatly increase as to give a far higher value to the houses, stores, &c., than they now possess.

Here, as elsewhere on the coast, rice which has come from China, India, or Burmah to England is imported to feed people who are too indolent to cultivate the ground for their own sustenance. The merchants of Senegal have also tapped the trade which used to come to Bathurst, and the increase in prosperity of Senegal has been largely brought about at the expense of the Gambia. It would be difficult to do much to change the condition of this forlorn colony; but still, by means of the river and, when it had to be abandoned, by journeys through countries which are by no means difficult for the explorer or trader to penetrate, trade might be pushed forward, and the exports brought back to their ancient and natural outlet. Some nine years ago there was a great discussion about our giving the Gambia to France and receiving the Gaboon in exchange. A great deal of opposition was raised and much nonsense talked about the cruelty of handing over to the French of loyal subjects of the Crown.""}]","[{'document_title': 'The Present Outlook on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The people who would have been transferred would probably, for the most part, have known nothing of their change of nationality, and there can be little doubt that the material prosperity of the colony would have been increased by its being joined to Senegal and receiving attention similar to that which has been lavished on the neighbouring French possessions, whilst in the Gaboon we should have received what even then would have been a valuable equivalent. — *Manchester Guardian.*', 'last_edit_date': '1885-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1885#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST AFRICAN SETTLEMENTS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have formerly opposed, and successfully, any cession of the Gambia by Great Britain, to France.

The testimony to the entire discontinuance of the slave-trade, under any name or pretext, by France, has been general and convincing. On slave-trade suppression grounds there would now consequently be no loss by the substitution of French for British rule in the Gambia. If, therefore, because of economical considerations—because of the poverty of its exchequer, Great Britain declines to exercise such jurisdiction over the river and the natives along its banks, from the sea to M\'Carthy\'s Island, as will as effectually repress violence, robbery, and war, stimulate production and commerce, and aid voluntary efforts for the dissemination of Christianity, we see no justification in her retaining the Gambia, provided the French Government will consent to acquire it on reasonable terms, and under such stipulations for entire freedom of trade, and protection to Christian missions, as we feel convinced the enlightened Emperor of the French would willingly agree to. Possessing both the Senegal and the Gambia, and having already a preponderating influence in the neighbouring rivers south of the latter, and supposed to be in their upper portions in near proximity to it, as the Senegal is to the northward, the French Government, which, fortunately for African civilization, still possesses sufficient pecuniary resources to enable her to expend a few thousands a-year for bringing the over-warring natives under a peaceful restraint, as the only foundation for future enlarged production, commerce, and civilization, might, in a short time, succeed in giving a new aspect to regions whose fertility is beyond dispute, and which possess an adequate population inclined to agricultural pursuits.\n\nFor British reasons we should indeed deeply—deeply deplore such a cession of the Gambia to France. To retire from British territory in any part of the world is a serious thing; but if we are to abandon every noble, Christian, and humanitarian, as well as commercial aspiration at the dictum of a miserable economy, our country would only be dishonoured by a longer stay at the Gambia.

The Gambia Settlement is flanked on either side by countries exporting gum largely, and yet, odd as it may seem, this article has not so far ranked among the exports from this grand river. Although those interested commercially have endeavoured to convince me to the contrary, I have personally made it my business to look into the matter, and have succeeded in assuring myself, by specimen proof, of the local existence of the same gum as is exported annually by millions of pounds weight from the adjacent colony of Senegal. Indigenous in Fouta D\'jalon, which is laved by the Upper Gambia, is coffee, which, originally from that source, has now by dint of energy, speculation, and cultivation become an article of export from the rivers that lie between this colony and Sierra Leone; yet coffee has never been put thence on the market. Beniseed, corn, and rice might be luxuriantly grown and developed in an agricultural sense to a sufficiency not only for home consumption, but also for profitable export. The ""Gofio"" eating people of the Canaries and Cape Verde Islands present a near and fixed market for Indian corn, of which there might be obtained here two crops a year. There is much room both as to space and adaptability of soil for the extensive growth of the oil palm, the cocoanut palm, the castor oil, and cotton plants. The turqueira (physic) nut is to be found here—though not extensively, yet in luxuriant form. Much attention is now given to its growth in the adjoining Cape Verde Islands. Some years ago the Gambia was well represented in the European timber markets; it yet offers a field rich in its celebrated mahogany, rosewood, ebony, runs, &c. The last mentioned thrives better in water than out of it, and would answer for foundations of buildings in Holland. The local rubber industry began to develop in 1882, and by the extension of proper instructions in modes of collection, as also in the establishment of a proper knowledge of the value of the vines, so as to avoid their wholesale destruction, has room for much increase. Unfortunately here, as elsewhere in the collection of rubber, it is a regular case, I fear, of killing the goose for the golden egg. The value of the exports in this commodity in 1883 was £6,047, and in 1884, £23,213. For a local trade, especially in tomatoes—so largely consumed by the Wolofs of these parts—kitchen gardening might be promoted with considerable pecuniary advantage, much more so than is the case. Results have proved that cabbages, tomatoes, lettuce, beetroot, parsley, watercress, pumpkins, melons, pine apples, guavas, bananas, mangoes, even European strawberries, as fine as could be desired, may be grown here during certain months of the year. Under ""Mail Service"" I remarked upon the means existing for telegraphic communication with Europe. Direct telegraphic communication hence with Europe, either by means of the laying of a cable between Dakar and Bathurst, seventy or eighty miles, or by the extension of the Senegal land wire (fifty miles), or by the continuation of the cable European connexion with St. Vincent (270 or 280 miles), Cape Verde Islands; a more liberal and convenient mail service both with England and Sierra Leone; a lowering of the English freight tariff, so as to admit of more direct and full import of English goods; the lighting up of the sea approach and entry to the Gambia; a new Government wharf or landing stage, laid with tramways, of sufficient size to accommodate at one time two average-sized steamers for the centralization and expedition of the local import and export trade; rapid means of personal locomotion by tramcar to Cape St. Mary, the health resort of this capital, now more than ever that the Oyster Creek Bridge has been finished; reclamation of and filling in of swampy land adjoining Bathurst; a new Court House; extended gaol accommodation; road and street improvements; a public library, and an improved water-supply,—represent wants of much moment to the development of this settlement, which, it is to be hoped, may gradually come at no distant date within the sphere of practicable and visible improvements.

Expeditions are rapidly following one another and giving us full information about the interior of Equatorial Africa. Railways and canals are proposed for the opening up of that part of Africa, and they will, years hence, no doubt, prove an incalculable benefit; but why should we wait for these costly works? Why not utilize the arteries already provided by nature for traffic with the interior? Northwest Africa is a market to a great extent as yet unworked. The markets of Sego and Timbuctoo, Hamdallahi, and other large towns on the Upper Niger are most inadequately supplied with British goods by caravans from Tunis, Tripoli, Mogador, and Senegal, and the carriage is so expensive that none but the lightest and most valuable can be imported across the desert. Now the French river, Senegal, though it drains the country for over 700 miles, is practically useless as a channel of commerce. It has a bad and dangerous bar. Ships have often to lie outside weeks, and even months, waiting to enter the port of St. Louis. Its channel into the interior is full of sand bars and rocks, obstructing navigation by even small craft for most of the year; and the tribes to the north-east of its head-waters, of Arab origin, are ferocious and predatory, living by plunder; therefore, commerce meets with danger and difficulty in their neighbourhood. About 180 miles to the south is the Gambia, which seems intended by nature to be the main road for commerce, civilization, and religion into North-west Africa. At all states of the tide, at all seasons of the year, you have a deep and safe channel over the bar; vessels of 2,000 to 3,000 tons can come in and anchor off Bathurst, and discharge and load. The traffic up the river is carried on by large cutters and schooners. Even oceangoing vessels of large tonnage go up to M\'Carthy Island, 185 miles from the mouth, and load. Lately, an ocean steamer, of about 900 tons, went there direct from Marseilles, and loaded there; and at the present moment, a French firm trading in Gambia is building a 1,200-ton steamer to run between Marseilles and that island every season, and discharge and load there, instead of breaking bulk at Bathurst. At M\'Carthy Island there are five fathoms of water in mid-channel. Then, vessels drawing ten feet of water can go up to Yarbutenda, 160 miles further; so that had we steamers suited for the trade, like the French vessels I have mentioned, they could load at Liverpool or London, reach Bathurst in twelve days, M\'Carthy Island in twenty-four hours, Yarbutenda in twenty-four hours more, making fourteen days in all.""', 'last_edit_date': '1879-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1879#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Decline of Trade at the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""COMMERCE—the only medium by which a country's wealth can be effectually and thoroughly ascertained, its inhabitants benefited, and civilization diffused among her children, however primitive—is here rapidly on the decline. Undoubtedly the Gambia is prolific in all those products conducive to the success of commercial enterprise were only proper stimulus applied in that direction. The great error committed by the merchants of this place in former years, and the effect of which is now severely felt, was that in directing their efforts to the cultivation and promotion of the ground-nut they gradually neglected those products which had been to them their sole source of wealth, and as the trade in the ground-nut increased in magnitude, so the others declined, until we are now only apprised of their former existence by referring to the old books of the late merchants. The trade in gold, ivory, hides, wax, &c., formerly so lucrative not only in respect to its intrinsic value, but also as to its being attended with little or no expense to the buyer, is now nearly extinct, and the rich caravans have found a better and brisker market among our French neighbours on the Senegal, whilst their brother traders in Sino and Saloum threaten to deprive us of our last source of wealth—viz., the ground-nut, if source of wealth it can be termed. The demand for the ground-nut in our market is yearly more limited, and in the French market the Gambia nut has lost its value owing to depreciation in weight and quality of late years. The only remedy for the present evil is to seek for some other produce, and, happily, this is not wanting; only give the native encouragement, and he will work. Indigo, cotton, castor oil, croton, palm, and other oil-producing plants might all prove a mine of wealth. An example of the rapid progress which the trade in these products might make is to be had in the now flourishing India-rubber trade, to the promotion of which much praise is due to Mr. Carl Beving, agent for the enterprising company of Senegal et cote Occidentale d'Afrique. Let us hope that the merchants being awakened to the seriousness of the present state of affairs, may avert the impending danger by such measures as would tend to induce the native planters to turn their attention to the cultivation of a more profitable and less laborious article than the ground-nut.—Bathurst Observer"", 'last_edit_date': '1884-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Manchester Chamber of Commerce', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""intended transfer. Colonel Valiere stated that his visit was not an official one, as the transfer of the Gambia to the French had not been completed; but he could assure them that taxation would be very considerably reduced and ample protection to trade would be afforded, and he would be glad to hear their opinions on the subject. The merchants replied they had received no intimation of the transfer, nor had they any idea of the terms or conditions proposed, but they stated that they preferred to remain under the British flag. The native traders and inhabitants protested most strongly against being handed over to France. On the 8th of June the French admiral went up the river as far as Badiboo, in the gunboat Etoile, accompanied by some of the British officials. It was stated that the object of the visit up the river was to exhibit the French flag there. The natives up the river are much alarmed and incensed even at the proposal to hand over their river to the French; and, by accounts just received from Bathurst, information has been received that the natives have threatened to invade M'Carthy's Island, up the River Gambia, to burn and destroy the factories there, and to carry off the goods of the merchants into the interior before the French get possession. It is certain that the transfer of Gambia to France will be attended with very serious losses to the British merchants and traders settled there. The whole trade is carried on on the banks of the river, and the merchants are obliged to give out large amounts of property on credit. During the trading season goods and property to the value of about 250,000l. belonging to the British are at stake in the hands of the natives, and it is to be feared that they, having so great a dread of the French, would leave the banks of the river and retire inland, and there is no doubt the merchants would thereby lose nearly half their goods and property. The trade, which is prosperous, would materially suffer by the transfer, and the large and expensive mercantile establishments which are now required would be very much deteriorated in value, thus increasing the loss the British merchants would sustain by being transferred to the French Government. It may be added that the settlements in Gambia entail no expense whatever to England; the troops have been wholly withdrawn, as also all Parliamentary grants. The annual exports of the Gambia amount to about 140,000l. The revenue is raised by taxes on the trade, such taxes being imposed by the Legislative Council, which consists of three Government officers and of only one merchant, all appointed by the Crown; the taxpaying community are always out-voted, and consequently inadequately represented. The estimated revenue for 1870 amounts to 17,100l. An unnecessarily large staff of civil officers, appointed by the Crown, is maintained, contrary to the wishes of the colony. Their salaries and allowances alone swallow up annually 10,697l.; in addition to this a sum of 1,053l. is paid by the colony for pensions of retired officers—thereby nearly seventy-five per cent. of the revenue raised by the colony is paid to the servants of the Crown, in whose appointments the taxpayers have no voice, and these Crown officials have no interest in the colony beyond drawing their salaries and pensions. Under the present Administrator and Governor-in-Chief, all appointments in Gambia have been filled up either from England or from Sierra Leone, to the entire exclusion of persons born or residing in the settlements, who contribute to its revenue. It may also be mentioned, that notwithstanding these heavy Imperial charges on the inhabitants, the colony has expended in Bathurst alone fully 30,000l. on public works and buildings, and by order of the Crown it has invested a surplus of 4,200l. in New Zealand bonds. The prosperity of the settlement, and the requirements of the trade, induced British merchants to erect considerable establishments and dwelling-houses, the value of which may be estimated at not less than 60,000l.; to realise this property a great sacrifice would have to be made. Merchants having establishments and property in the river cannot possibly dispose of them or liquidate their affairs under a considerable time, during which they would be compelled to carry on their trade to great disadvantage, and would be subject to the French laws as regards the disposal of all their property.*"", 'last_edit_date': '1870-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1870#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Proposed French and English Exchange of West African Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Irrespective of Imperial considerations and views, and of the questions of West African development and civilization involved in the matter of the proposed exchange of British and French settlements in West Africa, there must necessarily be particular and personal interests that would be affected by such changes of rule and system as are involved in the proposed measure, should it be carried into effect. These particular and personal interests have grown up under British rule in the Gambia, and are the only ones on the West Coast of any importance that would be jeopardized or interfered with by the contemplated transfers. The British free trade policy, which has opened the ports of all our settlements and colonies to foreign commerce, differs so essentially from the French protective system, under which, as at the Senegal, for instance, all possible British competition is prohibited, that the British merchants having establishments on the River Gambia—establishments, some of which were founded more than half a century ago—are very naturally apprehensive that in coming under the restrictive French colonial system, instead of the liberal British one, their interests will be seriously jeopardized; or, in brief, that they would very soon be driven out altogether from the Gambia as a French colony or settlement. We cannot say that these apprehensions are unfounded, and we have therefore not been at all surprised to find that the British merchants having establishments on the Gambia have been holding private meetings in London, during the past month, for mutual counsel and agreement as to the best course for them to pursue for their own protection in this emergency. We sympathize with them, and do not hesitate to say that it would be unjust on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to make the proposed exchange without some stipulation that shall protect their absolute interest. As we are strangers to their counsels, we have not heard what is their estimate of these interests, or what special course of action they may have decided to adopt in defence of them. We have, however, a very decided opinion of our own in the matter, and that opinion we shall unreservedly express. First, then, we think they will be very unwise if they adopt the course of opposition to the Imperial policy in this matter, either on Imperial grounds or on the grounds of any supposed rights that the Native populations in the Gambia may have to a continuance of British rule in their countries. These are questions with which as British merchants they have not any concern. Like all other British subjects, they may express fully and freely their opinions respecting them, but they will not be wise if they do more. Their opposition to the Imperial policy would necessarily have little or no weight, because it could not be separated from, but would infallibly be regarded as influenced by, personal considerations. We helped them in 1869-70 to fight the battle against the transfer of the Gambia to the French, on Imperial grounds, because the transfer, as then proposed, was motived by considerations unworthy of such an empire as that of Great Britain, and certain to bring upon her an enduring disgrace. The motives of Government action are, however, at the present time essentially different. It is no longer a question whether ten or twenty thousand pounds a-year can be saved to the Imperial exchequer by getting rid of the Gambia. That economy was made without getting rid of it. We cannot, therefore, as we stated last month, fight the battle over again on such grounds, because they no longer exist. The considerations that influence us ought also to influence the Gambia merchants on this point. We insist the more on this because we have heard that merchants not connected with the Gambia trade have been active in tendering their co-operation and support to the Gambia merchants in opposing the Government on these Imperial grounds. They have real or fancied interests of their own involved, no doubt, in the projected exchange of settlements; but their interests are not in any respect the interests of the Gambia merchants, who will do wisely to leave them to pull their own chestnuts out of the fire, if they have any that seem likely to be burned there; and decline the proffered aid which, if accepted, will weaken instead of strengthen their position. Their true policy seems to us very clear. It is that they should not oppose the Government views, which are supposed to be now based on Imperial considerations of sufficient weight to justify the Government in entertaining them. Their acquiescence or non-acquiescence will not eventually influence the Government decision. What they have a just right to ask, and should energetically and persistently ask, is that they should not be sacrificed to those Imperial considerations which may justify Her Majesty’s Government in exchanging the Gambia for the relinquishment by the French in favour of Great Britain of their settlements and interests on all other parts of the West Coast of Africa. The Gambia merchants have invested large sums in buildings and other immovable property, in the belief, which they were in every respect justified in entertaining, that the British settlement on the Gambia was a permanent one. The giving up by Great Britain of any settlement it has once formed is an event so extremely rare that there could not be any possible reason why the future cession of the Gambia to some other Power should have been at all contemplated or considered by them. There is not anything therefore in their position at the Gambia to diminish the force and justice of their claim, that in any arrangements made by the British Government with that of the French for the cession of the Gambia to the latter, their interests should be scrupulously guarded and preserved to the fullest extent of their pecuniary value. We have no doubt it is tolerably correct that it would be impossible for them to live and continue their trade at the Gambia as hitherto, when French authorities and laws shall have superseded those under whom and which they have hitherto lived and carried on their commerce. The cession of the Gambia to the French involves therefore their eventual ejection from the settlement. If they remain there striving against the new and adverse circumstances after the cession, and those circumstances act so prejudicially to their interests as they seem to us to be fully justified in believing that they will act, they might be forced into parting with their properties to French merchants at almost any price that the latter might choose to give. They are justified therefore in demanding of Her Majesty’s Government that they shall not be subject to any such contingency, but be so placed under the new rule and laws that, should the prejudicial results which they fear really follow, they may be able at any time to leave the Gambia and receive the full present value of their properties. It is not necessary for us to point out to such practical men as they are how this might be arranged for without any actual loss or burthen to the French Government. It might certainly be so arranged that should the change result adversely to them they shall receive the full present value of their properties; while at the same time they should be left free to realize as much more for these as they might be enabled to obtain.

We may here add that this extensive culture of the ground-nut along the coast has mainly contributed to the extinction of the African slave trade.

These farmers, we must inform your lordship, are principally natives from the interior, who, in consequence of there being no roads for the conveyance of such bulky produce, come down to the banks of the river to cultivate, and remain three or four years; at the end of that period they generally return to their own country with their earnings.\n\nThese factories in the river are in charge of native traders (our servants), men without any capital of their own, and the system of the trade is such that they are obliged to keep current accounts with the farmers and others engaged in collecting the produce running over several years, and we are firmly convinced that we shall lose not only the amount of the actual debts which may be owing to us at these factories, but that the natives from their experience of the French rule in the Senegal and the Cazamanze, will retire from the banks of the river, and it will take years to restore confidence and the trade to its present state.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-07-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Against the Cession of Gambia to the French', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty in Council._\n\nThe humble petition of the undersigned inhabitants of the settlements on the Gambia,\n\nSheweth,—\n\nThat your Majesty's petitioners are your Majesty's most loyal subjects, residing in the settlements on the River Gambia.\n\nThat your Majesty's petitioners, on being informed that negotiations were carrying on between your Majesty's Government and the French Government for the abandonment of the settlements on the Gambia to the latter, without the consent of your Majesty's loyal subjects, felt that they could not be silent and sit quietly whilst such arrangements were in making, which would eventually hurl them under a different Government, manners, customs, and institutions.

Those words, as reported, were that the transfer of the Gambia to France was one of the things under consideration with the object of determining the limits of English and French influence on the West Coast of Africa. Now we will do the British Government the justice to admit that the idea of a cession of the Gambia to France did not originate with them. It was a French idea, born of a French desire for French colonial extension, has been persistently adhered to during many years, has been the instigator of a very tortuous West African policy with the object of ultimately realising it, and was at first put forward by France with the Government of Great Britain, with some such excuse or subterfuge as that enunciated by Mr. Monsell. To obtain the cession of the Gambia from Great Britain has been the sole aim of French policy in all that the French have done or attempted during many years on the West Coast of Africa south of the Senegal. Of course it was ridiculous to suppose that the Gambia would be ceded for nothing. The proposal to Great Britain to make such a cession upon such conditions would have been an insult. France must have something to offer in exchange. She therefore set about acquiring. Manifestly the best possession, or real or pretended claims to acquire, would be some in proximity to British settlements, or in which British subjects seemed to take interest. Thus she found the small settlements of Grand Bassam and Assinee, in immediate proximity to the Gold Coast Protectorate. Then British traders had begun to manifest great interest in the Gaboon. France planted herself there, and Britain acquiesced. The Liverpool merchants, however, made some stir about it. In French eyes the coveted fruit seemed to be ripening, and the proposal was made to the British Government by that of France to transfer Grand Bassam, Assinee, and the Gaboon to Great Britain in exchange for the Gambia, which was from that time forward to be the southern limit of French action. The abandonment of our colonies and settlements abroad had not then, however, been elevated to the rank of a policy. Lord Palmerston, moreover, had formed just and great ideas of the future importance and value of African settlements. He remained always true to Africa, and the paltry offer of the Gaboon, Grand Bassam, and Assinee for one of the finest rivers of Africa, situate only a few days by steamer from England, was allowed quietly to sleep. France saw she had no sufficient inducement to offer, and set to work de novo. Soon after we had annexed Lagos in order formally to extinguish the slave trade there, she endeavoured to establish herself in the disagreeable proximity of Porto Novo. From this, however, she found it necessary to recede, the step was rather too bold a one, it was too much like putting a knife to the throat and demanding surrender. Then commenced the admirable policy of surrounding the Gambia and compromising the future of Sierra Leone by a network of French influence in the numerous rivers south of the Gambia, up to and in the immediate vicinity of Sierra Leone, rivers some of which were great feeders of Sierra Leone trade. She had ample opportunity for doing this, because, although the policy of colonial abandonment was not yet in the ascendant, that of abstention from further acquisition, its family predecessor, had been fully acquiesced in by the magnates of the British political world. France was allowed quietly to establish herself by means of naval expeditions, sent to redress the concerted grievances of French traders in most of the rivers of the great watershed south of the Gambia, of which the Rio Nunez and Rio Pongas are of no mean worth. Great Britain, however, under the influence of the new abstention ideas, attached no importance to this—these were only African rivers—and nothing in West Africa was worthy of her high consideration; everything connected with West Africa was becoming an official bore; the people in the various settlements, notwithstanding their sable hue, were becoming educated through missionary zeal, and they dared to complain of the constant succession of official scum and filth that Downing-street persistently forced down their throats, to their great discomfort and injury; to the squandering of their resources and other shameful inflictions. So France went on in her ingenious policy. Sierra Leone traders were developing an important ground-nut trade in the rivers Mellicourie, Sarries, &c., natural feeders of the Sierra Leone trade.

After the conclusion of the war these settlements were restored to the French, but it was stipulated and agreed that the British merchants who had in the meantime settled there might remain and carry on the trade on an equal footing with French subjects and this arrangement was guaranteed by treaty. These merchants and British subjects soon found themselves, however, so hampered and interfered with, that they were glad to leave those places at a great sacrifice of property, and found a new home for themselves in the Gambia, where many of their descendants still are carrying on the trade. Your lordship will here find that facts are opposed to the theory that British commerce can flourish under the French flag.\n\nWe have also other instances equally striking and within our personal knowledge, and at a heavy cost to us, of the way in which British traders and British commerce have been driven out by the French in the Rivers Cazamanze and Rio Nunez, where for many years previously to the French establishing themselves we carried on a large and profitable English trade, which is now entirely extinct, and the same may be said with truth of the Rivers Saloom and Laine contiguous to the Gambia. With this experience before us, is it surprising that we should look forward with feelings of dismay to the French occupation of the Gambia, however specious the arguments in favour of the cession and great the inducements held out to us of increased protection and diminished taxation under the French rule may be? It is extremely difficult for us to define with exactness the precise pecuniary losses which this proposed cession will inevitably cause to us and all other native British traders in the Gambia, but nevertheless we will endeavour to convey to your mind in a general way at present (reserving to ourselves the right to give your lordship statistical statements hereafter) the enormous sacrifices we shall be compelled to make.

From this point the road goes to Kuniacarry, the frontier town of Bamburra, and thence to Sego.

Thus the only available route for British trade is that already mentioned—from Yarburtenda, on the south bank of the Gambia, via Jellacotta.

Meanwhile, The African Times articles highlight the economic influence of British companies such as the African Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, actively engaged in trade with Africa's West Coast. They mention the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce's concerns about German annexation of African ports, indicating economic favoritism and competition among European powers. The development of trade in commodities like palm oil reflects Africa's integration into the global economy, and the efforts of companies like the African Lakes Company to trade without spirits suggest an imposition of British commercial practices.

On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.755, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': ""market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in Africa was the ideological reflection of her worldwide hegemony, of those 'halcyon days' in which Britain's manufactures outcompeted those of all her rivals and her navy could enforce 'a freedom of access to the markets of the world unparalleled before or since.'$^{48}$ Britain's traders triumphed over all their competitors: over the Boers in southern Africa,$^{49}$ over the African merchants in West Africa,$^{50}$ over the French. 51 second partner in Atlantic trade, the African, if he did not play a decisive role, was nonetheless an actor in it, adapted himself, and extracted profit from the market, in short, behaved like a responsible party in the affair.'"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.774, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Conquest and new production relations, i88o-¿\\ 1910', 'content': ""The most decisive variable affecting the implanting of the colonial economy was the extent to which various parts of Africa had already been participating in the world economy.

Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

A second was Cuba and Brazil, which continued through most of the nineteenth century to obtain slaves from the still permitted trade 'south of the line', where the economies of the slave trade remained different, as we indicated above. 44 The nineteenth century up to Partition was, it has been argued, the era of 'informal empire' or the 'imperialism of free trade'.

Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

Experiences in East Africa underscored the premise that colonial activities first centred around parts of Africa which had a prior involvement in inter› continental exchange. The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region. By the mid 1880s, the Scramble was already taking place on Lake Victoria, on whose shores colonial enterprises were quickly grafted on to the already high level of African economic activity. When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form. North African economies were as much part of a Mediterranean complex as they were part of the African trans-Saharan network. Prior experience with the European economy allowed segments of North African society to accommodate to the intensifi› cation of production for Europe and to the spread of European commodities in local markets. But the well-defined and exploitative ruling class was determined to defend state frontiers, even if willing to enter closer economic relations with Europeans. Therefore, colonial rule often advanced while maintaining North Africans in nominal authority, and the colonial economy was institutionalized before the complete subjugation of the indigenous polities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""The great transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world did not occur with the late nineteenth-century partition by European powers. Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'European trading influence spread much more quickly and more widely than missionary influence in the first half of the nineteenth century. This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

This allowed Southern African capital to grow to massive proportions; and it speeded up monopolization among the West African commercial firms, enabling them to support, and integrate with manufacturing and distributing enterprises in Europe.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

But what precisely was the link? I. Hrbek remarked some time ago on the importance of the years 1805-20 in African history. He observed the simultaneity of the following events: the Western Sudanese djihad of \'Uthman dan Fodio (Usman dan Fodio) (and other Islamic revolutions), the rise of the Zulu under Shaka, the eclipse of Bunyoro and the rise of Buganda in the interlacustrine region, the Fulbe (Fulani, Peul) revolutions in the Western Sudan, the modernizing regime of Muhammad \'AIT in Egypt, the unification of the Imerina on Madagascar under Radama I, and the rise of Omani hegemony under Sayyid Said.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.737, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': 'African resistance helped substantially to dictate a slow pace of economic colonization for at least the three decades between 1880 and 1910. Besides, immediate interest on the part of European monopoly capital was low. Africa commanded high priority during the mercantilist era of accumulation, but the relative obscurity of the nineteenth century persisted into the early years of colonialism, in spite of the increase in politico-economic control which followed upon partition and conquest. Viewed in terms of the global investment drive of monopoly capitalism up to the First World War, figures concerning the growth of the African colonial economy are unimpressive. The most relevant of these figures concerned imports and exports, since the import/export sector was the central feature of the colonial economy. The volume of goods imported into Africa rose sluggishly. With the exception of South Africa, import lists were not headed by machinery, plant or high-quality consumer items. Trade growth usually meant the extension of product lines characteristic of the mid nineteenth century, and those had not departed radically from the patterns of the slave trade era. Cotton piece-goods continued to dominate European exchanges with Africa, and in many places the import of cotton cloth never lost its priority throughout the period in question, although other items of domestic consumption, such as kitchen utensils, radios, bicycles and sewing machines were later to gain in popularity.\nProduction of export commodities within Africa advanced slowly and not always steadily. Natural rubber, for instance, enjoyed only a momentary prominence in West Africa during the 1880s. In East and Central Africa, the more substantial rubber industry fell into decay after an international crisis of prices in 1912-13; so that eventually only Liberia came to be identified with a product which was once highly touted by Europeans bent on the exploitation of Africa. The more usual performance graph of African staples in the colonial context comprised a first stage of insignificant quantities covering two decades of the present century, followed by a second stage of appreciable growth until 1930.

Still, the dread of the knife is so keen, even among the bravest men, that its use is on all occasions regarded with something of distrust. Progress in medicine is, happily, yearly reducing the necessity of this extreme operation, and people are not without hope that it may soon be almost entirely abolished. In a number of cases in which amputation would have been necessary, the use of the knife appears to have been recently avoided merely by the use of a purely vegetable ointment. This composition, distinguished as the ""Lion,"" and prepared by Mr. E. BURGESS, of High Holborn, has won golden opinions from all sorts and conditions of men as a remedy for most skin diseases, old and poisoned wounds, cancers, tumours, ulcers, and other affections. Introduced to the public quietly, and without flourish of trumpets or bold advertisement, it has won wide popular favour, judging from a long list of testimonials now before me, by sheer force of its wonderful curative virtues. Instances innumerable are forthcoming of the almost magical disappearance of diseases of the character I have indicated upon the application of this ointment, and in cases, too, where the treatment of celebrated specialists had entirely failed. To residents in the up-country districts of the colonies, where, under any circumstances, medical aid can only be secured with difficulty, the possession of such an ointment is of the highest value and importance, while the fact that it is a well-approved remedy for stings and venomous bites must strongly recommend it to such of my readers as dwell in India and the tropics.""\n\nOf all Chemists, or through any Wholesale House in England.\n\n---'}, {'id': 6853, 'article_title': 'Liverpool and the African Trade', 'full_section_title': 'Liverpool and the African Trade', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-6', 'issue_date': '05_05_1897', 'content': '## Established 1754.\n\n### BLACKWELL & CO.,\n\n**Printers\' Ink, Colours & Varnish MANUFACTURERS,**  \n7 DYER\'S BUILDINGS, HOLBORN, LONDON, E.C.\n\nB. & Co. have supplied the London ""TIMES"" for more than a Century.\n\n---'}]","[{'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Mr. H. H. Johnston's address on British West Africa and the Trade of the Interior merits thoughtful attention. He starts with the proposition that Englishmen generally have not sufficient thought of the importance of our possessions on the West Coast; and still less of their possibilities. But he reminded his hearers that British West Africa is not a field for Anglo-Saxon colonisation. While there are tracts in the interior, where Europeans could lead happy and healthy lives, the west in general is a land of negroes. The mass of the population must always be of the negro race. Through the use of proper means Mr. Johnston is convinced the native race can be civilised and rendered industrious to a very satisfactory extent. Mr. Johnston's theory is that England should enlarge its borders to the utmost. British trade is the lever he proposes for the enlightenment of the black race. The more the territory which is acquired the more can that influence be exerted. With British trade the appliances of European civilisation are bound to advance.\n\nThey will fast educate the negro both morally and intellectually. Only a condition is that the sway of the Queen's sceptre be acknowledged. Without that there will be no opening for British trade, or for the advantages which follow in its train. Wherever the British flag does not fly in the west of Africa other European flags speedily will. It is now or never for the extension of British commerce and for the guidance of negro progress after British methods: the supremacy of foreign European States signifies the suppression of British trade within."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS COMMISSIONERSHIP', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home. With every trading colony of any size—that is to say, where there are more than three or four trading houses—there is a medical officer, jointly paid by the various firms.\n\nPerhaps in no body of Englishmen abroad has such an improvement taken place as in the class of men who now conduct the trade with the natives in West Africa. In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa. Yearly the improvement continues; more and more the great trading companies of Liverpool and Bristol have realised that their interests are better served by men of good manners and refinement.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH AUTHORITY AND COMMERCE IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce recently presented to the members of the Chamber the draft of a memorial to the Foreign Office respecting the extension of the British protectorate on the coast of Guinea. The memorial pointed out that the occupations by France and the late annexations by Germany of small portions of the West Coast of Africa tended to break the continuity of the British protectorate, and to bring about a greater conflict of national interests. The influence of the British authorities with the natives was lessened, and the introduction of different principles of trading seriously affected the prosperity of British trades. The duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnished the greater portion of the Government revenues. In German and French settlements these articles were free from duty, and being to a great extent sold in the same markets as the British goods, competition became so keen that the loss to British revenue and trade must ultimately be very great. The Committee recommended that the Chamber should ask the Foreign Office that while negotiations regarding African territories were pending, something might be done, by exchange or otherwise, to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from the ports where British trade had become established, and where rivalry upon different commercial and political principles was so injurious. The Government might also take into consideration the extension of the British protectorate to the unoccupied portions of the coast alluded to. It was moved that the Chamber should forward to the Foreign Office a memorial on the lines of that submitted by the African Trade Section. This resolution was unanimously agreed to. At the same meeting a letter was read which had been received from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, asking the Liverpool Chamber to join in a petition to Lord Granville respecting the claims of Portugal on the Congo. The petition stated that authentic information had been received that Portugal was again bringing forward its former pretensions to hold and exercise authority over both banks of the Congo and the adjacent territories, and pointed out the necessity of immediate and effectual steps being taken to secure the renunciation, on the part of Portugal, of any attempt to interfere with the rights of British traders and with the jurisdiction on either side of the Congo and on the adjacent territory.

Whilst instructing the Negro in the development of the resources of his country and inducing him to abjure his insensate religious rites and superstitions, and in compelling the quarrelsome and vindictive savages to turn their swords into ploughshares and their spears into sickles, we shall confer benefits on the inhabitants of Western Africa and derive great profit for our own commercial enterprise. But if we decline to develop and explore those parts of tropical Africa which are within the sphere of our influence, other European nations will not be behindhand in supplanting us. If Free Trade were an established principle with all nations, it would matter little to our traders which Power controlled the new marts for our commerce; but, inasmuch as the first effort of every other European nation is to shut out British enterprise and competition, it is a matter of serious import into whose hands each unoccupied district of Africa is to fall. How much British trade exists in the French Empire of Senegambia? Is not our commerce confined to an infinitesimal amount? Has our commerce attained the same development in Portuguese Africa as it would had those regions been governed by a Power who gave a fair field to all traders?\n\nThe geography of Western Africa is comparatively simple.

It is now announced that the British Government will recommend Parliament to grant a subsidy to a contractor who is prepared to lay and work a cable between St. Vincent and the chief places on the West Coast. We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL COMPANIES FOR AFRICAN TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""But we felt that such great results as these—results of such vital importance to England, as well as for Africa—would be indefinitely postponed, if a mere peddling and irregular trade only was established there. And this would have been the sure result of working with inadequate capital. Money makes money. Nowhere is this more true than in Africa. Africa has given good crops to the little silver sickles that have been thrust into her rich fields of produce. But to reap her great harvests, she wants what has been wanted everywhere for the like purpose—a heavy golden scythe, that shall mow down her abundant crops. Unless we are greatly mistaken, we have obtained this for the Niger and Chadda and other rich districts in the Company of African Merchants. We look to India—the East Indies—and contemplate what a rich and powerful company did there for a land and people torn in pieces by intestine feuds, and poor in the midst of wealth. The past of other countries has been preparing the future of that Africa which has been for centuries engaged in aiming incessant blows within herself at the very principle of vitality in nations—at the very foundation of all territorial wealth—the human life with which she so abounded. Africa may be said to have done nothing as regards her own future benefit, save to make universal and incessant efforts to retard and to prevent it. She has not laboured at all to build up the structure of her future greatness. She might have done so, had not the Christian nations of Europe assisted the followers of Mahomet in setting every man's hand against his brother for gain, throughout the whole length and breadth of the continent. Thenceforward she became an active agent in her own debasement. And well she has laboured in the work, gathering continually harvests of misery and woe. British repentance, first ardently preached by Clarkson, Buxton, Wilberforce, and kindred spirits, terminated the long era of her continuously-advancing degradation. A new one commenced. Under it progress has been slow, but constant.

It had its ups and downs, its days of small things and its successes, but it can boast steady development through all. Twenty-five Europeans are dotted about at trading stations stretching from Quillimane on the coast to a point half-way between the Lakes Nyassa and Tanganyika. These stations are twelve in number, and three steamers ply on lake and river with great regularity. The company has shown itself equal to conveying a steam vessel in sections across from Lake Nyassa, and she is now on Lake Tanganyika with the staff of the London Missionary Society. But the point which the company has settled is this: It has proved that it is possible to trade in India-rubber, wax, oilseeds, and ivory to an enormous amount, without defiling the list of their barter goods with a single keg of trade rum, or the all-representative ""square face"" of the West Coast trade. Messrs. Moir, who are intrusted with the concerns of the company, testify that they have already exported (December, 1885) 40,815lb. of ivory, and not imported a glass of spirits.\n\nLittle short of romantic are some of the incidents connected with the company\'s progress. Two little stunted coffee plants led a miserable existence in the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens. Mr. John Moir took them away with him to the Shire highlands.

It emphasizes the discouragement of industrialization and processing of local raw materials, which turned African states into markets for European manufactured goods while exporting raw materials to Europe. This dependency is further illustrated by the importation of basic goods that could have been produced locally and the lack of diversification in agricultural economies, leaving African states vulnerable to international trade conditions. The exploitative nature of trade practices is noted, where African producers received little for their goods while paying high prices for imports, and colonial infrastructure primarily served the extraction of resources for European benefit. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the significant role of European merchants and companies, such as British and German firms, in African trade, and the influence of European industrial powers like the British Congo Company and the Company of African Merchants. The articles discuss the impact of European infrastructure, such as steamers and railways, on facilitating trade and the introduction of European financial systems, like the African Banking Corporation, which encouraged monetary transactions over barter. While the articles illustrate the dependency of African economies on European goods, services, and infrastructure, they do not explicitly mention the negative consequences of this dependency, such as potential exploitation or economic imbalance, which could be an interesting area for further exploration.

Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans. For the same reason, Africa was also prevented from developing direct trading links with other parts of the world such as India and China."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'As an eminent economist has pointed out, \'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically. Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

The slaving zones from Senegal to Sierra Leone, from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Nigeria and from the Congo river to Angola were the stretches of coast› line first encroached upon by the European colonizers. In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves. Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure.

North Africa entered the imperialist epoch when large amounts of capital were invested in the Suez Canal and when loans were thrust upon the ruling class from Egypt to Morocco.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area. This production at first co-existed with the slave trade,$^{14}$ and later flourished on its own, until the boom came to an end in 1861, and finally declined at the end of the century.$^{15}$ The palm-oil trade similarly expanded in the Gold He finds the relevant consideration to be Europe's need of raw materials and points out the 'extraordinary demands on production' involved in the new amounts of palm oil, timber, and rubber exported.

The colonizers had to supplant the Arab, Swahili and Indian merchants. Experiences in East Africa underscored the premise that colonial activities first centred around parts of Africa which had a prior involvement in inter› continental exchange. The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region. By the mid 1880s, the Scramble was already taking place on Lake Victoria, on whose shores colonial enterprises were quickly grafted on to the already high level of African economic activity. When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form. North African economies were as much part of a Mediterranean complex as they were part of the African trans-Saharan network. Prior experience with the European economy allowed segments of North African society to accommodate to the intensifi› cation of production for Europe and to the spread of European commodities in local markets. But the well-defined and exploitative ruling class was determined to defend state frontiers, even if willing to enter closer economic relations with Europeans. Therefore, colonial rule often advanced while maintaining North Africans in nominal authority, and the colonial economy was institutionalized before the complete subjugation of the indigenous polities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'The European trade was expanding rapidly.$^{11}$ However, this expansion was made possible by and was dependent upon the pre-existing patterns of local and regional trade. A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.724, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

When such 'adjustment' could be said to have occurred to a significant degree - 1650, 1700, 1750 is hard to say, although I tend to feel a later date is more plausible than an earlier one.$^{5}$ What is true, as we shall argue, is that the very shift of slave-trading from a 'luxury' to an 'essential' trade undermined its economic viability, since it meant that the costs of reproduction had thereupon to be included in the overall profitability calculations of the remuneration of labour services in the capitalist world-economy, since, in all 'essential' trade, production costs include 'opportunity costs'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants. African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 572, 'article_title': 'Parliamentary Intelligence', 'full_section_title': 'Parliamentary Intelligence', 'last_edit_date': '02-21-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1865#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_03_1865', 'content': ""### SHARES OF AFRICAN COMPANIES.\n\nCompany of African Merchants, 3l. paid . . .

Our troubles with that School have always been very great, as, owing to the amount of gas consumed and the necessity of keeping the School well heated on account of the nude models, its tendency has been to get unbearably hot; and when windows were attempted to be opened the draughts were most dangerous. It is now kept at a pleasant even temperature, and there are no draughts. The reason for this is not difficult to find. The very hot air from the steam-pipes, and the fumes from the gas, are carried off as fast as they are generated; and a continual stream of warm fresh air being supplied, the School is kept comfortable.  \n(Signed) R.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared.

Going back fifty years ago, to 1836, we find no definite statistics for the Gold Coast; while Gambia exported no less than in 1875—£147,000. The exports of Sierra Leone, on the other hand, were valued at only £71,900. A large share of the West African trade is with Great Britain. In 1884, of the total exports, about £1,100,000, or nearly two-thirds, were sent to the Mother Country, while British produce counted for £93,000 among the imports into the West African Settlements, just more than one-half. Next to England, Germany seems to do the largest trade with these colonies. Indeed, in two of the colonies Germany seems to hold a higher place in exports than the Mother Country. In 1884, exports to the value of £283,500 were sent from Lagos to Germany, while only £249,000 in value were sent to Great Britain, according to local returns. The entire exports to foreign countries in 1884 amounted to £324,620. The imports from Great Britain were nearly double those from foreign countries. We find a somewhat similar state of things on the Gambia, in 1883. The exports to Great Britain were valued at £46,232; to foreign countries £160,487. The imports from the United Kingdom in the same year amounted to £90,000, from British colonies £37,000, and from foreign countries £71,680.\n\nIn all the West African colonies, except the Gambia, palm oil and palm kernels figure as the staple exports. The great exports from Gambia at the present time are ground nuts, which are largely used for the manufacture of French salad oil; these, with bees-wax, rubber, and hides, are now almost the only exports. In the exports for 1883 we find no mention of ground nuts, the chief exports of that date being wax, gum, ivory, gold, and rice. In 1836 the export of ground nuts was valued at only £838, and in 1852 had reached £153,000, in 1882 £230,000, falling to £170,000 in 1883. In 1836 four leading articles of export, gold, gum, ivory, and teak wood, were valued at £45,000, and twenty years later had sunk to £632. That these and other resources of the colonies, especially rubber, are capable of considerable development is maintained by those acquainted with the colony. The value of the rubber exported is about £6,000 annually. Nearly three-fourths of the ground nuts exported go to France.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL COMPANIES FOR AFRICAN TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It will be annihilated by an European desire for legitimate commercial advantage. Human interest, resting in Europe upon the strong fulcrum of human wants, is the mighty lever that God has clearly ordained for lifting the great continent of Africa to the position she has been endowed for. She has passed rapidly, though it may seem to have been slowly, through the earlier stages of her elevation. The epoch of more potent effort has now arrived. Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it. Just as powerful European organizations prosecuted the slave-trade in Africa which individual cupidity desultorily commenced, and thus gave to that accursed traffic the enormous development to which it attained, so will powerful European organizations now take the field in giving development to that legitimate commerce for which Africa possesses so many rich and copious elements. A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array. Companies with too restricted capital can only do the same sort of work that individual merchants have been and are performing. This was and is useful enough for Africa, and beneficial to the merchant, as far as it can prudently go. But Africa now wants more than this. She wants powerful companies, that shall prudently but boldly stimulate and assist her to a much higher and more extensive industrial development. The Company of African Merchants is, and is intended to be, such an one. That it will open to England the great national storehouses of African cotton, we have no doubt; while it will be at the same time be helping forward and reaping other portions of its harvests in the long-opened fields of oils, gums, and other such articles of African produce. We long to see it, and we hope that we shall see it and kindred efficient organizations, take hold of certain richly-endowed districts of Africa with a firm and solid grasp—with a determination to squeeze from them their abundant natural stores, enriching them and elevating them morally and socially in the process—with a firm resolve to employ all those wealth-creating means which advancing civilization in Europe has gradually discovered and applied for stimulating industry and diffusing wealth, comfort, peace, and happiness, among mankind.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The actual value of imports into the Oil Rivers is not easily ascertained. For a period of three years ending 1889 they were estimated to have been £730,000 per annum, but prices have since advanced and the volume of business has considerably increased. The value of exports from the Oil Rivers in 1890 is estimated at considerably over £1,300,000, after adding freight and charges. For four months of the year prices ranged a little over the average, and they promise so far to be fully as high in 1891. The following details as to the principal exports may be of interest. Palm oil has long been the staple export of this part of Africa. According to Porter (“Progress of the Nation”) the import into the United Kingdom in 1808 was 200 tons; 1836, 13,850 tons; 1844, 20,732 tons. It is now (1890) 43,696 tons. These figures, however, are for the United Kingdom only. Formerly the whole went to the British Isles, but now some 8,000 to 10,000 tons annually go to Marseilles, Havre, and Antwerp direct from the Oil Rivers. Of the United Kingdom import, only about 25,000 tons were actually from the Oil Rivers, the balance being from the Niger and Congo, Cameroons, Lagos, and other West African Ports. Palm kernels are rapidly increasing in importance. About 20,000 tons annually go from the rivers to Continental ports alone, and about the same quantity to the United Kingdom. The growing importance of the trade is shown by the fact that the Oil Rivers kernel imports into the United Kingdom only commenced about the year 1860, and in most of the rivers no kernels at all had been shipped before 1875.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS COMMISSIONERSHIP', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

J. Irvine & Co.'s Palm Oil Report for November"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that has just expired has witnessed the continuance and, indeed, the aggravation of that painful depression in the trade of West Africa which existed in 1886. The average prices in Europe of the more important native products have stood even lower than during the previous twelve months, while the prolonged continuance of low prices in Africa has apparently disheartened the native producer, and tended to diminish the quantity as well as the value of his out-turn. In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos. Great numbers of clerks and artisans, anxious for engagements as heretofore at various parts of the coast, are unable to obtain employment, or only at reduced rates of wages.\n\nTo these communities 1888 will probably bring good tidings. It has been stated, on apparently good authority, that early in the new year the so-called ""oil rivers""—now under intermittent Consular jurisdiction—will be formed into a Colony. The experiences of Lagos and the Gold Coast enable us to predict, with tolerable certainty, the results which will follow from this policy. These valuable regions will be rapidly settled and opened up to trade. Hitherto, owing to the prevalence of the barter system, the unsettled condition of the tribes, and the absence of order and justice, only wealthy European houses have been able to make the necessary provisions.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1888#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The average prices in Europe of the more important native products have stood even lower than during the previous twelve months, while the prolonged continuance of low prices in Africa has apparently disheartened the native producer, and tended to diminish the quantity as well as the value of his out-turn. In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos. Great numbers of clerks and artisans, anxious for engagements as heretofore at various parts of the coast, are unable to obtain employment, or only at reduced rates of wages.\n\nTo these communities 1888 will probably bring good tidings. It has been stated, on apparently good authority, that early in the new year the so-called ""oil rivers""—now under intermittent Consular jurisdiction—will be formed into a Colony. The experiences of Lagos and the Gold Coast enable us to predict, with tolerable certainty, the results which will follow from this policy. These valuable regions will be rapidly settled and opened up to trade. Hitherto, owing to the prevalence of the barter system, the unsettled condition of the tribes, and the absence of order and justice, only wealthy European houses have been able to make the necessary provisions.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1888#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Decade of the Trade of Hamburg with West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'An interesting report from the British Consul-General at Hamburg on the growth of the trade of that port with the West Coast of Africa during the past ten years has lately been issued. The main features of this increase are the establishment of direct and regular steam communication, a fourfold increase in the shipping, an increase in imports of more than sixfold, while exports have doubled.\n\nIn the imports of Hamburg the West Coast of Africa now ranks fifth, and in exports fourth. First, as to shipping—in 1878, 25 vessels, of which 10 were German, with a total tonnage of 8,054 tons, arrived in Hamburg from the West Coast, and 98 vessels, of which 48 were German, of 25,674 tons left Hamburg, and none were steamers. In 1888 there were 63 vessels inwards, 34 being German, of a gross tonnage of 67,446 tons, and 89 outwards, 59 being German, of a gross tonnage of 72,885 tons. Of the inward vessels 54, and of the outward 59 were steamers. Thus in ten years the tonnage increased by about 400 per cent. Imports have increased far more than exports, because Hamburg has now become the centre of distribution for West African products.\n\nThe chief article of import is palm kernels, of which there were 973,405 cwts. in 1888, against 106,453 cwts. in 1878; in palm oil the quantities for the same years were 121,884 cwts. and 29,036 cwts., respectively; coffee, 11,109 cwts. and 96 cwts.; dyewood, 20,668 cwts. and 6,094 cwts.; india-rubber, 13,679 cwts. and 3,142 cwts.; and so on for less important articles. The total imports for 1888 amounted to 1,168,783 cwts., and the exports 1,121,605 cwts.; in 1878 the imports were 182,399 cwts., and the exports 495,660 cwts. The chief article of export is alcohol in one or other of its forms. The export of spirits in 1888 was 652,130 cwts., against 314,120 cwts. in 1878; the exports of the other principal articles for the two years were as follows: Rice, 90,778 cwts. in 1888 and 5,053 in 1878; beer, 16,479 and 2,919 cwts.; gunpowder, 86,320 and 10,844 cwts.; iron ware, 20,478 and 4,559 cwts.; tobacco, 12,048 and 2,784 cwts.; cotton goods, 11,053 and 3,110 cwts. In the non-European trade of Hamburg, West Africa comes sixth in imports, before Mexico, Singapore, Japan, China, &c., and next after British India. Indeed, it is nearly equal to the latter, which includes considerable imports of jute and rice. In exports the West Coast is fourth, coming next after the Argentine Republic.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The trade between this country and West Africa is capable of almost infinite development. It is now announced that the British Government will recommend Parliament to grant a subsidy to a contractor who is prepared to lay and work a cable between St. Vincent and the chief places on the West Coast. We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Produce Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that has just expired has witnessed the continuance and, indeed, the aggravation of that painful depression in the trade of West Africa which existed in 1886.

There is of late years a growing tendency on the part of the native, even in the remote interior, to employ silver currency for his transactions in place of direct barter or the cumbrous method of transporting vast quantities of cowrie shells from market to market. Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods.
