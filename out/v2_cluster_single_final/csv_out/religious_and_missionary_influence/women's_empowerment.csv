1110,"Mrs. Moseley's establishment of a female school in Cape Coast, supported by both local leaders and the colonial government, marked a significant early effort to promote women's education and empowerment in Africa through Christian principles and social reform.","The claim that Mrs. Moseley's establishment of a female school in Cape Coast marked a significant early effort to promote women's education and empowerment in Africa through Christian principles and social reform is supported by observations from The African Times but not by the General History of Africa textbook. The General History of Africa does not provide specific information about Mrs. Moseley's school or the involvement of local leaders and the colonial government in such an initiative. While it discusses the role of Christian missions in promoting education, including schools for girls, it lacks details about individual efforts like Mrs. Moseley's. In contrast, The African Times articles offer substantial support for the claim, detailing Mrs. Moseley's dedication and the support she received from local leaders, such as chiefs and cabocceers, and the colonial government, represented by figures like Sir Arthur Kennedy and Mr. Usher, who provided financial backing. The articles highlight the broader social reform agenda, emphasizing the importance of educating women to elevate the community's moral and social standards. However, they do not explicitly address the long-term impact or extent of empowerment achieved, which remains an area of interest for historians.

They opened model farms and technical schools. 68 Methodist missionaries, under the leadership of George Maclean, con› centrated their efforts on the western coast, with Cape Coast as a base. Thomas Birch Freeman, a man of great ability, strove tirelessly to found Methodist schools throughout the interior as far as the Asante country and along the coast as far as Yorubaland. 69 Freeman was inspired by the ideals of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade and for the Civilization of Africa, the objectives of which included studying the leading languages and reducing the most important of them to writing; introducing the printing press and local paper manu› facture; investigating the climates of different districts; introducing the science of medicine; building roads and canals for transport and an effective drainage system for the sake of sanitation; sharing with the Africans the most up-to-date agricultural knowledge; providing them with equipment and seed of good quality, and also advising on the best crops to produce for the world market.$^{70}$ Like the Basel Mission, they established model farms in the Cape Coast district. They admitted girls who often numbered up to three out of ten in their schools.$^{71}$ Even more impressively, with a view to removing the language barrier to evangelization, as early as the eighteenth century they had translated the basic works of Christianity into Ga. In 1875 the Reverend J. G. Christaller published a Twi grammar, and his dictionary of the Akan languages, first published in 1881, is still the best available. 72 Despite the efforts of Christianity and Islam in the region, traditional religion continued to command the allegiance of a large majority of the population, and in many instances survived within the new religions as well.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': 'In Southern Africa, even greater attention was paid to education than in other parts of Africa, thanks partly to the grants-in-aid that were given by the governments of the Cape and Natal during the period. It would appear that the educational activities of the missionaries had been far more successful than their evangelical activities by 1870.$^{18}$ Not only had many elementary or village schools been established but, from as early as the 1840s, teacher-training and secondary institutions were founded. The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The spread of Christianity, Islam and western education was another important impact of colonialism. There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

The importance of schools for the missionary enterprise was expressed by Elias Shrenk as follows: If we had a nation with formal education, able to read and write, my plans for mission work would be different. But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible. The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

He believed that teachers and preachers in the quantity required by the African population should come from that school, thereby breaking the total reliance for missionary and teaching personnel on overseas schools. In the meantime, Turner visited South Africa in 1898, consecrated Dwane as AME vicar-bishop and pro› claimed the intention of the Church to build an AME College second to none among 'previous missionary educational endeavors'. Dwane, in turn, talked of establishing 'The Turner Normal School at Queenstown' or 'The Wilberforce of the Dark Continent'.\nTurner devoted the entire issue of Voice of Missions for March 1899 to publicity for the South African College Campaign. In one article portray› ing the redemption of Africa as the 'American Negro's Burden', the specifi› cations of the College took shape: it would be a school for Africans, taught by Africans, founded and supported by the AME missionary department. The founding faculty would come from African students already studying at Wilberforce University, Morris Brown College, Howard University, and the Medical Department of Central State College at Nashville, Tennessee.\nThe issue of non-African direction and dominance in the Church move› ment proved, however, unendurable for Dwane. In 1899, he seceded from the AME-'Ethiopian' union and thus created a schism within the ranks of the black Church in South Africa. Trying to retrieve its missionary foothold in South Africa, the AME General Conference in 1900 appointed Levi Coppin as the first Resident Bishop. The Church, moreover, was aided in its work by Charlotte Manye, the Sotho student who had triggered the AME-Ethiopian affiliation in the first place. Manye returned from her American studies in 1901 and immediately picked up the South African College idea - by founding an AME mission school among the Pedi in the Eastern Cape. By 1908, Charlotte Manye Maxeke and her spouse had obtained enough money from the Missionary Department to buy land in Transvaal, build a hall (named after Bishop Coppin) and to move the school (now named Wilberforce Institution) to its permanent location at Evaton."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Both the new elite and the urban proletariat were important as agents making for change in rural colonial society, but the former were indis› putably the more important in the political, economic and social history of colonial Africa.

The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education. Literacy was for many African peoples a new magic, and was sought after as such and at all costs since it appeared to open the treasure house of the modern world. To know the amount of power, authority and influence which the first generation of African clerks, interpreters and teachers exercised is to have some idea of the spell which literacy cast over many African peoples.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Another highly regrettable social impact of colonialism was the deterior› ation that it caused in the status of the woman in Africa.

Moreover, many African rulers had been able to build empires of varying size only a couple of decades back, and some were still in the process of expanding or reviving their kingdoms. Many of them had been able to defend their sovereignties with the support of their people using traditional weapons and tactics. Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria. As seen above, Menelik addressed a similar appeal to the same monarch as well as to other European heads of state.\nIt is also obvious from some of the quotations above that many African rulers did in fact welcome the new changes that were steadily being intro› duced from the third decade of the nineteenth century since these changes had hitherto posed no threat to their sovereignty and independence. In West Africa, for instance, thanks to the activities of the missionaries, Fourah Bay College had been founded as early as 1827 in Sierra Leone, while elementary schools and a secondary school each in the Gold Coast and Nigeria had been established by the 1870s. Indeed, a call for the establish› ment of a university in West Africa by the Caribbean-born pan-Africanist, Edward Wilmot Blyden had already gone out. As early as 1887 some of the wealthy Africans had even begun to send their children to Europe for further education and professional training and some of them had returned to the Gold Coast as fully qualified barristers and doctors.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': ""Moreover, in West Africa as to some extent in the Portuguese areas of Mozambique and Angola, while some members of the educated elite entered the professions as civil servants, teachers, catechists, ministers and church agents - by 1885 according to the latest account, the Wesleyans had 15 African ministers, 43 catechists, 259 preachers and 79 teachers in the Gold Coast32 - the majority entered the commercial field as independent traders and operated on credit provided by the foreign companies and resident traders. It was the latter, described as the 'aspirant bourgeoisie' by Susan Kaplow,33 who, as will be seen later, pushed the frontiers of retail trade in the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Nigeria further and further inland during the period under review. As one report from the Gold Coast put it, by 1850, the young men had gone to reside in the interior as traders and clerks and it was they who were 'causing a great increase in the consumption of the manufactures ofGreat Britain and are widely extending commerce and civilisation amongst the native population'.34 Similar social developments took place in Madagascar and in Central and East Africa. Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'African traditional religion and colonial rule', 'content': ""What missionaries found particularly abhorrent was female initiation, and they vehemently spoke against it, and the Church of Scotland Mission, African Inland Church, and Gospel Missionary Society prohibited it in their churches in 1920 and 1921. Boys' circumcision among Christians was not as severely interfered with, but the missions required that it should be done in hospitals or private homes. As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end. But the Africans felt that both male and female initiation served a profoundly meaningful purpose in their communal life and that any sudden abolition or prohibition would greatly disrupt their psycho› logical, social and religious security.\nThe African opposition to the negative attitude towards female circum› cision came into the open in the early 1920s, beginning in 1923. For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue. In 1929 a dance song, called muthirigu, which ridiculed missions and Christians who were opposed to female initiation, spread quickly among the Gikuyu but was banned by the British colonial administration the following year. Furthermore African opposition ex› pressed itself in the secession of many members from the Protestant and Anglican churches among the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru peoples. An independent Church, the African Orthodox Church, arose in 1928, while in 1930 a prophetic movement sprang up among the Gikuyu, preaching God's impending judgement upon Europeans and missions, but was quickly banned by the colonial administration.\nAfrican protest continued to express itself in many forms, including disturbances, attacks on mission schools, attempts to prevent preachers from conducting services, and even the murder of a missionary at Kijabe. Combined with the African protest against the missionary attitude to female circumcision was also a growing nationalism which eventually resulted in political resistance against foreign rule.

Of these, 'over seven hundred were in professional occupations, mostly teachers but including also eight law agents, two law clerks, one physician, and two editors or journalists; almost one hundred were clerks and interpreters, about one hundred and seventy artisans and over six hundred labourers and farmers.'$^{23}$ It should not be forgotten that Lovedale was not the only such institution; there were others in the Cape and Natal. Many of the products of these institutions, as will be seen later, were to play a leading role in the mass religious movement among the Bantu in the 1880s and especially the 1890s. Among them were Tiyo Soga, in 1856 the first Xhosa to be ordained a minister of the Free Church of Scotland; Nehemiah Tile, who studied theology at the Healdtown Institution; Reverend Kanyome, a Cape Bantu clergyman; James M.

In 1884, he founded the first Bantu newspaper (Imv0 Zabantsundu) and was to play a prominent role in Cape politics between the 1890s and 1910s. 25 Viewed in relation to the entire black population in South Africa, the number of the Western-educated elite that had emerged by 1880 was exceedingly small. Even smaller was the elite in East and Central Africa by that date.

Aggrey was steered to Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina, the chief educational institution of the AME Zion Church, with the apparent understanding that he would return directly to Africa in the service of the Church. Upon taking a baccalaureate and a divinity degree, however, Aggrey accepted employment in the AME Zion publishing house in Charlotte, became correspondent for one or two black newspapers, conducted free classes for black teachers in the vicinity, was ordained a Church elder, and was offered a pastorate by two black churches. According to his biographer, this pastoral work was 'one of the most important incidents in Aggrey's American experiences', because 'it took him out of an academic atmosphere and introduced him to the activities of the life led by the American Negro'.$^{41}$ Moreover, his connections with black America had already been deepened when he married, in 1904, a young Afro-American woman, possibly a descendant of Frederick Douglass. After twenty-two years work in black America, Aggrey returned to Africa on two separate occasions as a member of the Phelps-Stokes Commission, but died in 1927 shortly after accepting the post of assistant vice-principal of the newly created Achimota College in Ghana.

All efforts for changing the condition of the African people must be fruitless where this great element of civilization—an educated female community—is wanting. In another column will be found an appeal by Mrs. Moseley for funds necessary to establish a school for females at Cape Coast. Mrs. Moseley is the widow of a gentleman who, for some short time, until death removed him at once from life and duty, occupied a high official position at Cape Coast. While there with her late husband, Mrs. Moseley obtained the confidence and affection of almost the whole female population of the town. Since her return to this country her efforts have been unceasing to procure some arrangements by which the females of the town of Cape Coast may become so raised in social condition as to insure not only an increase of personal happiness among them, but, through their social influence, a general advancement in Christian civilization. To this great and most interesting work Mrs. Moseley has dedicated her future life. Already beloved by the female population at Cape Coast, she would commence her noble labours with advantages that many ladies might fail to secure, even were other ladies disposed thus to exile themselves from that civilization which must be so dear, in order to labour in such a country as that of Guinea in the cause of humanity and of Him who gave himself a sacrifice for mankind. Many of our efforts on behalf of Africa are possibly misunderstood. About this work of Mrs. Moseley's there cannot, however, be any misapprehension. Every lady who reads our journal ought to interest herself in this movement. It ought, and must, we should think, appeal forcibly to every female heart.

Our deeply interested friends at Cape Coast were informed of this by the mail of the 24th October, although the certainty (D.V.) was arrived at too late to allow of our announcing it in our last month\'s issue. Yet a few days or weeks, and one of the African steamers will be bearing to the West Coast a rich tribute of Christian zeal and womanly sympathy in the person of one who relinquishes all the endearments of family and friends, all the refinements of advanced civilisation, because her heart is overflowing with love and pity for a female population growing up in an ignorance that leads to and perpetuates the deepest social debasement, and burns with a holy desire for their Christian and industrial regeneration. It has been a deep disgrace to Great Britain that her PROTECTORATE of Cape Coast has not hitherto been attended by any Government effort to remove that almost impassable barrier against Christian civilisation that is raised by the continuance of the female population in that debased and degraded state to which they have been consigned from generation to generation. Thank God that disgrace is now about to be removed! He has raised up an instrument admirably fitted for the work; her earnestness has prevailed over official inertion and incredulity; and we have now the full conviction that her noble effort will receive that official protection and aid which, as before stated, we have considered to be indispensable to the permanent establishment in Cape Coast of a Christian industrial female school, wherein the present and future rising generations of African females may be brought under the civilising influences of instruction imparted by zealous and devoted Christian Englishwomen, of whom Mrs. Moseley looks upon herself as the first in time only. For although it may—as we pray and hope that it will—please God greatly to bless and prosper her individual exertions in this great and interesting field of labour, it is of course only a foundation that she will be able to lay. The leaven that is to leaven the whole lump of female degradation within the Cape Coast territories will need to be continually replenished; and the work will be begun in faith that He who has filled the one heart with ardent desire thus to labour in that portion of his vineyard, will fill other hearts from time to time with desire to go and do likewise; even as he has moved that of the present distinguished head of the British Executive on the West Coast, Sir A. E. Kennedy, to a full comprehension of the inestimable value of the effort about to be made by Mrs. Moseley, and to a determination to do all that is in his power, both as Governor-in-Chief and as a Christian gentleman, to protect and further the noble work. We should fail in our duty if we did not here tender to his Excellency our most sincere and warmest thanks; and express our joy that the name of one who has already conferred so many benefits on Africa by his enlightened rule (because he feels what the duty of Great Britain really is on the West Coast) will be written indelibly in African annals as associated with this work and labour of love for the African people. Now that the work is, by God\'s blessing, about to commence, we think it incumbent on us to point out how great an advantage it will offer to many educated African parents in other towns of Cape Coast and the Gold Coast; and, the distance not being great, even in Lagos, so soon as adequate accommodation can be provided for them, Mrs. Moseley will, we believe, consent to receive the daughters of such Africans as can afford to pay for their instruction, although they may not be residents in Cape Coast. A growing want of such a place of education in that part of Africa has long been felt; hitherto such Africans in those parts have had no possibility of obtaining a refined Christian education for their daughters without sending them to England; a course which was attended with great risk, and entails a very heavy expense. In consenting to take upon herself this heavy additional labour, we think we are correct in saying that Mrs. Moseley hopes thereby to raise up a class of African lady teachers, who will be competent to instruct others of their race in those Christian principles, industrial pursuits, and social refinements which must be imparted in the first instance by one so admirably fitted to impart them as Mrs. Moseley undoubtedly is. And we cannot avoid expressing the hope and the conviction that the presence of this lady at Cape Coast will be productive of great good in other ways. It seems to us a matter of much importance that such a nucleus of polished female Christian society should exist, where young African ladies who return from being educated in England may find a congenial society, be surrounded by pure and holy, as well as refined associations and influences, and have a kind and sympathising friend and counsellor, ever ready to aid them in preserving the advantages they have obtained by education in England, and in setting before their African sisters who have not been so favoured an example of Christian purity and Christian love. And in proportion as the number of educated Christian women thus increases, it may be hoped that Christian English officials, having thus a society at command in which their wives would find themselves at home, might be induced to bring them out to add to the charms of that society, and to help in the great work of African social regeneration. The moral atmosphere of the place would thus become, in some degree at least, purified; and we might hope to see a more abundant fruit of the labours of those Christian missionaries who have been endeavouring to inculcate Gospel truths and Gospel principles. It is in the belief that such results may flow from the foundation of Mrs. Moseley\'s Female School, that we have given to her noble and self-devoted efforts all the support in our power, and persevered through evil as well as through good report, until now at last her preliminary efforts have been crowned with success, and the scene of her labours is about to be changed from England to Cape Coast. We were about to add, may God go with her! but we feel assured that he will go with her, and support her until she be rewarded by the blessings of many ""who were ready to perish,"" but have found safety, and peace, and joy.'}, {'id': 1709, 'article_title': 'NOTICES', 'full_section_title': 'NOTICES', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_01_1870#article-12', 'issue_date': '24_01_1870', 'content': ""We regret having been again compelled to postpone the insertion of Fidelis's letter relative to the motives which he alleges induced the merchants and others at the Gambia to bring certain charges against Admiral Patey, though this letter and our leader on the subject were in type early in December.\n\n**MRS.

We cannot possibly imagine how an apprehension that she would make too high a rate of charge can have originated in any one's mind. Mrs. Moseley is not going to Cape Coast to set up a money-making school. She goes, her heart overflowing with Christian charity and love, to rescue the rising female generation from that grievous bondage of ignorance which has perpetuated the degradation of their maternal ancestors and of all the women of the country. It is on this ground that she was justified in looking to the Government for permanent aid in her work. If, as is happily the case, she has consented also to receive some of the daughters of those who might perhaps, but for the advantages her school will afford, have sent their children to England, it is not with the view of any profit to herself, but because she believes that the general benefits conferred by the institution may thereby be very greatly increased. It can scarcely happen but that some of those of the more wealthy class whom she may thus educate, and whose hearts may be brought under the blessed influences of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, will become partakers of Mrs. Moseley's views; be filled like her with ardent desire to introduce the blessing of Christian female education throughout the land; and, imbued with her spirit, become in their turn workers in that great and noble field of Christian effort. Mrs. Moseley's ideas, and those of his Excellency the Governor-General, Sir Arthur Kennedy, are in perfect accord on this subject; and we are sure that Sir Arthur Kennedy will not consider us guilty of any breach of confidence when we say that one of his first questions to us in conversation about it, was in the form of an expression of hope that Mrs. Moseley included this education of a paying class of females in her programme. Our anxious friends need not, therefore, be under any apprehensions that Mrs. Moseley's terms will be such as they will be unable to pay. The annual subvention assigned to be paid from the local revenues, will no doubt be such as will afford Mrs. Moseley the gratification of lightening, as far as possible and advisable, the burden of education for the children of the paying class of natives. We should not have thus noticed the letters written to us but for the reason urged in them, which is, that the disturbed state of the Protected Territories during the last four years has very seriously reduced the means of the commercial class. We know this is unfortunately the case; and we have not therefore attributed their pecuniary anxieties alluded to to an unworthy and grudging spirit. We feel fully convinced that they estimate at its proper value the immense advantages of a judicious Christian education for their daughters; and that when the commercial circumstances of the territories shall improve, as we hope they soon will do, those very persons who are now anxious for a moderate tariff of education for them, will become liberal donors for enabling the precious establishment formed by Mrs. Moseley at Cape Coast to expand so as to meet and satisfy the increasing demand for admission to a share of the inestimable benefits, by the great mass who cannot pay at all.""}, {'id': 1809, 'article_title': 'THE ARRIVAL OF MRS.

Grimmer, that the inauguration of Mrs. Moseley's Cape Coast Christian Female Institution would take place on Thursday evening; and private invitations were sent out to a few of the resident gentlemen and ladies of Cape Coast. The good lady devoted the whole of the day, assisted by Miss Jessie Cruickshanks, in decorating the schoolroom and private residence with flowers, green leaves, and pictures. At half-past five began to enter the rank, wealth, and beauty of Cape Coast—the élite of Cape Coast society were present. The large schoolroom was crowded, and there were seated outside of it a great many people who had no seats within. The Acting Administrator, Mr. S. C.

The chairman then remarked on the object of the meeting, and pointed out most touchingly the deplorable effect of ignorance on a population, and recommended the support of the population to the institution. The Rev. Thomas Maxwell commented on the religious aspect of the subject, and expressed himself warmly on the Christian advantages that will accrue to the rising daughters of Cape Coast by the establishment. He remarked the difference between Mrs. Moseley's institution and others of the kind on the Coast—that whilst the latter are backed by large and influential societies, the other is entirely single-handed. Mr. Charles Bartels was then called upon, and he spoke most feelingly on the degradation of the country, and said that on the female population depends, most assuredly, the civilisation of a country, and recommended most earnestly the support of the school.

With indescribable pain we learned that only two or three days later she was again prostrated with fever and dysentery. This second attack was much stronger than the first, and coming upon a system still further enfeebled by the previous one, her life was in great danger. But God was pleased to bless the extraordinary exertion of Dr. Africanus J. Horton, S.A.S., who not only treated her malady with the highest medical skill, but watched and tended her day and night every hour that he could be spared from his other patients, until she became happily so far recovered that he was able to get her on board the mail steamer for England. To England he intended she should go, considering a residence in a cooler climate to be indispensable to her complete restoration. Before Mrs. Mosely left Cape Coast, Mr. Usher, the Administrator, had assigned 200l. a-year as the Government local subsidy to the school, and Miss Grant, daughter of Mr. F. C. Grant, J.P., of Cape Coast, who had been educated in England, undertook the supervision of the school during Mrs. Moseley's enforced absence. Mrs. Mosely had, therefore, the great relief of knowing that her work was taken care of while she should be seeking health. When the steamer reached Sierra Leone Mrs. Moseley, however, was taken on shore, and received and treated by Sir Arthur Kennedy, C.B., Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, with a hearty and considerate kindness which does him the highest honour. Sir Arthur's anxious desires and earnest advice, as communicated to us by his Excellency by letter, was that Mrs. Mosely, after adequate rest at Government House, should fulfil Dr. Horton's intentions and come on to England. And this was our earnest desire also. But her heart is so set on that great work she has undertaken, that, feeling her strength rapidly increasing, she has, in opposition to Dr. Horton's command, and Sir Arthur's and our desire, elected to return at once to Cape Coast, and we believe will, ere this, have again arrived there. As the rainy reason will have entirely passed, all that is left to us is to hope that she may now find the climate as beneficent as it was previously fatal to her health. Sir Arthur Kennedy has confirmed Mr. Usher's action as regards the grant of 200l. per annum to the school, and if it should please God so to strengthen Mrs. Moseley that she may be able to remain throughout the dry season at Cape Coast, we have every hope that the school will take such deep root as to ensure its future growth and usefulness. The names of Dr. Horton, Sir Arthur Kennedy, and Mr. Usher will now be indelibly associated with that effort to impart instruction to the rising female population of Cape Coast, and to bring them under the influence of those Christian precepts and civilised habits that will fit them to be mothers of Christian civilised families, upon the increase of which the prosperity and happiness of the Gold Coast must very much depend. It is happily impossible for barbarism to be restored to its ancient power, and it therefore becomes more and more necessary to have an educated native population that will co-operate earnestly with the British Administration in the work of public improvement, which we hope will now be pushed forward with prudence and vigour. We beg, in conclusion, to tender our most sincere and heartfelt thanks to Dr. Horton for his devoted attention, to Sir Arthur Kennedy, Mr. Administrator Ussher, and Mr. Rainy, for all they have done for our dear friend's safety and comfort.

It is not, as some have stated (unjustly and unkindly), the want of intellect or the repugnance evinced by the natives to receive assistance and information from those who have so long laboured amongst them, but from the deep-rooted superstition which prevails, inherited from their forefathers, which cannot be at once eradicated from their minds.\n\n""The natives generally are particularly intelligent, very grateful, and anxious to gain information, not addicted to the violent passions and cruelties practised by other unchristian nations. Why, then, should not the great cause of Christian civilization progress in West Africa as in other settlements?\n\n""It is, in my opinion, because the female part of the community are kept in such a degraded state. They are uneducated, and looked upon by the other sex as mere slaves, and treated as such. Their lives are devoted to manual labour, and their persons frequently sold or pawned to supply the pecuniary wants of their owners, instead of being respected and looked up to as equals, and helpmates in Christian and domestic happiness. Until the female population is raised to its proper position, Christian civilization can never arrive at that standard which we are all anxious to witness, and which it is our duty, as followers of Christ, to endeavour to reach.\n\n""Mrs. Moseley, the widow of the much-beloved and respected judge who was stationed at Cape Coast, and greatly esteemed and regretted by all, and especially by the native population, has, I am happy to find, come forward and offered her services in establishing an infant female school at Cape Coast.\n\n""With God\'s assistance, and a person so well qualified as Mrs. Moseley, we may look forward to great results.

It is not likely that there can be any adequate idea among our friends on the West Coast, of the heavy personal sacrifices which such a step on the part of such a lady involves; where cherished family ties must be torn asunder, and so many dear Christian friends be left. We hope, however, they will believe us when we tell them that the sacrifice is a heavy one, and such a one as only an extreme Christian love for the souls of the rising female population of Cape Coast could induce. There are many—alas! too many—fields of Christian labour in England, requiring talents such as those with which Mrs. Mosely is so richly endowed; fields in which great good might be done, and labour in which would not involve any of those painful sacrifices to which we have referred; but all these are passed by because of a great love for the African people, and the conviction that among them is the field of labour to which God has especially called her by the mysterious workings of his providence. We hope that all this will be borne in mind by our readers at Cape Coast; that they will impress this upon those around them, and that there will at least be a hearty endeavour on their part to help by any means in their power, in the work to which this lady has thus devoted herself for the good of that race and that community of which they form a part.

The old Christian sympathies for Africa seem to have made an Arctic voyage and become thoroughly iced. They will thaw some day—of that we have no doubt—and for the most part we endeavor to wait with as good a grace as possible. But there are some things to be done that strike so immediately and directly at the worst of the evils of African society, that to withhold the pecuniary means, when the more precious ones of devoted Christian zeal and self-sacrificing human sympathy are ready for action, is a deplorable neglect of duty. To hope against constant disappointment is difficult, but in one case, at least, we do try to hope that such neglect of duty will not appear. The Cape Coast Female School, for which Mrs. Moseley, widow of a late chief justice of the Supreme Court at the Gold Coast, is seeking the necessary funds, ought to be commenced forthwith. There is no real Christian civilization possible anywhere without a previous release of the female part of the population from those degradations to which they are subject in heathen and barbarous countries. A real civilization must begin with the education and refinement of woman. When at Cape Coast, Mrs. Moseley, whose Christian heart was deeply grieved at the debased condition of the women and the utter neglect of the female children, made some efforts at imparting instruction, which were most gratefully welcomed by the people, and promised to be attended with very beneficial results. The poor creatures saw that a kind and generous heart was interested in their welfare, and they repaid her efforts with a warm and most gratifying tribute of affection. It is impossible to estimate the good that might be effected by the devoted labors of a refined and cultivated Christian lady such as Mrs. Moseley really is. We are sure that, if our readers could see her and hear her plead for the poor people for whose welfare she is ready to give up all the charms of a refined society she is so eminently fitted to adorn, they would feel so powerfully the influence of that sense of Christian duty by which she is actuated to make such sacrifices, that they would soon double the amount now stated to be indispensable to the commencement of the work at Cape Coast. We refer our readers, our lady readers especially, to Mrs. Moseley\'s letter which appears in our third page.

Any further information required on the subject may be obtained by addressing Mrs. Moseley direct.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': ""No less revolutionary and lasting in its impact was the other con› temporaneous religious revolution that was taking place elsewhere in Africa, namely, the Christian missionary revolution. Though attempts at the planting of Christianity in the areas to the south of the Western Sudan reach as far back as the era of the Portuguese explorations in the fifteenth century, there was hardly any trace of the Christian religion left by the turn of the eighteenth century. However, from about the last decade of that century and especially during the first five decades of the nineteenth century, the situation underwent a revolutionary change. Primarily because of the evangelical revival in Europe associated with John Wesley, and the anti-slavery and humanitarian spirit of the age, born out of radical philosophies typified by the American and French revolutions, the attempt to plant and spread Christianity assumed the same dynamic if not militant form that characterized Islamic expansion in the Western Sudan. Here, initially, instead of the Ku'ran and the Sword, the Bible, the plough and commerce were the means resorted to, and the active agents were not djikâd leaders, clerics and their flag-bearers but a host of missionary societies, formed and based in Europe and America, and their African agents in Africa.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland.

It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony. It is signifi› cant that except in North Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar, these languages have remained the official languages even to this very day.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Christianity in the colonial era', 'content': 'The close association of Christianity and education cannot be over› emphasized, for it was through the innumerable schools established by missionaries that many Africans came into contact with Christianity, and in fact school was the church in many parts of Africa. The importance of schools for the missionary enterprise was expressed by Elias Shrenk as follows: If we had a nation with formal education, able to read and write, my plans for mission work would be different. But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible. The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

In North Africa and Egypt, on the other hand, sections of the ruling elite sought to ensure the survival of Islamic culture through the introduction of western science and commerce. Their stand led to a fruitful marriage between Islamic culture and western scientific thought. Because the Western Sudanese Muslims failed to show comparable initiative in this matter, they found themselves unprepared to meet the challenges posed by colonial rule.

They were the very fact of colonial conquest with its attendant political settlement, western education, western Christianity, western economic forces and increased urbanization. Details of how most of these forces - especially those of military conquest, political conquest, consolidation and economic exploita› tion - penetrated Africa and gained a firm grip on her society have been given in other chapters of this volume. It remains to do the same briefly for urbanization and western education before passing on to an analysis of the social effects which all the forces working jointly produced.\nIn dealing with urbanization it is necessary to emphasize that this important force of change was not introduced into Africa by European rule. On the contrary it had been operating there - with all the opportunities it offered for occupational specialization, population aggregation, social mobility and so on - for centuries before the imposition of European colonialism. The coasts of North, East, West and Southern Africa, as well, for example, as inland areas such as the Sudanic belt and Yorubaland were all centres of ancient and continuing urban aggregation thanks to the catalytic impact of political consolidation and international trade. But it is undeniable that European rule gave urbanization in Africa a new impetus by strengthening those political and economic forces already working in that direction. The result was the rise of new urban centres in places, such as Igbo and Ibibio lands of Nigeria, which had not previously experienced urbanization, as well as the expansion of the old centres. This it did largely by creating improved means of communication, new political and administrative headquarters as well as new centres of trade, mineral and agricultural exploitation. In this regard it is noteworthy that between 1850 and 1950, for the continent the critical century of European contact and foreign rule, the annual growth rate of urban population of Africa was 3.9 per cent compared to the world average of 2.6 per cent. This throws much light on the growth rate of urbanization generally in colonial Africa. The new outburst of urban development and expansion invariably meant an increase in its catalytic role in social change.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

MOSELEY'S CAPE COAST FEMALE SCHOOL"", 'section_title': '', 'content': '*Che dura vince!* We write with our heart full of gratitude and praise to God that the long continued and increasing efforts for obtaining the preliminary arrangements which we considered indispensable to the permanent success of Mrs. Moseley\'s projected self-devoting effort at Cape Coast, have at length been crowned with success. Our deeply interested friends at Cape Coast were informed of this by the mail of the 24th October, although the certainty (D.V.) was arrived at too late to allow of our announcing it in our last month\'s issue. Yet a few days or weeks, and one of the African steamers will be bearing to the West Coast a rich tribute of Christian zeal and womanly sympathy in the person of one who relinquishes all the endearments of family and friends, all the refinements of advanced civilisation, because her heart is overflowing with love and pity for a female population growing up in an ignorance that leads to and perpetuates the deepest social debasement, and burns with a holy desire for their Christian and industrial regeneration. It has been a deep disgrace to Great Britain that her PROTECTORATE of Cape Coast has not hitherto been attended by any Government effort to remove that almost impassable barrier against Christian civilisation that is raised by the continuance of the female population in that debased and degraded state to which they have been consigned from generation to generation. Thank God that disgrace is now about to be removed! He has raised up an instrument admirably fitted for the work; her earnestness has prevailed over official inertion and incredulity; and we have now the full conviction that her noble effort will receive that official protection and aid which, as before stated, we have considered to be indispensable to the permanent establishment in Cape Coast of a Christian industrial female school, wherein the present and future rising generations of African females may be brought under the civilising influences of instruction imparted by zealous and devoted Christian Englishwomen, of whom Mrs. Moseley looks upon herself as the first in time only. For although it may—as we pray and hope that it will—please God greatly to bless and prosper her individual exertions in this great and interesting field of labour, it is of course only a foundation that she will be able to lay. The leaven that is to leaven the whole lump of female degradation within the Cape Coast territories will need to be continually replenished; and the work will be begun in faith that He who has filled the one heart with ardent desire thus to labour in that portion of his vineyard, will fill other hearts from time to time with desire to go and do likewise; even as he has moved that of the present distinguished head of the British Executive on the West Coast, Sir A. E. Kennedy, to a full comprehension of the inestimable value of the effort about to be made by Mrs. Moseley, and to a determination to do all that is in his power, both as Governor-in-Chief and as a Christian gentleman, to protect and further the noble work. We should fail in our duty if we did not here tender to his Excellency our most sincere and warmest thanks; and express our joy that the name of one who has already conferred so many benefits on Africa by his enlightened rule (because he feels what the duty of Great Britain really is on the West Coast) will be written indelibly in African annals as associated with this work and labour of love for the African people. Now that the work is, by God\'s blessing, about to commence, we think it incumbent on us to point out how great an advantage it will offer to many educated African parents in other towns of Cape Coast and the Gold Coast; and, the distance not being great, even in Lagos, so soon as adequate accommodation can be provided for them, Mrs. Moseley will, we believe, consent to receive the daughters of such Africans as can afford to pay for their instruction, although they may not be residents in Cape Coast. A growing want of such a place of education in that part of Africa has long been felt; hitherto such Africans in those parts have had no possibility of obtaining a refined Christian education for their daughters without sending them to England; a course which was attended with great risk, and entails a very heavy expense. In consenting to take upon herself this heavy additional labour, we think we are correct in saying that Mrs. Moseley hopes thereby to raise up a class of African lady teachers, who will be competent to instruct others of their race in those Christian principles, industrial pursuits, and social refinements which must be imparted in the first instance by one so admirably fitted to impart them as Mrs. Moseley undoubtedly is. And we cannot avoid expressing the hope and the conviction that the presence of this lady at Cape Coast will be productive of great good in other ways. It seems to us a matter of much importance that such a nucleus of polished female Christian society should exist, where young African ladies who return from being educated in England may find a congenial society, be surrounded by pure and holy, as well as refined associations and influences, and have a kind and sympathising friend and counsellor, ever ready to aid them in preserving the advantages they have obtained by education in England, and in setting before their African sisters who have not been so favoured an example of Christian purity and Christian love. And in proportion as the number of educated Christian women thus increases, it may be hoped that Christian English officials, having thus a society at command in which their wives would find themselves at home, might be induced to bring them out to add to the charms of that society, and to help in the great work of African social regeneration. The moral atmosphere of the place would thus become, in some degree at least, purified; and we might hope to see a more abundant fruit of the labours of those Christian missionaries who have been endeavouring to inculcate Gospel truths and Gospel principles. It is in the belief that such results may flow from the foundation of Mrs. Moseley\'s Female School, that we have given to her noble and self-devoted efforts all the support in our power, and persevered through evil as well as through good report, until now at last her preliminary efforts have been crowned with success, and the scene of her labours is about to be changed from England to Cape Coast. We were about to add, may God go with her! but we feel assured that he will go with her, and support her until she be rewarded by the blessings of many ""who were ready to perish,"" but have found safety, and peace, and joy.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1869#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Degraded State of Accra—Female School Wanted', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The ignorance and want of proper training of the female portion in this our community is another calamity; and contributes to the torrent of evil which now flows in this place.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

We have four seats of government there: Sierra Leone, now as chief, with Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos. We need not insist that education is absolutely necessary to this progress. We might as well set about demonstrating that food and drink are indispensable to the support of animal life. To build up a civilised nation without first creating an educated class is a moral impossibility. In such a class alone can the seed of civilisation germinate, and by it alone can this new principle of life be developed. When, therefore, the declared enemies and traducers of Africa set forth that education there is an engine of demoralisation, we cast aside the ignorant assertion with the contempt it deserves. They might as well pretend to maintain that the antecessarian inhabitants of these islands, with their paint and feathers, their human sacrifices, and other superstitious abominations, were a nobler people, and presented a more agreeable object for contemplation, than the present British subjects of Queen Victoria. Let us have done at once and for ever with these perverse and contemptible absurdities, and look the educational position and requirements of West Africa boldly in the face. We cannot get rid of the solemn obligation that rests upon us by ignoring or evading it. There it is; and it will crop up more and more as we neglect it. Enough has been done, in despite, we may say, of the Government—and shame it is that we should have reason to say it—to make it impossible for us to recede. With the Christian part of it we have happily nothing to do. Our noble Missionary Societies have taken care of that. By their devoted exertions a certain amount of education, coupled happily with religious teaching, has been bestowed. The Anthropologists say this has brought in added vices instead of new virtues. This is a foul falsehood. Civilised vices there are, no doubt, as there are in Great Britain, but such as they are, they are a step in advance of the savage native abominations, and come not with the missionaries, but have been introduced and propagated by Anthropologists and their admirers and adherents, slave-traders, believers in Mohammedan perfection, lovers of Mohammedan indulgencies, and enemies of Christianity and its blessed precepts. We do not look to them for the solution of the problem of African material and moral regeneration even; for if we did, we should look in vain. We might as well expect to find the sewage-fouled mud of our polluted river-shores producing precious gems. We must look to other sources, and we can find these nowhere else but in a continuance and increase of Christian teaching combined with adequate means of education first introduced and supported by Government. We do not wish to alarm the Treasury or the House of Commons. We know that in the present temper of our executive, and of prominent public politicians of all parties as regards Africa, there is no hope for us in them now; nor do we see ground for such hope during long, long years to come, unless the really Christian portion of our population awake to their great responsibility, and combine to give practical Christianity, its precepts and its duties, their proper share of influence in the councils of this nation. Meanwhile let us deal with things as we find them, and we maintain that there is sufficient revenue raised in the various British settlements (since, according to present official phraseology, they are none of them colonies now) to enable the several administrations on the West Coast to take some very efficient steps for promoting that education among the people without which we can never expect such a number of them to emerge from barbarism as will suffice to form those self-governing nations which the British Parliament desires, and which we desire, to see established there; that there is sufficient revenue for this, and at the same time for those sanitary improvements almost equally indispensable, and to which we are glad to see something like proper attention is being now paid at Lagos. In our last we briefly noticed, in a letter from Cape Coast, the state of the Government school there, placed under uneducated discharged soldiers as schoolmasters. In another article in this day's paper, we bring again prominently forward as it merits the relative expenditure in Sierra Leone, for Government schools, and for police, &c., the former under 3000l. a-year, the latter 14,000l., the Inspector-General of Police (a recently-established office, and almost a sinecure), having a salary of nearly double the amount per annum of the sum spent on education; and if we turn to Bathurst or Lagos, we find no bright spot there. If this creditable to the British Government? Does it not rather show a most scandalous neglect of duty on their part? Can any one maintain the existence of any real desire in Downing-street to raise the people of these settlements rapidly to a state of fitness for self-government, or, indeed, to elevate them at all in the social scale? We demand education for the people of the West Coast. They have furnished abundant evidence of their capacity to profit by it. If the Church of England Missionary Society can fit a boy taken out of the hold of a slaver to become a bishop—and no one has ever questioned the fitness of Dr. Samuel Crowther, the Bishop of Niger, for this sacred office—if out of similar materials it has been enabled to train so many men for the duties of ministers of the Church, as to have justified it in withdrawing Europeans from Sierra Leone, and giving over the churches to native pastorate—if the Wesleyans can raise efficient native catechists and pastors for the Cape Coast District, we are not to be met by the assertion that there is no encouragement to attempt a general education of the natives. There is every encouragement; their greatest detractors admit that the Africans learn readily and rapidly up to a certain stage; and we have many salient proofs how very far they\n83"", 'last_edit_date': '1867-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1867#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In that letter Mr. Rosenbush, who has been eighteen years resident at Sierra Leone, states, as an incontrovertible fact, that missionary efforts have produced very beneficial results—that the most cursory comparison of the people of Sierra Leone, composed in a great measure of Africans liberated from the holds of slave-ships, with the natives of places where the influence of missionaries is not known, will establish this without dispute. We refer our readers again to his letter on this very important point, because we feel that as the past has depended, so the future must in no small degree depend, on this of late most calumniated body of men.

The agricultural improvement of the colony demands the special attention of Government authorities; and when, as in this case, a means is pointed out which only requires a better disposal of the revenues raised in the colony itself, by making them instrumental in obtaining reproductive results from the enforced labour of the criminal portion of the population, instead of that labour being wasted, as at present, no trivial objections or inapplicable theories ought to be allowed to stand in the way of its adoption. There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil.

To this our energies are, now, as they have been for years past, devoted. To those who have not considered the matter as we have, the idea of any rapid advancement in the solution might well seem to be Utopian. We have to deal with countries in which the dense ignorance of superstitious barbarism universally prevails—with countries in which the British people do not settle as colonists, where European mercantile houses trade, but do not leave in them any of the profits, if such there be, of their commerce, and where consequently there is little or no increase of capital that may be devoted to works of improvement. We have to deal with countries in which the action of the British Government has been hitherto simply protective, and not in any degree whatever initiative; ameliorating the condition of the people only in so far as the amelioration is necessary to give protection to trade and commerce at the stations which it occupies, and in the dependent territories, by prohibiting at and within them the outrages to humanity in which the most blood-thirsty superstition known in the world formerly indulged—in abolishing that fruitful source of evil and degradation, domestic slavery, and thus leaving the field open for the civilizing agency of commercial intercourse, the unselfish efforts of philanthropy, and of those religious societies which devote themselves to the promulgation of the glad tidings of salvation among the heathen, diffusing among them the great blessing of education, and enabling them to read those Scriptures of truth on the observance of the sacred precepts contained in which the true happiness of the human race so entirely depends. Great indeed have been and are the advantages thus bestowed upon a portion of the people of West Africa. History necessarily affords no parallel. Ere yet the efforts of the British Government to put an end to the odious foreign slave-trade had been crowned with full success, the application of steam in navigation brought those countries into easy communication with the Christian civilization of Great Britain, which may be said to have swooped down upon them, embracing many of them, educated by the religious societies, in its folds. The easy access to England thus afforded by steam has been largely, and is increasingly, availed of by those who had been thus educated, and who, by trade and commerce introduced among them, have obtained the necessary pecuniary means. Not a few of the children of these have also been sent to Great Britain for education. The civilization of Europe has thus become familiar to many, while still the great masses of the people in and beyond the narrow limits of a few Coast towns remain in the dense darkness of heathen ignorance, and more or less openly the victims of heathen superstitions, without any incentive to industrial action beyond what is necessary for obtaining the commonest necessaries of life. Now those countries in which the peoples are thus left to the natural inertia of ignorant tropical humanity, must,—that is our problem—must be brought within the area of Christian civilization. We say Christian civilization, because there is a species of Mahometan civilization, as in Persia; and of heathen, as in China; neither of which we desire for Africa. How are they to be so brought? How? They cannot be so brought except by the civilization by which, we desire them to be embraced,—advancing to their help, seeking them, searching them out, holding forth to them the hand of fellowship, showing them the material advantages it enjoys, and of which it desires to make them partakers. Year after year have we brooded over this problem, our only consolation meanwhile being that the number of more or less educated natives in the Coast towns was in constant increase; that the education they were receiving, being under missionary superintendence, included some knowledge of the articles of universal Christian belief, and, at least, a theoretical acquaintance with those blessed precepts, even the very imperfect observance of which by the inhabitants of the Christian world has contributed so largely to human happiness by emancipating mankind from the cruel tyranny of evil and bringing them partially into the delicious freedom of righteousness. Those natives, more or less educated, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, were indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection should be arranged. That they are not themselves sufficiently under the dominion of Christian civilization to lead them to become its apostles among their hitherto less favoured countrymen has been sufficiently proved by the reception accorded by some of them in Abeokuta to the proposal made by us to link that town with Lagos by means of a railway. They would none of it. They strove to set the heathen mind against it. They would rather things should remain as they are. The education they have received has only served to develop selfishness in them, by showing them the advantages they possess through it over the heathen among whom they dwell—advantages which they do not wish to see reduced by the introduction of others into that portico of the temple of knowledge in which they have themselves secured a footing. But though their help will be unwillingly given, they will and must nevertheless become an important, as they do also constitute a necessary, element in that onward march of civilization which we have projected. The more and more we have studied the problem, the more and more convinced we become, and are, that the onward march must be by means of railways between British sea-coast possessions and the interior. No half measures will suffice. As a first step toward the working out of our problem, we put forward, some twelve months and more ago, our proposals to construct four light railways: three within the Gold Coast territories proper, and one within native territory, with a British Gold Coast Colony possession as a base. We felt that the publication of these proposals would enable us to test the degree in which the educated African element might be made co-operative in the elucidation. We soon discovered that, with two or three individual exceptions, that element was nowhere sufficiently enlightened to be co-operative in any other way than by its paid employment, whenever we should be ready with the pounds, shillings, and pence with which to make the work a personal benefit to each and all of them. Our proposals did not provoke or awake or create the smallest scintilla of interest or enthusiasm. They fell flat upon the understandings, and did not quicken the pulsations of any heart. Almost every individual fraction of this element seemed to fancy that in some way or other a railway, if introduced, would interfere with or prejudice the little trading or other game in which he was engaged; and, as we have before said, with one or two exceptions, the great broad view of human misery to be relieved, of human happiness to be increased, of human emancipation from the fetters of degrading and debasing evil to be achieved, of human benefits to be bestowed, and of the spread of the knowledge of the great and precious gift of eternal life obtainable through faith in Christ Jesus, never presented itself to mind, or heart, or soul,—engrossed only by its own little personal dust-heap, in which it might be grubbing for its own little personal enjoyments, and the gratification of its own little personal vanities and desires.

The aged and the young, parents with their children, males and females, are to be seen in crowds in different quarters of the town, night and day, abandoning themselves to revelry and licentiousness which it is truly painful to behold. Here are large preparations making for a grand country ball which all must attend, and at which grey-headed dames are to be seen teaching the young ones how to dance; there, in the next street, is a host of men and women, boys and girls, drinking and rioting—a funeral custom for a relation who died months ago; and in most cases of this kind a family is put in deep distress and pawned afterwards, to pay for the ruin consumed on the occasion. In another quarter of the town is a great noise of drums, and a large crowd of people gathered, to witness the wild pranks of a professional Fetish female dancer. All this is but a faint description of Accra life and pleasure.\n\nIn looking on at what passes here daily, the idea of the kingdom of Satan naturally presents itself to the mind; and truly Satan is hard at work in this quarter.\n\nThe ignorance and want of proper training of the female portion in this our community is another calamity; and contributes to the torrent of evil which now flows in this place. The few of them who have been partially taught to read, by mixing with bad company, become very much corrupted; and any civilized and Christian stranger who comes here will be rather astonished at the great number of intelligent-looking young women, most of whom cannot repeat the Lord's Prayer. Born and bred up in all worldliness, without any moral restraint, and not knowing anything by which to benefit themselves, they are prepared and seem destined to be the concubines of captains of vessels, Government officials, and European traders, who invariably abandon them and their offspring entirely after a time. But this sinfulness of parents giving their daughters to white men for the sake of their money is an original practice encouraged here up to the present time; and for now a long period, Accra has won the reputation of being a place where all sorts and conditions of white men can come and take one of these as a concubine, to go anywhere he may choose, at a moment's notice.\n\nThis state of things induced us lately to petition the Government to establish a school here, for the education and moral culture of the rising generation of Accra; and I earnestly pray that the Lord will put it into their hearts to do this."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_02_1873#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain.

No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

It is now nearly twelve months since Lagos was pointed out to us, as at one and the same time carrying on an extensive slave-trade, and recruiting the ranks of domestic slavery within the colony; unchecked, though we never can admit that it could have been unobserved, by the British authorities there; and until then not denounced, or publicly rebuked, either by Christian missionaries or the admitted and acknowledged members of their respective churches. The European missionaries, and the native pastors and teachers, all, we are bound to presume, deeply imbued with the principles and precepts inculcated by Him who preached the Sermon on the Mount, are not few in number; while the communicants in the churches may be counted by hundreds. How is it to be accounted for, that of this not inconsiderable body of British officials and missionaries, and native pastors, teachers, and communicants, not one, until our correspondent addressed us on the subject,—not one, we say, entered the lists against what they know to be as abominable in the eyes of British law, as it is repugnant to the spirit of that Christianity which they all profess? We can only account for it by what seems to be the fact, that as we have stated, the whole atmosphere of Africa is so tainted by the spirit of the slave-trade and of slavery, that to inhale it produces a moral and spiritual torpor, from which only an exceptionally vigorous and sensitive conscience can free itself. Under such circumstances, an independent and uncompromising public Press is manifestly a vital necessity for Africa, if the hope is to be indulged of her ever being reclaimed from that abyss of misery and degradation, of moral filth and spiritual loathsomeness into which she has been plunged, by the long-continued dominion within her of the most debasing superstitions and vices that ever fettered humanity. Regard it as they may in the vitiated atmosphere they breathe on the African Coast, and familiarized as they are with the abominable evil, so as to be perhaps unconscious of its ruinous tendencies, our African readers may rest assured that the material progress which is so important for them as regards their trading operations, depends in a very great degree on the extent to which freedom shall replace slavery. These readers of ours, we are told, comprise every African on the West Coast who has any pretension whatever to be classed as an educated man. We call upon them all to lay this truth seriously to heart. If they desire the development of the resources of the countries that supply the produce in which they trade, they should use all their influence, individually and collectively, against those gigantic paralyzers of human energies for purposes of good, the slave-trade and slavery. Their eye should not pity, their heart should not spare, any one among themselves whose covetousness, or other vile and debasing lusts, may lead him to dishonour the education that has been bestowed upon him, by buying or selling his fellow-creatures. The letters from Lagos and Cape Coast, to which we gave insertion in our August number, show, unhappily, how very necessary it is that we place these truths clearly and constantly before them, so long as God may grant us the energy and means to do so. The Hydra of African slavery must be killed. We have pledged ourselves to a war of extermination against it. Every educated man and woman on the West Coast ought to be active and energetic soldiers in our army. Thanks especially to the exertions of our noble missionary societies, there is now no inconsiderable number of educated women on the Coast; women, Christians too we hope in reality, as well as in profession, in addition to being educated. This great question of the total disappearance of slavery from among them; of that horribly debasing, degrading institution, under which members of their own sex may be purchased—victims in body and soul—ministers to lust and to every brutal passion, for a few pounds sterling, or dollars, or pieces of cloth, or bags of cowries—this question, we repeat, touches them nearly. The position that they and their educated female children may occupy; the greater or less consideration with which they will be regarded and treated, depends in no small degree, on the continuance or annihilation of female domestic slavery. They must—it is inevitable—they must be included, more or less, in the degradation that falls upon their human sisters. We call upon them to regard it as an accursed thing; as striking at the very root of that elevation of themselves in the community, to which their sex has attained in the Christian countries of Europe. We call upon them to look at it as the forbidden spoil in the tent of Achan, bringing a curse upon the whole community to which the culprit belongs. It is quite time that the educated women in Africa, particularly in the British settlements, where they are under the protection of British laws, should make their purifying influence felt in this vital matter. It is for them to cast a halo of purity and of Christian love around; to show in practice as in word, that they love their poorer sisters as themselves. It is only thus that there can be any hope of the purification of African society; any hope of that material as well as Christian advancement, which can alone raise Africa from the degraded position it holds in European opinion; a position owing in no small degree to that abominable slave-trade and slavery, which we call upon them to use their utmost efforts to eradicate.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With these accounts of the rapid spread of Islam we may compare statements as to the comparative failure of Christianity, which, unlike Mohammedanism, is propagated and supported by vast subsidies from England and America.

Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them.""

Notably, the textbook does not specifically mention Mrs. Moseley's school or Cape Coast initiatives, indicating a gap in its coverage of local educational efforts for women. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim, portraying Mrs. Moseley's efforts as a noble and necessary endeavor to uplift women, who were in a degraded state due to lack of education and social recognition. The articles emphasize female education as foundational to Christian civilization and social elevation, highlighting the potential for educated women to contribute significantly to the regeneration of Africa. They also mention support from various individuals and organizations, reflecting a collective acknowledgment of the importance of female education, albeit framed within a colonial perspective of Christian duty and civilization.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education.

In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': 'Finally, there was the question of differing African responses to foreign influences.

In North Africa and Egypt, on the other hand, sections of the ruling elite sought to ensure the survival of Islamic culture through the introduction of western science and commerce. Their stand led to a fruitful marriage between Islamic culture and western scientific thought.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

Assignments were given which resulted in the students' explora› tion of both the form and substance of indigeous art. Groups from every colonial territory represented at William Ponty were then expected to return from vacation, armed with a theatrical presentation based on their researches, the entire direction being left in the hands of the students themselves.

It would be too much to expect that, at that period, the 'classic' model of French theatre could yield completely to the expression of traditional forms. The 'community' represented by William Ponty was an artificial one. It was distanced from the society whose cultural hoards it rifled both in qualitative thought and in cultural ends. The situation was of course not peculiar to William Ponty but was common to the other schools and institutions set up by the colonizer for the fulfilment of his own mission in Africa.

Already beloved by the female population at Cape Coast, she would commence her noble labours with advantages that many ladies might fail to secure, even were other ladies disposed thus to exile themselves from that civilization which must be so dear, in order to labour in such a country as that of Guinea in the cause of humanity and of Him who gave himself a sacrifice for mankind.

MOSELEY'S CAPE COAST FEMALE SCHOOL"", 'section_title': '', 'content': '*Che dura vince!* We write with our heart full of gratitude and praise to God that the long continued and increasing efforts for obtaining the preliminary arrangements which we considered indispensable to the permanent success of Mrs. Moseley\'s projected self-devoting effort at Cape Coast, have at length been crowned with success. Our deeply interested friends at Cape Coast were informed of this by the mail of the 24th October, although the certainty (D.V.) was arrived at too late to allow of our announcing it in our last month\'s issue. Yet a few days or weeks, and one of the African steamers will be bearing to the West Coast a rich tribute of Christian zeal and womanly sympathy in the person of one who relinquishes all the endearments of family and friends, all the refinements of advanced civilisation, because her heart is overflowing with love and pity for a female population growing up in an ignorance that leads to and perpetuates the deepest social debasement, and burns with a holy desire for their Christian and industrial regeneration. It has been a deep disgrace to Great Britain that her PROTECTORATE of Cape Coast has not hitherto been attended by any Government effort to remove that almost impassable barrier against Christian civilisation that is raised by the continuance of the female population in that debased and degraded state to which they have been consigned from generation to generation. Thank God that disgrace is now about to be removed! He has raised up an instrument admirably fitted for the work; her earnestness has prevailed over official inertion and incredulity; and we have now the full conviction that her noble effort will receive that official protection and aid which, as before stated, we have considered to be indispensable to the permanent establishment in Cape Coast of a Christian industrial female school, wherein the present and future rising generations of African females may be brought under the civilising influences of instruction imparted by zealous and devoted Christian Englishwomen, of whom Mrs. Moseley looks upon herself as the first in time only. For although it may—as we pray and hope that it will—please God greatly to bless and prosper her individual exertions in this great and interesting field of labour, it is of course only a foundation that she will be able to lay. The leaven that is to leaven the whole lump of female degradation within the Cape Coast territories will need to be continually replenished; and the work will be begun in faith that He who has filled the one heart with ardent desire thus to labour in that portion of his vineyard, will fill other hearts from time to time with desire to go and do likewise; even as he has moved that of the present distinguished head of the British Executive on the West Coast, Sir A. E. Kennedy, to a full comprehension of the inestimable value of the effort about to be made by Mrs. Moseley, and to a determination to do all that is in his power, both as Governor-in-Chief and as a Christian gentleman, to protect and further the noble work. We should fail in our duty if we did not here tender to his Excellency our most sincere and warmest thanks; and express our joy that the name of one who has already conferred so many benefits on Africa by his enlightened rule (because he feels what the duty of Great Britain really is on the West Coast) will be written indelibly in African annals as associated with this work and labour of love for the African people. Now that the work is, by God\'s blessing, about to commence, we think it incumbent on us to point out how great an advantage it will offer to many educated African parents in other towns of Cape Coast and the Gold Coast; and, the distance not being great, even in Lagos, so soon as adequate accommodation can be provided for them, Mrs. Moseley will, we believe, consent to receive the daughters of such Africans as can afford to pay for their instruction, although they may not be residents in Cape Coast. A growing want of such a place of education in that part of Africa has long been felt; hitherto such Africans in those parts have had no possibility of obtaining a refined Christian education for their daughters without sending them to England; a course which was attended with great risk, and entails a very heavy expense. In consenting to take upon herself this heavy additional labour, we think we are correct in saying that Mrs. Moseley hopes thereby to raise up a class of African lady teachers, who will be competent to instruct others of their race in those Christian principles, industrial pursuits, and social refinements which must be imparted in the first instance by one so admirably fitted to impart them as Mrs. Moseley undoubtedly is. And we cannot avoid expressing the hope and the conviction that the presence of this lady at Cape Coast will be productive of great good in other ways. It seems to us a matter of much importance that such a nucleus of polished female Christian society should exist, where young African ladies who return from being educated in England may find a congenial society, be surrounded by pure and holy, as well as refined associations and influences, and have a kind and sympathising friend and counsellor, ever ready to aid them in preserving the advantages they have obtained by education in England, and in setting before their African sisters who have not been so favoured an example of Christian purity and Christian love. And in proportion as the number of educated Christian women thus increases, it may be hoped that Christian English officials, having thus a society at command in which their wives would find themselves at home, might be induced to bring them out to add to the charms of that society, and to help in the great work of African social regeneration. The moral atmosphere of the place would thus become, in some degree at least, purified; and we might hope to see a more abundant fruit of the labours of those Christian missionaries who have been endeavouring to inculcate Gospel truths and Gospel principles. It is in the belief that such results may flow from the foundation of Mrs. Moseley\'s Female School, that we have given to her noble and self-devoted efforts all the support in our power, and persevered through evil as well as through good report, until now at last her preliminary efforts have been crowned with success, and the scene of her labours is about to be changed from England to Cape Coast. We were about to add, may God go with her! but we feel assured that he will go with her, and support her until she be rewarded by the blessings of many ""who were ready to perish,"" but have found safety, and peace, and joy.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1869#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.765, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPE COAST FEMALE SCHOOL', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is not often that we now ask our English readers to give anything for Africa, or for the cause of God and man in Africa. One cannot be always rolling a stone uphill. If we are to judge by results, we should say it has become a fixed idea in all but a few superior minds that to give for African objects is to throw money away. The old Christian sympathies for Africa seem to have made an Arctic voyage and become thoroughly iced. They will thaw some day—of that we have no doubt—and for the most part we endeavor to wait with as good a grace as possible. But there are some things to be done that strike so immediately and directly at the worst of the evils of African society, that to withhold the pecuniary means, when the more precious ones of devoted Christian zeal and self-sacrificing human sympathy are ready for action, is a deplorable neglect of duty. To hope against constant disappointment is difficult, but in one case, at least, we do try to hope that such neglect of duty will not appear. The Cape Coast Female School, for which Mrs. Moseley, widow of a late chief justice of the Supreme Court at the Gold Coast, is seeking the necessary funds, ought to be commenced forthwith. There is no real Christian civilization possible anywhere without a previous release of the female part of the population from those degradations to which they are subject in heathen and barbarous countries. A real civilization must begin with the education and refinement of woman. When at Cape Coast, Mrs. Moseley, whose Christian heart was deeply grieved at the debased condition of the women and the utter neglect of the female children, made some efforts at imparting instruction, which were most gratefully welcomed by the people, and promised to be attended with very beneficial results. The poor creatures saw that a kind and generous heart was interested in their welfare, and they repaid her efforts with a warm and most gratifying tribute of affection. It is impossible to estimate the good that might be effected by the devoted labors of a refined and cultivated Christian lady such as Mrs. Moseley really is. We are sure that, if our readers could see her and hear her plead for the poor people for whose welfare she is ready to give up all the charms of a refined society she is so eminently fitted to adorn, they would feel so powerfully the influence of that sense of Christian duty by which she is actuated to make such sacrifices, that they would soon double the amount now stated to be indispensable to the commencement of the work at Cape Coast. We refer our readers, our lady readers especially, to Mrs. Moseley\'s letter which appears in our third page. They will perceive that some 300l. and more is still wanting, and that 100l. worth of articles for a fancy fair has been promised. We do not take the liberty of attempting to dictate to our readers how this 300l. is to be made up, whether by direct money, subscriptions, or by bazaar efforts—all we say is, make it up some way or other. Any further information required on the subject may be obtained by addressing Mrs. Moseley direct. The blessing of ""those that were ready to perish"" will certainly be given to such as render assistance in this case. As there is now a native Christian King at the town of Cape Coast, the attendant local circumstances are particularly favorable at present for the work Mrs. Moseley is so devotedly anxious to inaugurate.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPE COAST FEMALE SCHOOL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We approach our editorial duties this month with feelings it will be difficult adequately to express; feelings of triumph, of thankfulness, and at the same time of regret—of triumph and thankfulness that by God's blessing a great and important stage in the establishment of the long-desired Cape Coast Female School is now reached in the arranged departure of Mrs. Mosely by the steamer of the 5th April; regret that a dear friend whom we so much esteem and love, should be thus called by the sense of duty to God, and love to her fellow-creatures, to so distant a field of labour. It is not likely that there can be any adequate idea among our friends on the West Coast, of the heavy personal sacrifices which such a step on the part of such a lady involves; where cherished family ties must be torn asunder, and so many dear Christian friends be left. We hope, however, they will believe us when we tell them that the sacrifice is a heavy one, and such a one as only an extreme Christian love for the souls of the rising female population of Cape Coast could induce. There are many—alas! too many—fields of Christian labour in England, requiring talents such as those with which Mrs. Mosely is so richly endowed; fields in which great good might be done, and labour in which would not involve any of those painful sacrifices to which we have referred; but all these are passed by because of a great love for the African people, and the conviction that among them is the field of labour to which God has especially called her by the mysterious workings of his providence. We hope that all this will be borne in mind by our readers at Cape Coast; that they will impress this upon those around them, and that there will at least be a hearty endeavour on their part to help by any means in their power, in the work to which this lady has thus devoted herself for the good of that race and that community of which they form a part. We need not say that our heart goes with Mrs. Mosely in her disinterested work and labour of love, and that we sympathise fully with her desire for the Christian advancement of the African people.

The textbook highlights the negative impact of colonialism on women's status, noting their exclusion from Western education and professional opportunities, which limited their roles in new colonial political and social structures. This exclusion suggests that empowering women through education could have enhanced their influence on the community's social, moral, and religious character, aligning with the claim.

In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim, emphasizing female education as foundational to Christian civilization and societal advancement. They highlight efforts like Mrs. Moseley's establishment of a female school at Cape Coast as crucial for elevating women's social and moral status, arguing that educated women lead to a more refined and morally upright community. The articles also discuss the negative consequences of gender disparities, such as the degradation of women, underscoring the necessity of female education to prevent such outcomes.

Literacy gave the elite access to the scientific and social thought of the western world, equipped them to enter into dialogue with the colonial powers over the destiny of Africa, and familiarized them with the social fashions of Europe which made their life style an example to be emulated by their less fortunate countrymen.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'The greatest social impact of the missionary revolution, however, was the emergence of an educated elite in Africa.

The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The spread of Christianity, Islam and western education was another important impact of colonialism. There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony. It is signifi› cant that except in North Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar, these languages have remained the official languages even to this very day.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'African traditional religion and colonial rule', 'content': ""What missionaries found particularly abhorrent was female initiation, and they vehemently spoke against it, and the Church of Scotland Mission, African Inland Church, and Gospel Missionary Society prohibited it in their churches in 1920 and 1921. Boys' circumcision among Christians was not as severely interfered with, but the missions required that it should be done in hospitals or private homes. As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end. But the Africans felt that both male and female initiation served a profoundly meaningful purpose in their communal life and that any sudden abolition or prohibition would greatly disrupt their psycho› logical, social and religious security.\nThe African opposition to the negative attitude towards female circum› cision came into the open in the early 1920s, beginning in 1923. For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue. In 1929 a dance song, called muthirigu, which ridiculed missions and Christians who were opposed to female initiation, spread quickly among the Gikuyu but was banned by the British colonial administration the following year. Furthermore African opposition ex› pressed itself in the secession of many members from the Protestant and Anglican churches among the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru peoples. An independent Church, the African Orthodox Church, arose in 1928, while in 1930 a prophetic movement sprang up among the Gikuyu, preaching God's impending judgement upon Europeans and missions, but was quickly banned by the colonial administration.\nAfrican protest continued to express itself in many forms, including disturbances, attacks on mission schools, attempts to prevent preachers from conducting services, and even the murder of a missionary at Kijabe. Combined with the African protest against the missionary attitude to female circumcision was also a growing nationalism which eventually resulted in political resistance against foreign rule.

But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible. The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""also created in some Africans a deep sense of inferiority which Afigbo has defined above quite succintly as 'a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future in short, a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of [and one may add subservience to] European powers' (Chapter 19).

As A. E. Afigbo has pointed out (Chapter 19), though the traditional social structure allowed for social mobility, its class structure appeared to give undue weight to birth. The new colonial order on the other hand, emphasized individual merit and achievement rather than birth. This change together with the abolition of slavery, the intro› duction of western education, Christianity and Islam, the expansion of cash-crop agriculture which facilitated the acquisition of wealth in some areas and the many other avenues for advancement that the new colonial order introduced, radically altered the traditional social structure. Thus, by the 1930s, in place of the pre-colonial social classes of the traditional ruling aristocracy, the ordinary people, domestic slaves and a relatively small educated elite, had emerged a new society that had become more sharply divided than before into urban and rural dwellers, each of which was differently stratified. The urban dwellers had become divided into three main sub-groups: the elite or as others call them the administrativeclerical-professional bourgeoisie; the non-elite or, as Lloyd prefers to call them, the sub-elite, and the urban proletariat. The elite was subdivided into three groups: the bureaucratic elite of civil servants, the professional elite of doctors, lawyers, architects, surveyors, professors, etc., and the commercial elite of managers of the expatriate firms and companies and private traders and businessmen. The sub-elite consisted of brokers, middlemen, clerks, teachers, nurses and junior civil servants, while the urban proletariat consisted of the wage-earners, store assistants, drivers, mechanics, messengers, tailors, bricklayers, etc. In the rural areas, there emerged for the first time in many parts of Africa new classes, namely, a rural proletariat of landless Africans, and peasants. The former consisted of those Africans especially in East and Southern Africa, whose lands had been alienated by the Europeans but who were not allowed to reside permanently in the urban and industrial centres and were therefore com› pelled to spend their lives shunting between the urban and rural areas, mainly as migrant labourers.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained.

In Uganda, for example, a Witchcraft Ordinance was passed in 1912; in 1921 it was revised, the punishment being made severer by increasing terms of imprisonment from one to five years and also making the possession of witchcraft articles in which the power of witchcraft is believed to reside a punishable offence. 1 $^{3}$ But all these ordinances of the colonial governments and condemnation by missionaries and African converts proved to be limited deterrents to the belief in witchcraft.\nAnother attack on African traditional religion took the form of measures against initiation rites of boys and girls into adulthood.

Many that in 1859 sat on those forms are now grown up, and advanced in life socially, as well as physically, being clerks in the Government and mercantile offices in Wellington-street, not only earning their own livelihood, but aiding their parents, who had not the same advantages during their season of youth.\n\nThis school has always particularly pleased me, being founded on true Christian principles. The schoolmaster by direction makes no difference in his attention towards the classes. I do not allude to No. 1 class, or No. 2 class, but generally to the right and left hand of the school. You will now know I mean the girls and the boys. As I ride through the country, I frequently see the Fodeys, or village schoolmasters, teaching the boys the Koran, but never the girls. If you remember, this morning I asked the girls\' class the meaning of the word ""blessing."" It is a blessing, my dear little girls, to be born in a Christian country, where the Gospel and the light of knowledge is not withheld from you on account of your sex.\n\nWhy is Great Britain so pre-eminently blessed among the nations of the earth? It is because the women of England are so honoured and so highly educated. All the good men whose lives you have read of at my request, since last examination, had gifted mothers; indeed, a work has been lately written, entitled ""The Mothers of Great Men."" The Almighty having given to the gentler sex emotions so sweet and merciful, it is unreasonable not to foster so tender a plant by education. It was a woman who said to the Roman Governor of Jerusalem, on an occasion well known to you all, ""Have thou nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."" It was the gentle influence of the women of India whereby hundreds of English women and children were saved from the fangs of that tiger Nana Sahib; and, to speak of events nearer home, it was a woman of your own blood who gave food and shelter to Mungo Park, when lying exhausted on the burning sand of Africa.\n\nIf such mercy is implanted by the Almighty in the breast of the softer sex, how much more may we not expect it to fructify, and be doubly blessed, by the influence of education.'}, {'id': 761, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST FEMALE SCHOOL', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST FEMALE SCHOOL', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1865#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_12_1865', 'content': 'It is not often that we now ask our English readers to give anything for Africa, or for the cause of God and man in Africa. One cannot be always rolling a stone uphill. If we are to judge by results, we should say it has become a fixed idea in all but a few superior minds that to give for African objects is to throw money away. The old Christian sympathies for Africa seem to have made an Arctic voyage and become thoroughly iced. They will thaw some day—of that we have no doubt—and for the most part we endeavor to wait with as good a grace as possible. But there are some things to be done that strike so immediately and directly at the worst of the evils of African society, that to withhold the pecuniary means, when the more precious ones of devoted Christian zeal and self-sacrificing human sympathy are ready for action, is a deplorable neglect of duty. To hope against constant disappointment is difficult, but in one case, at least, we do try to hope that such neglect of duty will not appear. The Cape Coast Female School, for which Mrs. Moseley, widow of a late chief justice of the Supreme Court at the Gold Coast, is seeking the necessary funds, ought to be commenced forthwith. There is no real Christian civilization possible anywhere without a previous release of the female part of the population from those degradations to which they are subject in heathen and barbarous countries. A real civilization must begin with the education and refinement of woman. When at Cape Coast, Mrs. Moseley, whose Christian heart was deeply grieved at the debased condition of the women and the utter neglect of the female children, made some efforts at imparting instruction, which were most gratefully welcomed by the people, and promised to be attended with very beneficial results. The poor creatures saw that a kind and generous heart was interested in their welfare, and they repaid her efforts with a warm and most gratifying tribute of affection. It is impossible to estimate the good that might be effected by the devoted labors of a refined and cultivated Christian lady such as Mrs. Moseley really is. We are sure that, if our readers could see her and hear her plead for the poor people for whose welfare she is ready to give up all the charms of a refined society she is so eminently fitted to adorn, they would feel so powerfully the influence of that sense of Christian duty by which she is actuated to make such sacrifices, that they would soon double the amount now stated to be indispensable to the commencement of the work at Cape Coast. We refer our readers, our lady readers especially, to Mrs. Moseley\'s letter which appears in our third page. They will perceive that some 300l. and more is still wanting, and that 100l. worth of articles for a fancy fair has been promised. We do not take the liberty of attempting to dictate to our readers how this 300l. is to be made up, whether by direct money, subscriptions, or by bazaar efforts—all we say is, make it up some way or other. Any further information required on the subject may be obtained by addressing Mrs. Moseley direct. The blessing of ""those that were ready to perish"" will certainly be given to such as render assistance in this case. As there is now a native Christian King at the town of Cape Coast, the attendant local circumstances are particularly favorable at present for the work Mrs. Moseley is so devotedly anxious to inaugurate.'}, {'id': 855, 'article_title': 'ON EDUCATION IN AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'ON EDUCATION IN AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_06_1866', 'content': '\n\nThere are no means separate from the truths of the Bible that can ever help civilisation; dispersion of the Bible as a book, and preaching its truths as God\'s message to fallen man, is an advertisement, so to speak, that says ""This is the way, walk ye in it."" To influence the lives of a people to whom these principles were once unknown belongs to Christian education so begun. One of the greatest helps a people can offer to those who would teach them the ways of civilised life is the encouragement held out by the natives themselves towards the work they are anxious to accomplish. ""Come over and help us"" is the recorded invitation to the early Apostles, from a country that had not yet heard more than a rumor of the new religion. Some of the readers of the African Times may already suspect that the locality of Cape Coast Castle is in the present writer\'s mind. Its especial claim to help arises from the anxiety of the native chiefs to see an increase of English influence diffused among their people. The means to procure what they desire appear to be within the easy grasp of such as desire to obtain them. If the merchants of the district had no higher aim than the profit of their mercantile traffic, they would find that was aided by the employment of educated labourers rather than uneducated men. Education does not necessarily consist in the knowledge of so many words, or languages, or sciences. Education is rather the rousing of latent mental and perceptive power, so as to make it available for common life. In this lowest estimate of education it is profitable to an African employer by giving him more intelligent service than he has been accustomed to expect; the work is better done by an artisan or clerk who performs it intelligently than by one who only acts on his own unawakened powers in the matter. This argument can be pursued in reference to the further diffusion of education for the practical purposes of life among the natives, both male and female, on the Gold Coast. There is also an extended district to be affected by the establishment of an English system of teaching for both rich and poor who desire to seek such advantages, and who are hindered by distance from seeking in England the education they covet. The English system of teaching proposed in reference to Cape Coast Castle has for its especial object the Christian education of the native women and girls of that country. These need help; every one who has devoted thought and labour in the work of education knows that the women of a people exercise great influence either for good or evil. It is a dreadful truth in connexion with the French Revolution of the last century, that the degraded women were far more furious in their cruelties and their sins than the men of the same epoch. The women and girls, then, should be the especial objects for Christian education where it is begun as something new amongst them; and there are many native and other merchants, as well as influential men, who are wishing to see remedied this evil of ignorance among the females of the land. Raise the women, and the whole community will in a few years be raised in social, moral, and, above all, in religious character. St. Paul wrote of the refined heathens of civilised Rome, ""They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator."" Civilization is not rightmindedness; idolatry is the sin of the natural heart untrained to seek for spiritual influences. The young female mind is impressive to truth. Faith, it has been said, is more easy to the clinging nature of a woman than to the more vigorous will and understanding of a man. The holy precepts of the Bible must be the foundation of all that is to advance and improve the native character of the African; and who shall measure the result on the civilization and well-being of the country arising from the tiny seed of first principles implanted in the young, and nourished by practice and by example in all that is holy, and just, and true? Dr. Johnson once said, ""Whatever causes the past or the future to predominate over the present raises us in the scale of thinking beings."" This is the key-note for us to strike in order to dispel ignorance.

Brownall, late of the Gold Coast Artillery, writes as follows:—\n\n""I have been a resident on the West Coast of Africa for ten years and upwards, and in my public military capacity have travelled over the whole of the Protectorate; hence I am enabled to speak from observation and experience of the character, manners, and customs of the inhabitants of that benighted and neglected country.\n\n""It is lamentable to find that the efforts that have been made during the last thirty or forty years to civilise and bring to the knowledge of Christ these much-neglected people have not produced equal results with those made among other nations in a similar position.\n\n""To me the cause is obvious. It is not, as some have stated (unjustly and unkindly), the want of intellect or the repugnance evinced by the natives to receive assistance and information from those who have so long laboured amongst them, but from the deep-rooted superstition which prevails, inherited from their forefathers, which cannot be at once eradicated from their minds.\n\n""The natives generally are particularly intelligent, very grateful, and anxious to gain information, not addicted to the violent passions and cruelties practised by other unchristian nations. Why, then, should not the great cause of Christian civilization progress in West Africa as in other settlements?\n\n""It is, in my opinion, because the female part of the community are kept in such a degraded state. They are uneducated, and looked upon by the other sex as mere slaves, and treated as such. Their lives are devoted to manual labour, and their persons frequently sold or pawned to supply the pecuniary wants of their owners, instead of being respected and looked up to as equals, and helpmates in Christian and domestic happiness. Until the female population is raised to its proper position, Christian civilization can never arrive at that standard which we are all anxious to witness, and which it is our duty, as followers of Christ, to endeavour to reach.\n\n""Mrs. Moseley, the widow of the much-beloved and respected judge who was stationed at Cape Coast, and greatly esteemed and regretted by all, and especially by the native population, has, I am happy to find, come forward and offered her services in establishing an infant female school at Cape Coast.\n\n""With God\'s assistance, and a person so well qualified as Mrs. Moseley, we may look forward to great results. This female school, I trust, will be a step in the right direction, as domestic acquirements will be blended with Christian instruction, which will ultimately render the female population valuable members of society, and raise them from their present degraded state.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1866#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""MRS.

Our deeply interested friends at Cape Coast were informed of this by the mail of the 24th October, although the certainty (D.V.) was arrived at too late to allow of our announcing it in our last month\'s issue. Yet a few days or weeks, and one of the African steamers will be bearing to the West Coast a rich tribute of Christian zeal and womanly sympathy in the person of one who relinquishes all the endearments of family and friends, all the refinements of advanced civilisation, because her heart is overflowing with love and pity for a female population growing up in an ignorance that leads to and perpetuates the deepest social debasement, and burns with a holy desire for their Christian and industrial regeneration. It has been a deep disgrace to Great Britain that her PROTECTORATE of Cape Coast has not hitherto been attended by any Government effort to remove that almost impassable barrier against Christian civilisation that is raised by the continuance of the female population in that debased and degraded state to which they have been consigned from generation to generation. Thank God that disgrace is now about to be removed! He has raised up an instrument admirably fitted for the work; her earnestness has prevailed over official inertion and incredulity; and we have now the full conviction that her noble effort will receive that official protection and aid which, as before stated, we have considered to be indispensable to the permanent establishment in Cape Coast of a Christian industrial female school, wherein the present and future rising generations of African females may be brought under the civilising influences of instruction imparted by zealous and devoted Christian Englishwomen, of whom Mrs. Moseley looks upon herself as the first in time only. For although it may—as we pray and hope that it will—please God greatly to bless and prosper her individual exertions in this great and interesting field of labour, it is of course only a foundation that she will be able to lay. The leaven that is to leaven the whole lump of female degradation within the Cape Coast territories will need to be continually replenished; and the work will be begun in faith that He who has filled the one heart with ardent desire thus to labour in that portion of his vineyard, will fill other hearts from time to time with desire to go and do likewise; even as he has moved that of the present distinguished head of the British Executive on the West Coast, Sir A. E. Kennedy, to a full comprehension of the inestimable value of the effort about to be made by Mrs. Moseley, and to a determination to do all that is in his power, both as Governor-in-Chief and as a Christian gentleman, to protect and further the noble work. We should fail in our duty if we did not here tender to his Excellency our most sincere and warmest thanks; and express our joy that the name of one who has already conferred so many benefits on Africa by his enlightened rule (because he feels what the duty of Great Britain really is on the West Coast) will be written indelibly in African annals as associated with this work and labour of love for the African people. Now that the work is, by God\'s blessing, about to commence, we think it incumbent on us to point out how great an advantage it will offer to many educated African parents in other towns of Cape Coast and the Gold Coast; and, the distance not being great, even in Lagos, so soon as adequate accommodation can be provided for them, Mrs. Moseley will, we believe, consent to receive the daughters of such Africans as can afford to pay for their instruction, although they may not be residents in Cape Coast. A growing want of such a place of education in that part of Africa has long been felt; hitherto such Africans in those parts have had no possibility of obtaining a refined Christian education for their daughters without sending them to England; a course which was attended with great risk, and entails a very heavy expense. In consenting to take upon herself this heavy additional labour, we think we are correct in saying that Mrs. Moseley hopes thereby to raise up a class of African lady teachers, who will be competent to instruct others of their race in those Christian principles, industrial pursuits, and social refinements which must be imparted in the first instance by one so admirably fitted to impart them as Mrs. Moseley undoubtedly is. And we cannot avoid expressing the hope and the conviction that the presence of this lady at Cape Coast will be productive of great good in other ways. It seems to us a matter of much importance that such a nucleus of polished female Christian society should exist, where young African ladies who return from being educated in England may find a congenial society, be surrounded by pure and holy, as well as refined associations and influences, and have a kind and sympathising friend and counsellor, ever ready to aid them in preserving the advantages they have obtained by education in England, and in setting before their African sisters who have not been so favoured an example of Christian purity and Christian love. And in proportion as the number of educated Christian women thus increases, it may be hoped that Christian English officials, having thus a society at command in which their wives would find themselves at home, might be induced to bring them out to add to the charms of that society, and to help in the great work of African social regeneration. The moral atmosphere of the place would thus become, in some degree at least, purified; and we might hope to see a more abundant fruit of the labours of those Christian missionaries who have been endeavouring to inculcate Gospel truths and Gospel principles. It is in the belief that such results may flow from the foundation of Mrs. Moseley\'s Female School, that we have given to her noble and self-devoted efforts all the support in our power, and persevered through evil as well as through good report, until now at last her preliminary efforts have been crowned with success, and the scene of her labours is about to be changed from England to Cape Coast.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Too much praise cannot be given you for your unwearied and long-continued efforts on behalf of poor Africa and her unfortunate sons.

It is now nearly twelve months since Lagos was pointed out to us, as at one and the same time carrying on an extensive slave-trade, and recruiting the ranks of domestic slavery within the colony; unchecked, though we never can admit that it could have been unobserved, by the British authorities there; and until then not denounced, or publicly rebuked, either by Christian missionaries or the admitted and acknowledged members of their respective churches. The European missionaries, and the native pastors and teachers, all, we are bound to presume, deeply imbued with the principles and precepts inculcated by Him who preached the Sermon on the Mount, are not few in number; while the communicants in the churches may be counted by hundreds. How is it to be accounted for, that of this not inconsiderable body of British officials and missionaries, and native pastors, teachers, and communicants, not one, until our correspondent addressed us on the subject,—not one, we say, entered the lists against what they know to be as abominable in the eyes of British law, as it is repugnant to the spirit of that Christianity which they all profess? We can only account for it by what seems to be the fact, that as we have stated, the whole atmosphere of Africa is so tainted by the spirit of the slave-trade and of slavery, that to inhale it produces a moral and spiritual torpor, from which only an exceptionally vigorous and sensitive conscience can free itself. Under such circumstances, an independent and uncompromising public Press is manifestly a vital necessity for Africa, if the hope is to be indulged of her ever being reclaimed from that abyss of misery and degradation, of moral filth and spiritual loathsomeness into which she has been plunged, by the long-continued dominion within her of the most debasing superstitions and vices that ever fettered humanity. Regard it as they may in the vitiated atmosphere they breathe on the African Coast, and familiarized as they are with the abominable evil, so as to be perhaps unconscious of its ruinous tendencies, our African readers may rest assured that the material progress which is so important for them as regards their trading operations, depends in a very great degree on the extent to which freedom shall replace slavery. These readers of ours, we are told, comprise every African on the West Coast who has any pretension whatever to be classed as an educated man. We call upon them all to lay this truth seriously to heart. If they desire the development of the resources of the countries that supply the produce in which they trade, they should use all their influence, individually and collectively, against those gigantic paralyzers of human energies for purposes of good, the slave-trade and slavery. Their eye should not pity, their heart should not spare, any one among themselves whose covetousness, or other vile and debasing lusts, may lead him to dishonour the education that has been bestowed upon him, by buying or selling his fellow-creatures. The letters from Lagos and Cape Coast, to which we gave insertion in our August number, show, unhappily, how very necessary it is that we place these truths clearly and constantly before them, so long as God may grant us the energy and means to do so. The Hydra of African slavery must be killed. We have pledged ourselves to a war of extermination against it. Every educated man and woman on the West Coast ought to be active and energetic soldiers in our army. Thanks especially to the exertions of our noble missionary societies, there is now no inconsiderable number of educated women on the Coast; women, Christians too we hope in reality, as well as in profession, in addition to being educated. This great question of the total disappearance of slavery from among them; of that horribly debasing, degrading institution, under which members of their own sex may be purchased—victims in body and soul—ministers to lust and to every brutal passion, for a few pounds sterling, or dollars, or pieces of cloth, or bags of cowries—this question, we repeat, touches them nearly. The position that they and their educated female children may occupy; the greater or less consideration with which they will be regarded and treated, depends in no small degree, on the continuance or annihilation of female domestic slavery. They must—it is inevitable—they must be included, more or less, in the degradation that falls upon their human sisters. We call upon them to regard it as an accursed thing; as striking at the very root of that elevation of themselves in the community, to which their sex has attained in the Christian countries of Europe. We call upon them to look at it as the forbidden spoil in the tent of Achan, bringing a curse upon the whole community to which the culprit belongs. It is quite time that the educated women in Africa, particularly in the British settlements, where they are under the protection of British laws, should make their purifying influence felt in this vital matter. It is for them to cast a halo of purity and of Christian love around; to show in practice as in word, that they love their poorer sisters as themselves. It is only thus that there can be any hope of the purification of African society; any hope of that material as well as Christian advancement, which can alone raise Africa from the degraded position it holds in European opinion; a position owing in no small degree to that abominable slave-trade and slavery, which we call upon them to use their utmost efforts to eradicate.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The available evidence leads to the conclusion that the progress of Islam in Central Africa is more rapid than it is in India.

The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

If the articles given were simply worthless but harmless gew-gaws in exchange for articles of value, the morality of the transaction would even be reprehensible, but how much more when the articles are not only of trifling value ... but often positively destructive.

It is a sad reflection that, in many cases, European commerce has left its African customer as naked as it found him ... they will never secure a footing in Africa for their ideas of civilization, until the commercial relations between the high-toned, enlightened European and the 'savage' African, are placed upon a more equitable basis. But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'. You must, he wrote, 'educate him [the African] by himself. The annals of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society of the Gold Coast in the 1910s and 1920s, notably the speeches of J. E.

Moreover, many African rulers had been able to build empires of varying size only a couple of decades back, and some were still in the process of expanding or reviving their kingdoms. Many of them had been able to defend their sovereignties with the support of their people using traditional weapons and tactics. Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria. As seen above, Menelik addressed a similar appeal to the same monarch as well as to other European heads of state.\nIt is also obvious from some of the quotations above that many African rulers did in fact welcome the new changes that were steadily being intro› duced from the third decade of the nineteenth century since these changes had hitherto posed no threat to their sovereignty and independence. In West Africa, for instance, thanks to the activities of the missionaries, Fourah Bay College had been founded as early as 1827 in Sierra Leone, while elementary schools and a secondary school each in the Gold Coast and Nigeria had been established by the 1870s. Indeed, a call for the establish› ment of a university in West Africa by the Caribbean-born pan-Africanist, Edward Wilmot Blyden had already gone out.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'It was in West Africa that a relatively large number of members of an educated elite had emerged by 1880 and the country that produced the first significant number was Sierra Leone.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Currency and banking', 'content': ""Like the other colonial powers, the British also introduced modern curren› cies into their colonies in place of the traditional system of barter, com› modity currency, and currencies such as gold dust and cowries.

Indeed, the colonial powers went out of their way to promote and encourage the adoption of modern money in three main ways. These, according to Hopkins, were 'by demonetising traditional currencies; by paying [the] expanding labour force in European coin; and by insisting on receiving taxes in cash rather than in kind'. 67 These methods proved very successful and by 1910 European currencies were widespread in West Africa. In the British colonies these consisted of a wide variety of English coins. In 1912, the West African Currency Board was established to supply currencies to British West Africa. In 1913, the Board issued its first coins of the denominations of 2s, is, 6d and 3d and three years later its first currency notes. In British East Africa, the British at first introduced the currency system operating in British India. In 1920, however, one currency board was established to issue coins and notes for the three colonies. It should be noted that all these currencies were linked with sterling in London.\nOne important consequence of the increasing use of currencies was the introduction of banking institutions in British Africa.

The scheme is one for the establishment of an institute for the training of negro girls to be run on lines similar to those followed in the working of the Congo Institute at Colwyn Bay, where young men are educated, trained up in Gospel truths on unsectarian lines, and taught a trade, whereby they can earn their own living by craftsmanship, and impart in their native tongue the knowledge they possess to their benighted fellow countrymen instructing them not only in ethics, but useful trades. Mr. Hughes, the principal, wishes to extend the benefactions to girls, and for this purpose makes an appeal for funds, which it is hoped will be responded to in a manner worthy the cause, not only for the sake of the spiritual leaven, but in the interests of commerce, which such an effort induces and stimulates.\n\nThe scheme of education as carried out at the Colwyn Bay Institute has been found to work most satisfactorily. Among its chief advantages may be pointed out: (1) The boys are taken away from old and injurious surroundings, from old practices, superstitions, temptations, and evil influences; (2) They for four or five years are residents in a Christian country and under new and beneficial influence, and see the benefits of civilisation; (3) They acquire without difficulty the English language, and, indeed, are able to read and study English books and translate them into their native language; (4) The youths are educated to become thorough masters of some handicraft.\n\nIt should perhaps be mentioned that carpentering, printing, tailoring, &c., are taught them free, for the Welsh people have never charged a single apprenticeship fee; and Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co., the great African shippers, convey the students to and from Africa free.\n\nMost successfully has the scheme worked; the boys who have returned to Africa have all done well.

It is being worked up by my wife (Mrs. Ingham), and has for its object the training of educated African women as nurses. We have numbers of women in good position in this colony, but they have as yet found no useful and satisfactory channel for their energies. We have, in the midst of us here, at the same time, gross ignorance and superstition as to the causes and treatment of sicknesses, and it is a common saying on this coast that more people die from want of nursing than from any other cause. Few people in England realise the isolation of Europeans when in fever, and the difficulties attending medical treatment in this climate, where European nurses cannot keep their health. Our scheme will, we hope, alleviate much suffering and save valuable lives.\n\nIt is a modest one. A site is given facing the sea, and the building is to cost about £500. We propose to begin with twelve beds. Two English ladies, it is hoped, will come out to begin the work and to train the African women.\n\nHer Royal Highness the Princess Christian has graciously given the scheme her warm approval.

The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life. At the same time, on every mission in Western and in Southern Africa there have been found native converts who have been deemed suitable to be employed as teachers among their countrymen. Some of these have been honoured of God with great success. It is desired that means may be provided for the training and employment of a much larger number of native African agents; and that at important centres, hereafter to be selected, schools or institutions should be formed for that purpose, to be commenced and sustained by an appropriation from the Jubilee Fund.

If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But besides the establishment of elementary schools, it is desirable for the Government to aid in the establishment of superior colleges for young men and young women in its most advanced West African settlement, Sierra Leone. There is a demand for this; and since the Government has rendered very little help to educational work, it is right for us to expect that it would take up such a work earnestly. The people unaided are unable to provide themselves with such establishments. The practice has been adopted of sending young men and young women to England for education, but it is a very expensive one and is attended with a great risk, and comparatively very few persons can use it. The success that has attended it is one of a doubtful character. Some have returned home with enfeebled constitutions. English teachers have not generally been able to imbue the minds of their African scholars with patriotism, and a sense of their obligations and responsibility to their country. There has been too much of being wrapt up in self. Expensiveness and the fear of their succumbing to the effects of a foreign and trying climate have often necessitated a short stay, and placed them at a disadvantage. Colleges such as I have spoken of will be a boon to the whole Coast, and be hailed with gladness; and if, after successful residence in them, visits are made to England for a finishing, much good will, I think, be done thereby.\n\nIn this matter, as in that of elementary schools for the Gold Coast, the Government will find it most helpful to ask the aid and co-operation of the Church Missionary Society, that has already a very good foundation to work upon.

H. Johnston, Vice-Consul for the Oil Rivers and the Cameroons, read a most telling paper on this subject, which is, unfortunately, much too long for reproduction in our columns _in extenso_, but the following condensed report, we feel sure, will be of interest to our readers:—\n\nThe vast regions which represent the British Empire outside the British Isles come under two categories from the point of view of the political economist. There are those lands which, by their climate and the sparseness of their population, are fitted for Colonisation and exploitation by people of our own race; and there are those in tropical or torrid regions where immigrants of the white race can scarcely hope to make a permanent settlement, on account of the unsuitability of the climate and also from the fact of those lands being already occupied by a numerous native population. In such lands as India, British Guiana, and Western Africa, the object of their absorption into the British Empire is different from that which has actuated the acquirement of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We do not aspire to make them new homes for the British race, but so to govern and control their inhabitants that they (the natives), who, it may be, belong to quite a different variety of man, may be instructed to develop the resources of their country to the greatest advantage to British trade and to themselves. No philanthropy is sound and lasting that is not based on self-interest, and it is only just that, in return for the great work we have carried out in lands like India, we should be rewarded by an increase in our trade with the East, and, consequently, in our national wealth. There is no civiliser like the railway, and to build a railway through an uncivilised country is to centuple existing trade or to create it if none exists; the railway saps race prejudices and dissolves fanaticism. Similar results are attained by the establishment of a line of steamers to the ports of a barbarous country; but what body of philanthropists would construct a railway or establish a line of steamers without some sign that their money and labour had not been thrown away? Consequently we should profit by that instinct that urges us not to rest satisfied with letting rich countries lie idle because the natives are too ignorant to appreciate the advantages with which their soil has been endowed.\n\nWestern Africa is a portion of the world similar in many respects to India. While there are mountainous districts in the interior where European settlers could live and thrive, yet the bulk of the country is unfitted for European colonisation, because the climate is unpropitious and the land already occupied by a sturdy indigenous race.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'GREAT BRITAIN commenced her work of colonising Africa by the foundation of Sierra Leone, more than a hundred years ago: and even her best friends must admit that, except in the regions ruled by the Royal Niger Company, the progress of her influence in West Africa has not been very much to her credit. Doubtless, it must be admitted, that trade has increased—indeed been created between Great Britain and her West African colonies, and Lagos and other ports have been called into being; but yet when we turn to what has been accomplished since 1788 in India, Australasia, Canada, and the Cape, it must be allowed that her work here has, in comparison with that effected in these latter countries—in many cases under circumstances of greater difficulty than have ever arisen on the West Coast—been so dubious in itself, and so unimportant in its consequences as almost to merit the reproach of failure. That there is a great future in store for the Negro peoples no one can deny, who sees how they alone of all the aboriginal races are able to hold their own face to face with the Caucasian, and to increase in ever-growing ratio—like the Israelites of old—in spite of all efforts to cripple them and bind them down, as we see at present in the vaunted Republic of the Western World. But meanwhile it is not encouraging still to see evidence that the Cabinet in London is not always in touch with the requirements and aspirations of the people committed to its charge. In East Africa it is satisfactory to learn that, under the auspices of the British East Africa Company, there is every indication of considerable...\n\n[Nov. 2, 1891.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1891#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown. ""Freetown, with its hills rising behind it, forms a pretty picture from the bay where ships lie at anchor, but the town itself is fairer to behold from a distance than pleasant to inspect closely.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly.
