37,The expulsion of Protestant missionaries from Fernando Po by the Spanish Governor underscores the religious and political tensions between colonial authorities and Christian denominations in Africa.,"The expulsion of Protestant missionaries from Fernando Po by the Spanish Governor underscores the religious and political tensions between colonial authorities and Christian denominations in Africa, as detailed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook notes that in 1858, the Spanish governor declared Catholicism the official religion of Fernando Po, rendering the position of British Baptist missionaries untenable and forcing their relocation to Ambas Bay. This incident highlights the religious tensions between Catholic and Protestant denominations and the political maneuvering by colonial authorities to assert control over religious practices. Similarly, The African Times articles describe how Spanish authorities, influenced by Roman Catholicism, prohibited Protestant public worship and expelled missionaries from the island, which had previously allowed religious freedom under British rule. This led to the relocation of Protestant communities to places like Amboises Bay and prompted British and other Protestant entities to appeal to the Spanish government for religious freedom, illustrating the political and religious friction between colonial powers and Protestant missions. Both sources emphasize the broader themes of religious pluralism, competition among Christian factions, and the colonial authorities' attempts to manage and exploit these divisions for political purposes, reflecting the complex intersection of religious and political dynamics in colonial Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook provides details that align with the claim regarding the expulsion of Protestant missionaries from Fernando Po by the Spanish Governor, highlighting religious and political tensions between colonial authorities and Christian denominations in Africa.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'African traditional religion and colonial rule', 'content': ""What missionaries found particularly abhorrent was female initiation, and they vehemently spoke against it, and the Church of Scotland Mission, African Inland Church, and Gospel Missionary Society prohibited it in their churches in 1920 and 1921. Boys' circumcision among Christians was not as severely interfered with, but the missions required that it should be done in hospitals or private homes. As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end. But the Africans felt that both male and female initiation served a profoundly meaningful purpose in their communal life and that any sudden abolition or prohibition would greatly disrupt their psycho› logical, social and religious security.\nThe African opposition to the negative attitude towards female circum› cision came into the open in the early 1920s, beginning in 1923. For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue. In 1929 a dance song, called muthirigu, which ridiculed missions and Christians who were opposed to female initiation, spread quickly among the Gikuyu but was banned by the British colonial administration the following year. Furthermore African opposition ex› pressed itself in the secession of many members from the Protestant and Anglican churches among the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru peoples. An independent Church, the African Orthodox Church, arose in 1928, while in 1930 a prophetic movement sprang up among the Gikuyu, preaching God's impending judgement upon Europeans and missions, but was quickly banned by the colonial administration.\nAfrican protest continued to express itself in many forms, including disturbances, attacks on mission schools, attempts to prevent preachers from conducting services, and even the murder of a missionary at Kijabe. Combined with the African protest against the missionary attitude to female circumcision was also a growing nationalism which eventually resulted in political resistance against foreign rule.

An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks. When he started a branch of the African Orthodox Church in Uganda, the political and social purpose was clear in his declaration that the Church was '... for all right-thinking Africans, men who wish to be free in their own house, not always being thought of as boys'. Mukasa's church spread to Kenya. Of the same stamp was Jordan Msuma's Last Church of God and His Christ in Nyasaland as were the various African and Aladura churches in West Africa.\nIslam represented a counterpoise to colonial ideology as well as a forum for the expression of messianism. The Mahdï is for the Muslim as the Messiah is for the Christian. Mahdism haunted colonial authorities in North and West Africa, in the Sudan and Somaliland. The Sanüsiyya in Italian-dominated Libya, as we have seen already, presented perhaps the clearest example of the expression of African nationalism and anticolonialism through Islam. Pan-Islamism, the religious side of the culturebound pan-Arabism and the idea of the Salafiya, also played a prominent role in the nationalist and colonial politics in Egypt, the Maghrib and northern Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The Sanüsiyya influence as an anticolonial force spread to parts of West Africa. The colonial authorities found Islamic movements like the Hamalliyya, the Tijaniyya, and Mouridiyya a constant threat to the security of the colonial system.\nThese Islamic movements provided a strong link among adherents who found themselves under different colonial regimes. From the First World War on, as Crowder has shown above,$^{17}$ pan-Islamic ideology being disseminated from Turkey was a worrying issue to colonial authorities in many parts of Africa.

It may seem odd at first sight that people drew ideological inspiration for their struggle against European conquerors from the very religion those conquerors imposed on them. Yet this was precisely the case and is accounted for by various reasons. The first was the character of the old African religions. 'The local traditional religions of tropical and southern Africa - the cults of the early states - were local in character and tended to separate rather than unite', wrote Dr B. I. Sharevskaya, a Moscow student of African religions. $^{12}$ Christianity with its idea that all men are the children of God made it possible for the new converts to identify with a community larger than an ethnic group. Unity on a new basis was possible only in a milieu which marked a departure from the old forms of unity and saw no way of returning to them. The new converts were in just such a milieu. These were, as a rule, people whose break with tradition and prevailing custom was most complete. No wonder anti-colonial protest was accompanied by disenchantment with those who had brought the new faith to them, a disenchantment with the Europeans as genuine Christians and with racial discrimination in the established churches.

(See Fig. 7.1.) In the former, a policy of adaptation was pursued, and it resulted in attempts to modify the jando (male circumcision) and the malango (female circumcision) by performing them under Christian auspices and eliminating whatever elements were thought or judged to be 'un-Christian'. This policy avoided a head-on collision between traditional initiation and Christian missions and practice, even though the Church omitted an essential element in the girls' initiation, namely, the elongation of the clitoris, and thus failed to give malango the type of respectability that traditional initiation otherwise commanded. The Church, however, recognised the need for its' members to be at once Christians and fully initiated members of their communities, and this objective was achieved within the Church rather than in revolt against it. 14 But in the case of the Central Province of Kenya, the missionary policy towards initiation resulted in a head-on collision. The Africans had already begun to feel pressure and to harbour resentment against the British colonial administration for setting vast stretches of their land aside for European settlers. This move also coincided with the activities of a number of missions, for example the Scottish Mission (in Ukambani in 1891 and Kikuyu in 1898), Bavaria Evangelical Lutheran Mission (in Ukambani, 1893), African Inland Mission (in Ukambani, 1896), Gospel Missionary Society (in Nairobi, 1897) and Church Missionary Society and African Inland Mission (in Nairobi, both in 1901), which began to speak against the cherished traditions of the Akamba, Meru, Tharaka, Maasai and other peoples, especially that of initiation using circumcision of both boys and girls.

According to confidential government reports, the Methodist Episcopalian Church, based primarily in Gaza and Manica districts, was a centre of subversive activities. Government infiltrators reported that the Church fostered antiwhite sentiment and explicitly attacked the oppressive colonial regime in its services and at clandestine meetings. Moreover, its officials reputedly maintained links with the African National Congress. ' ° $^{l}$ Other government inquiries found evidence that the Methodist Episcopalian Church advocated revolt and that its members attacked colonial authorities and loyalist chiefs on several occasions. The sect was subsequently accused of helping to organize a major peasant uprising in Mambone in 1952. Such insurgent activities, however, seem to have been the exception. Most independent churches did not adopt an explicitly anti-colonial programme, choosing instead to limit their opposition to verbal criticism and, in some cases, an apocalyptic vision. 102 There are also tantalizing suggestions of Islamic revisionist movements in northern Mozambique whose Muslim population had historically opposed colonial rule. In the 1920s Islamic holy men protested against the abuses of forced labour, low wages, and land appropriation in the area of Quilemane. A number of Muslim chiefs and their followers were also involved in uprisings in the early 1930s but the exact cause of the revolts remains unknown. 103 Urban intellectual protest, although not as deeply rooted in Mozambique as in Angola, nevertheless became an important forum for reformist dis- course. The first, somewhat tentative, call for change came in 1908 with the publication of the Lourenço Marques newspaper, O Africano, the official organ of Gremio Africano (African Union) - a social and civil group founded by the grande familias of colour two years earlier. Despite their relatively privileged position and their self-conscious sense of importance, the leading families of Gremio Africano took as their mandate the responsibility to speak for the oppressed Africans. Indeed, the masthead of O Africano boldly proclaimed that it was 'Devoted to the defense of the native population of Mozambique'.

Peasant flight was particularly common in the northern and eastern regions which remained effectively outside Lisbon's control. Such withdrawal could go on for years without being detected.\nThe third solution was even more radical for it was to all intents and purposes final.

In essence then, as Ogot has observed, 10 Owalo was not rejecting alien religions: he merely wanted the Africans to accept them on their own terms.\nEqually exciting was the message the Watchtower Church delivered to the Africans in Central Africa and southern Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in the years during and after the First World War: the world was in its last age; the great empires and nations of Europe were the instruments of Satan; so too were the historic churches. All these were to be overthrown in one last great struggle. The world would then become the inheritance of the true believers.

The colonial state, fearing its popular appeal and the resurgence of Bakongo nationalism, made a serious effort to suppress Kimbanguism in 1921 and 1922. Despite their efforts an underground network continued to operate and - as in the Belgian Congo - Kimbangu acquired an aura of martyrdom after his arrest. 70 Other more obscure sects surfaced such as Maiaigni, which was detected in the Cabinda enclave in 1930 and the short-lived Cassongola movement among the Mbundu between 1924 and 1930. Kitawala also spread from the Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia into eastern Angola around 1932. Two years later a prophetess from the Congo linked to Kimbanguism attracted a following in the region of the Pombo, and in 1936 the Mayangi or Nlenvo sect - operating near the Congolese border - forbade all its members from fraternizing with whites. Although the data are extremely fragmentary, these religious expressions of protest seem to have had a minimal impact. Only in the 1950s with the advent of Tokoism did an independent Church attract a large permanent following. And Tokoism exhibited contradictory tendencies portraying white colonialists as evil yet preaching passivity. 71 While most of these protests were rurally based, assimilated intellectuals and journalists in Luanda and Lisbon spoke out against the abuses of colonialism and reaffirmed their Angolan identity. Indeed, a very rich tradition of literary protest dates back to the middle of the previous century. The best known of these proto-nationalists were the canon Antonio JosØ de Nacimento (1838-1902), the lawyer and journalist JosØ de Fontes Pereira (1838-91), the writer Joaquim Dias Cordeiro da Matta (1857-94)$^{ a}$°d possibly the members of an association formed in connection with a virulently anti-colonial work entitled Voz d'Angola clamando no deserto published in Lisbon in 1901.$^{72}$ The collapse of the monarchy"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in East Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Religious protest movements', 'content': ""Equally significant, and the second strand of religious resistance, was the emergence of Christian independent churches. As we have seen in Chapters 12 and 20, some of these churches played the role of protest movements against European patronage in the missionary churches; all of them had the aim of going beyond the missionary churches and offering solutions which they believed to be positively good for the communities they served. Yet having stated this common purpose of the independent churches, it is important also to identify the many varieties that emerged in East Africa in this period. Some were 'Ethiopian' churches in that they emphasized, as K. Asare Opoku has pointed out already, African selfimprovement and political rights. Yet others belonged to the 'Zionist' school, with their emphasis upon possession by the Holy Spirit, upon healing, and upon prophecy. More than this there were differences between the independent churches with regard to doctrine, ritual, organization and aspirations. These differences are best identified as the narrative on independency flows.\nThe earliest independent African Church in this region, the Nomiya Luo Church, founded in 1910 by John Owalo, a former Church Missionary Society adherent who had been converted in turn first to Islam and then to Roman Catholicism, has already been dealt with in Chapter 7 of this volume.$^{9}$ It may be recalled that he had a vision in which he was taken to Heaven, and of this place it has been written that: It is a beautiful place; and all the nations of the earth wanted to enter in but the Angels closed the gate.

By some strange oversight when the island was restored to Spain there was no promise asked that this freedom of worship should be continued to the people. The result was that the Protestant missionaries were compelled by the Spanish authorities to discontinue their services. Some of their flock went with them to Victoria (Ambas Bay). The residue, and the Sierra-Leone and other British Protestants who reside in the island for purposes of trade, have from that time been deprived of the public exercise of their religion.\n\nSince the late changes in Spain one of the missionaries from Victoria visited Fernando Po, believing that the freedom of religious worship proclaimed in Spain extended to all her colonies.

Our esteemed friend, Mr. Chamerovzow (for whom we made an appeal last month, which we now renew, and desire to press on the particular attention of Africans), being in Madrid, and believing, as we did, that the prohibition of worship by his Excellency the Governor of Fernando Po was not in conformity with the spirit and intentions of the present Spanish Government, we entreated him to render a new service to Africans by applying to that Government for a decree or order to the Governor of Fernando Po, to allow entire freedom of religious worship. Our friend entered, as we knew he would, with ardour into our views, and urged upon the Minister for the Colonies the consideration of the hardship under which the Protestant Christians of Fernando Po now laboured in being prohibited the exercise of public worship, soliciting also the decree or order above mentioned. The Minister for the Colonies expressed his deep regret that by an oversight Fernando Po was not included in the decree which gave this freedom of worship to Cuba, Porto Rico, &c., and stated that a decree was in preparation, which would be promulgated after the necessary formalities, for regulating that and other matters in Fernando Po. Our friend Mr. Chamerovzow stated, in continuation, that those necessary formalities might, however, occupy several months; and recommended some petitions from England to the Spanish Government on the subject. On consideration, however, it appeared to us that the more efficient course would be to move the British Government in the affair, and obtain an application from this Government, through the Ambassador at Madrid to the Spanish Government, in favour of a speedy bestowal of this boon of freedom of public worship of the Africans and others at Fernando Po. We are now pursuing this course, and hope it will lead to a speedy realisation of the desires of the Protestant Christians in the island. We always considered the British Government to have been greatly in fault in not having obtained for them the promise of this freedom of worship when they gave up the island to the Spanish Government; and are further of opinion that the fact of many of the Protestant Christians in Fernando Po having been made such under the labours of British ministers of the Gospel when the island was under our rule will give additional force to any application that may be made by the Earl of Clarendon, through Mr. Layard, to the Spanish Government on the subject.

If there be abuse of power, there is also redress; and public opinion is a power known and felt in British settlements. An officer has only to go beyond his legal powers to find himself reported to his Government, and his doings criticised in your columns, or it may be, in those of the leading papers of your metropolis. Where can such a thing happen with regard to any other colony? The dwellers under British authority no doubt have much to complain of, but they have also very much to be thankful for. Look at us here. Our usual Governor in his own country would doubtless be considered a very ordinary person in his private capacity, but here he has little short of the power of an absolute monarch, and the arrogance of an upstart. Who is there to call him to account? The people are dumb, and through fear of his power to injure them, and being an English-speaking people without sufficient knowledge of their government, are helpless to make their complaints heard. He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure. He is greatly prejudiced against the English, and this will account for the great dissatisfaction his conduct gives to an English-speaking people. He understands English, but no English will he have spoken. People who have aught to say to him, must say it in Spanish. Instances of his injustice are not hard to find. Proved thieves he has allowed to escape without punishment, whilst an innocent girl is suffering imprisonment for a cause which raises the character of that girl to a point worthy of our greatest admiration. There is hardly a man in the town who has not a grievance against him, and, like others before him, the illicit influence of abandoned women helps to govern. Our Governors have an idea that anything they do here, being in such an out-of-the-way corner of the globe, will not reach the ears or eyes of those whose opinions they fear and appreciate. It is time to let them know that such is not the case. You have done good service to the whole of the Coast in helping to reform official abuses, and although this place belongs to a foreign Power, your sympathies, I believe, are African, and therefore not confined to the settlements of your own country, and have an influence beyond them, more than even suspected by yourself."", 'last_edit_date': '1878-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1878#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Out of this large and noble band of about forty-three, two only at present labour in the mission here, one white, who has just left last month on a visit to England, and one black. Since that time individual missionaries have been sent out at different intervals both from England and Jamaica. But missionary operations at present are totally insignificant compared with what they were in those times. The once flourishing mission on Fernando Po has been broken up since May, 1858, when Don Carlos Chacon\'s royal decree declared Popery to be the only religion tolerated there. A safe and quiet retreat on the continent was sought out and found, a piece of land was purchased of King William of Bimbia, seven miles from that place a small Christian settlement was commenced, named Victoria (August, 1858), and a little remnant of the broken-up church transferred to it, which remnant has been made the basis of operations, upon which a new church is now growing at a moderate pace, under the pastorate of a black missionary, who, beside his various ministerial duties, conducts a fine and flourishing day-school. Bimbia Station, seven miles from Victoria, had been almost entirely deserted. That bright light which had once burned there had about this period dwindled down to a mere spark, and would have gone out entirely but for the blessed influence of the Gospel at Victoria. Cameroons is at present the head-quarters, nominally so. The effects of missionary operations here have been in a great measure rendered ineffectual by internal discords in the church and ministry, some of which have manifested themselves in a manner which reflects anything but credit on the mission cause. Party spirits have been fostered, dissensions have been created, one especially of a most direful tendency had nearly ruined the church. It may be asked, ""What could be the cause of all this?"" Why, because the members of the church here are wholly uneducated and incapable of reasoning for themselves, and on these accounts can easily be turned about to advantage or disadvantage as the case may chance to be. Does not this circumstance reflect some disgrace on the Baptist Missionary Society, that during more than half a century\'s labour in Africa it has not been able to train up one single teacher, either in Africa or in England, capable of taking a common day-school under his own care and supervision? From Fernando Po parents have been obliged to send their children to the Church Missionary Grammar School at Sierra Leone for education. In Cameroons here the missionaries have been obliged to employ young men as teachers who can, with much difficulty spell through a verse or a paragraph, and with equal difficulty scribble a line in the most illegible hand possible, at the rate of 21l. average per annum, on the just ground that their capabilities do not entitle them to a higher salary. They have been enjoined to put aside all their other duties and attend only to those of the mission. They have promised compliance, and what has been the consequence? Their wages being so very small for the support of their families, and living so very hard, they have been unfaithful to their promise, and have clandestinely engaged either in carpentry or in the oil trade, in some instances in both. At present there is not one of them in the mission employ; they have either been dismissed or have resigned, with a view to better their circumstances otherwise. Teachers are badly wanted, and on two occasions teachers have been applied for and obtained from Victoria School (credit to the conductor of that school) for stations up here, with scarcely any remuneration beyond their feeding.

Fernando Po, which had lost the sweetness of the Gospel of Christ for upwards of eleven years, has now been allowed it again. She is now furnished with three able missionaries from the Primitive Methodist Connexion in England, two of whom are for its metropolis and the other for a very beautiful part of Fernando Po called North-West Bay, very splendid for an English settlement. A temporary chapel has been occupied, and a day-school has been established. The day-school is increasing by degrees, and, under God's protection and blessing, is making a very rapid improvement. Thank God, Mr. Editor, that from what we see of the school at present there is nothing to be complained of. The school is governed by the two able young men from that blessed peninsula of Sierra Leone who gave themselves entirely to that mission to work for God. We wish that the people of Sierra Leone will pray for these their children. We also hope that by God's grace all the hidden part of this vast island will enjoy the light of the Gospel. Truly, Mr. Editor, if Africa is ever evangelised it will be by her own sons. From the state and from what I study of the town at present, I can say with confidence that nothing can bring a degraded country to a state of civilisation but the Gospel of Christ. Christ's Gospel is bringing Fernando Po to a state of civilisation, especially its capital, Santa Ysabel, the seat of government, and the place where all business transactions are carried on. Allow me to lay an open question to the public. What do the public think will bring the inhabitants of the interior to Christianity? I, for my part, say that nothing but prayer, and I believe that God, who has brought the inhabitants of Madagascar to his fold, will surely bring them. We hope that from the Primitive School at Fernando Po young men will be raised, by God's grace, native pastors, who will have in time to come the field in which to work."", 'last_edit_date': '1871-06-26', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1871#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: The New Crusade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Of all the European Powers, Germany is perhaps the most harsh and tyrannical in its dealings with native tribes, and yet the Government of that country has the effrontery to appeal to the ""sacred principles of humanity and Christianity"" in justification of its filibustering raid in Eastern Africa. With equal audacity, a French Cardinal has been preaching a crusade of wrath and vengeance in the name of the Prince of Peace, and calling upon Christendom to unite in sending the fiery cross of blood and slaughter amongst the Arabs in Equatorial Africa. The Pope, too, has lent his countenance and support to this bellicose expedition, although he would, no doubt, tell us that the weapons of his warfare are not carnal but spiritual. Then Britain must needs join in the attack by blockading the coast for the benefit of Germany. It may be asked, What all these armed and warlike proceedings are about? Ostensibly for the suppression of the slave trade, but in reality, for the exploitation of Africa in the interests of European capitalists, speculators, and land grabbers. Religious jealousy inspires many of those modern crusaders, for whose encouragement the holy Father will, no doubt, promise the same reward as his predecessors did to the zealots who attempted to wrest Palestine from the Saracens. An eminent traveller has lately borne testimony to the self-sacrificing life and labours of the Arab missionaries in the Dark Continent. Like the early apostles, they go forth without money, scrip, or change of raiment; entering the villages with the salutation of peace, fraternizing with the natives, and dwelling amongst them as friends and instructors. Under their trading whole tribes have abandoned their hereditary fetish worship, their human sacrifices, their cannibal feasts, their abominable obscene rites, and become converts to the faith of Abraham and Mohammed. Whilst Islam thus exerts such an elevating and beneficial influence, it cannot be denied that the African becomes almost always worse for his intercourse with European traders. For every native who falls a victim to the slave trade, how many are consumed by the more accursed liquor traffic, by the vile, poisonous, maddening concoctions introduced by Germans and Englishmen, who talk in such a sanctimonious manner of the ""sacred principles of humanity and Christianity?"" The Arab slave dealer may kill the body, but is not able to kill the soul; whilst this European spirit-seller sends both body and soul to perdition. Again, the captive African, in trading Arabia, is set free when he embraces Islam, and treated as a man and a brother, for ""all true believers are brethren."" In many cases he rises to the highest offices of State, his race and colour being no impediment to his advancement. In what part of Christendom would the same toleration be displayed? The descendants of those who robbed the poor of their patrimony in Reformation times would be horrified at the idea of a negro filling the position of Cabinet Minister, however grand his abilities might be. The professed abhorrence of English society for the institution of slavery can be estimated at its right value by those who remember the sympathy exhibited by the British nobility and gentry for the slave owning oligarchy of the Southern States during the Rebellion. The evils of Arabian slavery are not so bad as those resulting from the system of modern capitalism, and the trade itself is often an obstacle to the capacity of European adventurers, greedy for cheap labour, cheap ivory, and markets into which to shoot cheap home-made goods.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-12-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1888#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Cottage, Fernando Po, August 8, 1874.\n\nSir,—A most brutal murder has been committed here at about 11 a.m. on Sunday last, the 2nd inst., just at the time the meeting of the United Methodists was dispersing, when a man, a native of Gaboon, and a subject of Spain, was stabbed to death instantaneously. This poor victim had been out in the morning to receive his wages from a Spanish gentleman, and returning home, report reached him of his wife being in a neighbouring house where some vicious acts were going on; he at once went to the very house and found things as reported.

There I could hear nothing but the war cry. Every man I approached on the subject of Christianity would answer me something about the war. I said to a great many persons that they ought to throw away their gods, serve the Great God, and become Christians, but they would generally say, ""We will see about it after the war is over."" The great multitudes scorn the cause of Christ, and serve their idols. I went with a friend to Porto Novo, a city about the same distance from Lagos as Abeokuta. The city and its country have a population of 90,000. Soon after our arrival we went to salute the King (Tofa). We found him to be a very intelligent-looking man. We told him that we came to see if he would allow us to come and live in his country, build a school and chapel, and teach his people the Christian\'s religion. He said he only knew two religions—viz., the Wesleyans and Catholics; those were enough, and he wanted no other religion in his country. We attempted to tell him that we all taught the same religion, but he soon stopped us by saying, ""I have no more to say on the subject."" He is a great tyrant, and much devoted to his gods. Just a few days before we went there he sacrificed twenty human souls to his gods. He has about three hundred wives, and told us that he had a very strict law, which prohibited us speaking to any woman or girl, as they were all his wives there. When we meet a woman or girl, we must give half of the walk and not touch them. He had a bottle of beer and lemonade brought for us to drink. After a little more talk we took a glass of lemonade and left with the understanding that we could look at his town if we let the women pass. On leaving his palace we noticed in his yard some half-dozen or more gods. These gods are to be seen by the thousands. Many of the heathen temples are decorated with human skulls, which have been offered as sacrifices to the gods. In one of these temples I counted as many as thirteen. I saw a dog that had been killed, no doubt as a sacrifice, and tied to the neck of one of the gods in the market. A German merchant there had one of the native boys to steal some money from him. He took him to the King to be punished for the deed. The King said, ""All right; I will try by one of my gods; if I find him to be guilty I will punish him."" The merchant said, ""I don\'t believe in your fetishes."" ""What,"" said the King, ""you don\'t believe in my gods!

The report having been read by the Secretary, the Rev. John Milum, his Excellency gave an interesting address, not soon to be forgotten by those who were present. He dwelt minutely on the topics of the report; and amongst many other subjects which his Excellency alluded to, there are two which had particularly occupied the serious attention of the audience. First, he alluded to the disunion and differences between the Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Methodists at Abeokuta (as stated in the report). His Excellency expressed his deep regret and sorrow for the existing misunderstandings between Christian ministers, whose duty is simply to preach Christ, and Him only. If my memory serves me rightly, his Excellency\'s words were as follows: ""When unfriendly terms exist between two Christian denominations that have one object in view, one end to gain, it is much to be lamented, especially in a heathen country. May He who rules and governs all things direct His servants who are engaged in evangelizing the heathen to labour in unity, as their Exemplar, who, whilst on earth, lived in peace and love with all men!"" Secondly, his Excellency returned his sincere thanks to the kind friends who have supported the Missionary Society with their liberality, in subscribing their pounds, shillings, and pence; since, although there has been much commercial depression, arising from the threatened war in the interior of the Yoruba country, yet the annual subscription, class, and ticket-money exceeds that of last year. It will not be out of place to state that the nature of this year\'s report of the Wesleyan Missionary Anniversary Meeting, comprising Lagos, Porto Novo, and the Popo country, is of a twofold character, viz., encouraging in a numerical and financial point of view, and discouraging in deed, for the misunderstanding between the two above-named denominations, and for which reason it is stated in the report that ""the day of grace is past for the Egbas."" Yet we pray God in His mercy not to inflict upon the Egbas the tribal feeling of the ministers, these heathens being ignorant. The Rev. J. B. Thomas gave a short address on the vote of thanks to the Chairman for the able manner in which he had conducted the proceedings of the meeting. The Rev. J. B. Thomas alluded to the report on that one point, that he differed in toto with the Secretary, ""that the day of grace is past for the Egbas,"" and adduced reasons for the impossibility of such a thing, which reasons were satisfactory, and accepted by all who were present.

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary. He has mistaken his vocation.

If our reason is the Society reason for removing Johnson, we say it is done from love; but if from any other motive, we question the dealings of the Society towards Johnson in this matter; for he should, at all events, have been previously made acquainted with his recall, and not by surprise, as the Society took him. For what is Johnson now but a scapegoat between the Christians of Abeokuta and the Society? for he is neither loved by one, nor protected by the other.

We think that if they did otherwise they would betray their high mission. The Bishop\'s Christianity is beyond our comprehension. It must be remembered that there is no difficulty in getting rid of their surplus wife-slaves. The parents are only too willing to receive them back, provided there be not any return demanded of the cattle that had been paid for them. But in a British colony—especially where, as in Natal, the natives are refugees, who have fled from otherwise certain destruction, and found refuge there—this task ought not to have devolved upon the missionaries; the evil ought long since to have been arrested by the Government. It is most disgraceful that it has not been so arrested. The colonists would certainly have effected this, if they could have obtained the consent of the superior authorities in Downing-street. When, in the numbers of our journal before alluded to, we exposed and commented upon the awful atrocity of torturing those young female Kafirs to death by slow fire at the stake, we foolishly believed that before another twelve months should have passed away the British Government must have taken decided action in the matter. We did not believe that the advocates of polygamy and its inseparable atrocities in such countries as in Africa were so numerous in this Christian land, or that those who are not its advocates would remain so seemingly indifferent to its protected and supported existence in a British colony. We again urge the consideration of this question on the Government and a Christian public, with the view to immediate action. As the British Government have so long culpably permitted and protected this polygamy in Natal, we do not urge any violent measures. We have before pointed out what we think ought to be done, in the following words, which state at the same time the position and the remedy (February 23, 1864): ""Everywhere in native Africa, though the regulations may in some degree vary, power and wealth make themselves almost sole masters of the female portion of the community. In Natal, a British colony—a Christian colony—polygamy has been necessarily in some degree modified. The Kafirs both in and out of the colony differ, too, from the slave-trade worried populations of other parts of Africa. There are many possessors of property in cattle, &c. Where the female children do not become the property of the chief, they are sold for the most part to some possessor of cattle. The hard labour of the Kafir kraals or villages falls to the lot of these women, who are in all respects slaves—hard-worked, abject slaves. And it has long since been recognised in Natal that there is danger to the females among the European community, in consequence of that monopoly of the Kafir women which results from polygamy among the Kafirs. Many atrocious outrages that have been committed seem to be traceable more or less to this cause. The Europeans are uneasy in presence of this abomination. They desire most earnestly to be rid of it. And the late burning of Kafir girls, who dared to have affections and a choice, has increased this desire. But the colonists are powerless to influence the Government at home. Shall not we, then, help them? Will Christian England, now that this enormity in one of her important colonies is clearly made known to her, rest apathetic and indifferent? We say that the two systems, the Christian and the heathen, cannot remain thus face to face with each other, and both maintained and upheld by the Home and Colonial Governments. What we contend for is this: The Government are about to distribute 1,250,000 acres of land in the colony among the Kafirs there. The grants are to be free grants for ever of about twenty-five acres each, to all the adult Kafirs. The Governor of Natal is to be trusted of the lands, so that none of them can ever be alienated without his approval. We contend that the time has now come for the Government, in making this distribution of land, to say that polygamy, an agent of confusion in the colony, shall not be further extended; that, without touching any existing ties, the Government forbid any more polygamic marriages among the Kafirs; and that the land shall descend to the issue of the one wife. There can be no doubt as to the power of the Government to enforce this Christian law, which will be far from unpopular among the great body of the Kafir refugees. But whether unpopular or not, they should be made to submit to it. They are there to receive protection, not to dictate religion or polity. The moral and material progress of the colony, and the reputation of this Christian country, all demand the change. We look, therefore, to Parliament to bring the power of Christian public opinion to bear upon Her Majesty\'s Government in this matter, and to insist upon a limitation of polygamy in the colony of Natal, with a view to its speedy extirpation.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Williams is also known to have become involved in the Diamond Jubilee Celebration of Liberian independence, when, at the behest of President Barclay, he took up in 1907 the cause of New World emigration to Liberia.\nUnquestionably, however, it was the three Pan-African Congresses, following Williams' conference, convened by W. E. B. Du Bois in various European capitals (Paris, 1919; London, Brussels and Paris, 1921; London and Lisbon, 1923) which dominated the organized pan-Africanist move› ment. Du Bois himself, in turn, dominated these next three Congresses. He convened the first in Paris in 1919, while in France to cover the Paris Peace Conference for The Crisis, to collect information for a proposed 'History of the American Negro in The Great War'; and to lobby for the political rights of 'the Darker races living within the U.S. as well as throughout the rest of the world'.$^{52}$ Among the resolutions adopted at the Paris Congress in 1919 was a resolution calling for self-determination for Africans."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': ""or hindrance of foreigners. Blyden concluded: During all the years which have elapsed since the commencement of modern progress, the African race has filled a very humble and subordinate part in the work of human civilization. But the march of events is developing the interesting fact that there is a career before this people which no other people can enter upon. There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ... Preach this doctrine as much as you like, no one will do it, for no one can do it, for when you have done away with your personality, you have done away with yourselves ... the duty of every man, of every race is to contend for its individuality to keep and develop it ... Therefore, honour and love your Race ... If you are not yourself, if you surrender your personality, you have nothing left to give to the world .. . 47 Another great leader of the intellectual revolution of the time was undoubtedly that fiery Yoruba-Creole evangelist, James Johnson (c. 18361917). Like Horton, he was born and educated in Sierra Leone at the Freetown Grammar School and Fourah Bay College and taught in that institution from i860 to 1863.

He believed that there should be an independent African Church that would abolish all sectarianism, embrace all African Christians \'and make of them all one African whole\'.$^{50}$ He insisted that the African Church was to be staffed at all levels by Africans since \'European missionaries could not identify themselves with African racial ambitions and idiosyncracies\'. Indeed, he argued that the European presence would prevent the full development of Africans by destroying such qualities as \'the superior physique, the manly independence, the courage and bravery, the daring and self-reliance, and the readiness to face difficulties\' found among Africans who had not come into contact with Europeans."" When he was accused in 1881 of being antiwhite, Johnson replied: With the missionaries of the present day an independent thought in an African and a clear enunciation of his convictions are a great crime. He has no right to them: he must always see with other people\'s eyes and swear by other people\'s opinions: he must not manifest any patriotic sentiments; he must denude himself of manhood and of every vestige of racial feeling and fling away his individuality and distinctiveness to make peaceable existence with them possible and secure favourable recommendations to the Society. 52 In the light of such views, is it surprising that the European missionaries became so scared of him and engineered his removal from the interior of Yorubaland in 1880.\nSimilar intellectual activities went on in other parts of Africa especially in Angola and, as will be seen below, in Egypt and the other Barbary states as is evident from the writings of Egyptian scholars, such as Shaykh Rifâ\'a al-Tahtäwi (1801-73.)""', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': ""In West Africa, however, the educated elite did not stop short at political action. They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'It was in West Africa that a relatively large number of members of an educated elite had emerged by 1880 and the country that produced the first significant number was Sierra Leone.

Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies.

But for reasons to be discussed later, the British had killed this bold and interesting initiative stone-dead by 1873. 59 A similar constitutional experiment was that of the Egba United Board of Management formed at Abeokuta. According to Africanus Horton, its express purpose was that 'of directing the native government, of forwarding civilization, and promoting the spread of Christianity, as well as of pro- tecting the property of European merchants and British subjects'.$^{60}$ A third example was the constitution for the kingdom of the Grebo, which, as Person points out, was set up in imitation of the Fante Confederation.\nIt should be evident from all this that in the political as in the religious and demographic fields, really fundamental changes were taking place and the roots of many of the basic issues of today - the relationship between the educated elite and the traditional rulers, the problems of socio-economic development, the idea of political independence, the concept and practice of pan-Africanism and the phenomenon of racial discrimination - can be found during the period under review."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""In discussing the growth of European interest in the area of West Africa under review, it is useful to distinguish between two phases: that of freedom of movement for the European powers involved up to 1861 when Lagos was annexed to the British Crown, and the succeeding era of international rivalry between France and Britain with Germany entering the competition in the 1880s. This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port.

'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': ""The ultimate decline of Britain's advantage had nothing to do with developments in the periphery of the world-economy.

It was necessary that England should show its sympathy with what had been done by his Majesty and those who co-operated with him.

There was a large attendance.\n\nThe Lecturer, after observing that one of the most remarkable features of the century had been the phenomenal interest displayed in all things African, and that people\'s imaginations had been touched by the varied story of the Dark Continent, drew attention to the apparently unselfish form of the public interest manifested in Africa. The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OUR THIRD VOLUME.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Non ego, sed gratia Dei.""*\n\nIn commencing our Third Volume, we hope we shall be considered justified in saying that our promises have been fulfilled.

If we have checked some evils, prepared the way for the removal of others, and effected some real good, we regard these results as merely the first stones in our structure of African improvement. We receive from so many quarters in Africa the gratifying assurances that this journal is exercising great power for good, that we now claim from the friends of Africa, as a right, that support which we first solicited, in hope that we might possibly advance by our labours the great cause of the industrial regeneration of Africa. It is not too much to say that we have prepared the way for those commercial companies which are now coming full of promise into the great field of undeveloped African commerce.

The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land."" Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country.

Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade.

And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe.

The advance of religion, of civilization, and of commerce were all involved in the opening up of Central Africa, and it was on that account that they appealed to that meeting, and to the greater public beyond, to take into serious consideration how much had been done in that direction in the last twenty-five years, and how great was the promised harvest if they joined in the great movement which was now going on. He moved, ""That the commercial interests of this country are to a large extent involved in the development of intercourse and legitimate trade with the outports to the fertile but little known regions of Central Africa; and, therefore, that the scheme of thorough exploration proposed by the African Exploration Fund Committee deserves the warmest support of this meeting, as powerfully tending to secure that end.""\n\nCaptain CAMERON seconded the motion. He said Africa was the most fertile country in the world. They had heard of the Spice Islands, but here was a spice continent. In Africa there was a great deal more produce than the people could possibly consume. As an illustration of how a trade might grow, he might mention that in 1875 the exports of India-rubber were of the value of 40,000l., in 1876 100,000l., and this year it was expected they would be 250,000l. The great difficulty was the means of communication, but all difficulties might be removed by systematic exploration, and the establishment of stations. The slave-trade was more horrid in its effects than any one who had not witnessed them could conceive. He had known whole villages destroyed, and 500 or 600 people driven into the jungle to perish of starvation or be destroyed by wild beasts, in order to procure 50 or 60 slaves. The slave-trade might be put down by opening up roads and systematic exploration, but it would require a long time to induce the people to abolish domestic slavery, which was so rooted in their habits that if a slave were freed to-day he would complain to-morrow if he were not allowed to have a slave of his own. He hoped that in the course of a few years we should see tramways up to the great lakes, and by using that unparalleled system of lakes the whole of Central Africa would be opened.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WELFARE OF THE AFRICAN RACES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'different countries. People feel jealous of being advised by foreigners; they feel that there is an assumption of superiority of wisdom and virtue; and selfish motives are attributed to the advisers. Now, I venture to think that this objection does not apply in the slightest degree to the meeting to-day. Some eighteen months ago her Majesty\'s Government made a proposal, not that we should go and teach other countries what was to be done about the slave trade, but assuming that all European nations are now inclined to carry out principles which have been proclaimed both by treaty and international communications for some seventy-five years. As against the slave trade, the Government felt that the moment had come when other countries desired to give practical effect to that policy. Lord Salisbury selected perhaps the individual who was best qualified for the duty to preside over the Conference of European Powers. I therefore accepted the invitation to come here with very great pleasure. I received a little shock when I saw in the newspapers that objections were made to our meeting by a society for which I have the very greatest possible respect—that important historical society, the Anti-Slavery Society. It is now more than fifty years ago, very soon after the Aborigines\' Protection Society was established, that I entered office under Lord Palmerston. The strongest political feeling Lord Palmerston had was his horror of the slave trade, and his determination to put it down, and no one who was not in the Foreign Office at the time with him could hardly be aware of the immense amount of energy and labour he devoted to the attainment of that object. Under these circumstances I was naturally in communication with the Anti-Slavery Society—and I have at times been in communication with it ever since. I say that any objection from the Anti-Slavery Society, or any communication from it, would come with great authority. I own that if the objection taken had been that our objects were unworthy, I should have been very much shaken. But it is not so; they agree with us entirely in thinking that this question of the supply of arms to the slave-traders and the question of the supply of alcohol to a great multitude of the African population is one of the most serious and dangerous importance. Their objection rests on a question of tactics. They think that there are two questions already brought before the Conference of vital importance, and that they might be endangered by any other question being raised there at all. But on this question I am not sure that the Anti-Slavery Society speak with greater authority than any other body of men. What is our position here? You have heard the first resolution. Other resolutions to be proposed will set out the prominent causes of the mischief, and the final resolution will be ""That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to his Majesty the King of the Belgians, the president of the International Conference, her Majesty\'s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and her Majesty\'s Minister at the Belgian Court."" There is nothing compulsory in that, and if Lord Salisbury and the King of the Belgians and Lord Vivian are of opinion that no new subject should be brought before the Conference, supposing they think it better to keep these resolutions a little in the background, in what way can our recommendations of today interfere with such a decision? If, they think that these subjects are so closely interweaved that they would not interfere with the general consent of the European Powers. I venture to think that it would strengthen the hands of Lord Salisbury and Lord Vivian, that a meeting under the presidency of the Lord Mayor had passed these resolutions. I said that it was a wise step to ask the King of the Belgians to take the initiative in this matter of the Conference. I think that it is impossible not to recognise why he has the greatest claims and qualifications for the task. In recent years we have seen men of great wealth making magnificent contributions to objects of philanthropy. The King of the Belgians has this pleasant characteristic, but none of the contributions approached in wideness of scope those of the King of the Belgians. We see what he has done, for instance, by the creation of the Congo State. He has not only given time and most anxious care to the affairs of the State—his contributions in a pecuniary sense are perfectly enormous. The official returns show the cost to be about £70,000 a year, and the whole comes from the King of the Belgians, not as Sovereign, but as a private individual from his private means. I have reason to believe that hundreds of thousands beyond that have been spent by him in this great work, and I think it is satisfactory that the King of the Belgians accepted the presidency of the Conference, the object of which is to give practical effect to principles which have really been sanctioned by the whole of Europe for some seventy-five years. I think it is becoming that this meeting we should commence operations by giving a vote of thanks to the King of the Belgians for the part he has taken in this important affair.

They must not if they could, and they ought not even if they wanted. They had laid themselves under an overwhelming load of debt to the African that centuries of beneficial work could never repay, and it would be well if they heard less about high-sounding words, schemes for the suppression of the African slave trade, and more practicable proposals for the stoppage of their equally ruin-working commerce in spirits and weapons of destruction.

They were movements which were emancipatory in character, expressing what is essentially a universal phenomenon in situations in which communities had to express their dissatisfaction with their living conditions and a desire for regeneration. They represented an ideology competing against colonial› ism in so far as the latter represented a negation of indigenous culture and economic, social and psychological depression of the colonized. In the words of Lanternari, 'They reflect the anxieties and hopes of the groups that participate in them for a sudden and total transformation of their physical, social and psychological environment.' 16 Prominent examples of such movements in our period, some of whose activities have been discussed in Chapter 20 above, were Ethiopianism in South and East Africa, and the movement spearheaded by millenarian preachers in Southern and Central Africa, notably the Kitawala (African and Congo Watch Tower) with large following in the Rhodesias, spreading to the Congo (now Zaire) and Nyasaland (now Malawi); the Kimbanguist movement (founded in the Belgian Congo by Simon Kimbangu) with following in Belgian and French Congo and the neo-Kimbanguist Mission des Noirs founded in the Lower Congo by Simon-Pierre Mpadi. Otherwise known as the Khakists, the movement had influence among the population of French Congo and Oubangui-Chari (now Central African Republic). Some of these movements were inspired by their acceptance of Christianity but were disenchanted with the expression of the religion in the organized Church of the colonial societies. African nationalists who were anxious to preserve Africans against colonial oppression found the Church at best indifferent. They therefore broke away very much in the spirit of the Reformation which has been characteristic of the growth and spread of Christianity in many societies.

'The local traditional religions of tropical and southern Africa - the cults of the early states - were local in character and tended to separate rather than unite', wrote Dr B. I. Sharevskaya, a Moscow student of African religions. $^{12}$ Christianity with its idea that all men are the children of God made it possible for the new converts to identify with a community larger than an ethnic group. Unity on a new basis was possible only in a milieu which marked a departure from the old forms of unity and saw no way of returning to them. The new converts were in just such a milieu. These were, as a rule, people whose break with tradition and prevailing custom was most complete. No wonder anti-colonial protest was accompanied by disenchantment with those who had brought the new faith to them, a disenchantment with the Europeans as genuine Christians and with racial discrimination in the established churches.

While the Africans lost the actual wars in the battlefield, the mood of resistance remained entrenched in the hearts of the many. The followers of the Orkoiyot in Nandi remained active and watchful and the Nandi were repeatedly mobilized by this prophetic leadership to resist the abuses of colonialism over the years.$^{4}$ Similarly colonial archives from Kenya are full of references to witch doctors and laibons creating trouble in Marakwet, Kericho and Samburu.

The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric.

An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks. When he started a branch of the African Orthodox Church in Uganda, the political and social purpose was clear in his declaration that the Church was '... for all right-thinking Africans, men who wish to be free in their own house, not always being thought of as boys'.

Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

War-charm movements also occurred in Madagascar and the Congo basin.

The second advent, the adherents of these churches and sects believed, would usher in a thousand-year rule of good and justice, while colonialists would be driven out of Africa. \' 3 Independent churches, both of the Zionist and Ethiopian varieties, were particularly widespread in South Africa and represented an important form of dissent. Their numbers spread rapidly. In 1918 there were seventy-six; by 1932 the number had increased to 320; and a decade later there were more than 800.$^{14}$ From the standpoint of social movements, the separatist Ethiopian churches, with their elected officials, flags, charters and para› military organizations, represented the assertion, within the framework of the Church, of the claim for African self-government.

But though there is no doubt that a land where every man is free is in a better state than where slavery exists to a large extent, yet we must remember that slavery is recognised throughout the Bible, not only in the patriarchal times and under the Mosaic law, but also very distinctly by St. Paul, who lays down the relative duties of masters and servants to the churches of Ephesus and Colosse, and exhorts Timothy to teach the slaves at Ephesus to count their own masters worthy of all honour, especially if their masters were Christians (1 Tim. vi. 1, 2), and sent back to his master, Philemon, Onesimus, who had been converted under his ministry at Rome. St. Paul had fully acknowledged the right of Philemon to his servant, though he thought it convenient for him, as a Christian, to release him, and he insists upon the duty of Christian servants to obey their masters, though he wished them to obtain their freedom if they could (1 Cor. vii. 21). The tendency of Christianity is no doubt to diminish slavery, but it does not do this by exciting the slaves to revolt or run away; on the contrary, it commands them to please their masters well in all things, but it exhorts masters, as it does all other Christians, to do to others as they would they should do to them.""\n\nCotton, with the extremely wet weather, remains scarce, and is readily bought at fourteen strings twenty cowries.\n\nOils exceedingly scarce, with an upward tendency.'}, {'id': 197, 'article_title': 'THE REVOLUTION IN MADAGASCAR', 'full_section_title': 'THE REVOLUTION IN MADAGASCAR', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-7', 'issue_date': '23_07_1863', 'content': '""It was then proposed to assassinate a number of Christians, as a means of stopping the progress of Christianity, and also to kill the chief nobles who opposed the King\'s proceedings.

With the view, also, of shielding the perpetrators of the intended murders, the King announced his intention to issue an order, or law, that any person or persons wishing to fight with fire-arms, swords, or spears, should not be prevented, and that if any one were killed the murderer should not be punished.

Surely, Sir, this is a part of missionary success.\n\nThe English public are also told by Mr. Reade that Mohammedanism is the only religion adapted to those races. Let me ask Mr. Reade what he knows about the religious feeling of the negro? Where did he obtain his information? In what part of the world did he gain his knowledge of negro character? He was a short time at the Gaboon, not more than four months, and at what he erroneously calls Cames. Most of the young men at the Gaboon can both read and write, and seldom does a native from the interior visit the Gaboon, as they do all their trade with trading boats and canoes, which ascend the river. This cannot be a field for pure negro character. At the same time such is the groundwork of Mr. Reade\'s book. Walker\'s book has also been founded upon Gaboon experience. It causes only a smile of contempt when we hear the English public term Reade and Walker, ""African travellers,"" and points out the incompetency of flying authors.\n\nBut to return to the religious feeling of the negro. I can tell Mr. Reade that I am meeting a class of negroes that would be Protestants to-morrow for one pound of tobacco, and the next day turn into Mohammedans for a gallon of rum.

I made arrangements to remain over Sunday, but was somewhat at a loss how to spend the day. But what was my astonishment on the following morning to find in the Palaver House a number of well-dressed people with books in hand for morning worship. In this way the day was spent. Those people had travelled from twelve to twenty miles, to spend the day with a few fellow-Christians belonging to Creek Town church, and at the time I speak were some eighty miles distant; on the following morning they returned to their plantation towns to resume the labours of the week. When I got to the towns at the base of the Qua Mountains I found people connected with the Duke Town church. They brought me food in abundance, and mats to lie upon, and gave me their advice and protection. Those people are spreading the Gospel amongst the inland tribes which never saw the face of white men.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes.""

Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.578, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As to the elevating effects of Islam, hear the evidence of Mr. Joseph Thomson, the African explorer, who writes, he says, ""as one having the interests of Christianity deeply at heart.""

Dealing, first, with European influences, Mr. Thomson says: ""It is a painful fact to admit, but there is no shirking the naked reality, that in West Africa our influence for evil enormously counterbalances any little good we may have produced by our contact with the African."" He deplores ""the small headway Christianity is making, and the aptitude of the negro to adopt all that is evil in the white man.""

At present, it must be confessed, the negro seems to find Islamism the more saving faith. That the Mohammedan negro has reached a more real civilization, a higher stage of education, and a richer mean of material prosperity than his Christian brother is certain. One of the most obvious explanations of this, of course, is that while Arab missionaries have been at work in Africa for many centuries, the effort to Christianize its peoples is of very recent origin. Moreover, the negro Mohammedan has access to an ancient and poetic literature, and he has availed himself of it to a far wider extent than might be supposed. Dr. Blyden thinks that the spread of the English language will have a powerful effect in arresting the progress of Islamism; and he may be right. He is sanguine that Christianity must ultimately be the dominant faith of Africa. That it should be so is apart from purely religious considerations, of vast practical importance, since Christianity alone offers adequate safeguards against the continuance of the slave trade. The particular form of Christianity which will in the end find most favour in Africa matters comparatively little; but Dr. Blyden hints that Roman Catholicism seems to be peculiarly suited to the spiritual needs of his countrymen, who beyond all doubt already owe to it a deep measure of gratitude.\n\nThis book is a valuable contribution to the literature of a fascinating subject, and it is to be hoped that it will receive the attention it deserves.

If our reason is the Society reason for removing Johnson, we say it is done from love; but if from any other motive, we question the dealings of the Society towards Johnson in this matter; for he should, at all events, have been previously made acquainted with his recall, and not by surprise, as the Society took him.

Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence.""

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Accordingly, the European presence on the coast became another unifying factor in the history of the region, presenting common problems and stimuli to change. Thus, each of the communities in the region underwent changes or adaptations in their social, political or cultural structures in the face of the external influences and challenge of European intrusion. The factors of European activity included: (i) the slave trade and the effects of its abolition in the nineteenth century; (2) the change to trade in local produce in place of slaves, sometimes referred to as legitimate trade; (3) the entry of Christian missionaries into the region, and (4) the onset of European imperialism and colonial conquest.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

This approach fails to consider the prevailing circumstances under which various groups or individuals operated.

It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time. Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.\nIn the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation. However, the vast majority of societies in this region did not have centralized governments. But lack of central governments does not imply lack of government, a mistake which some foreigners commenting on African societies have made in the past."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time.

Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'Evidence has been accumulated to show that the nineteenth century wit› nessed major social transformations in Africa, especially in the nature of slavery and through the rise of both a warrior class and a politically powerful merchant class.

More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront.

They found it very thickly populated, and passed villages, or \'towns\' as they are called, every few miles.\n\nmet buffalo and elephant tracks continually, encountering one herd of the former more closely than was at all agreeable. The people were comparatively fearless and friendly, and food was fairly abundant, large gardens in good cultivation surrounding most of the towns. At Bemba they crossed to the northern bank of the Congo, and proceeded on that side to Stanley Pool, reconnoitring the country with a view to the selection of good sites for mission stations. They walked 169 miles, thirty-one of which were on Mr. Stanley\'s road, now nearly overgrown with grass. They had much difficulty in procuring food for their thirty Kroo boys on this side, but, by paying rather highly for it, managed to get a sufficiency. Bwa-bwa Njali, and the other chiefs at the Pool, received them at first in a friendly way, but afterwards, for some unexplained reason, turned suddenly hostile, and refused to let them cross the river, in order to carry out the plan they had formed of returning by the south side. Our friends had reason to suspect the adverse influence was a foreign one, similar to that which opposed Messrs. Crudgington and Bently on their visit. They returned consequently as far as Nkenke River, near which they secured land for a station from the friendly chief of a populous district; cut timber, cleared the ground, and began to build. It was needful, however, to bring up stores from Bemba, to which station, consequently, they returned after a month\'s absence. Letters from home which met them there decided them, before continuing their building near Inkissi, to explore the rest of the south side from Bemba up to Stanley Pool, so as to be in a position to determine by which road it would be best to carry up the steamer for the upper river. They started on this second journey of exploration about the middle of January, Mr. Ingham remaining at Bemba with Mr. Frederickson, and Mr. Lanceley going forward with the pioneer party. We are thankful to add that the health report is far better than usual, both from the travellers and from all the stations, and that the missionaries, each and all, seem full of earnest zeal and holy courage for their difficult work.""'}, {'id': 4526, 'article_title': 'East Central Africa', 'full_section_title': 'East Central Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1882#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_12_1882', 'content': 'Archdeacon Farler writes from Zanzibar, on Oct. 15: ""Letters have arrived showing that a great disaster has fallen upon Masasi and the country round. Maples, after a council with the Masasi chiefs, went out to find the Wagwangwara camp, and to try and make a treaty with them. Unfortunately, he missed them, as they had already set out to attack Masasi by another road. The Wagwangwara broke into the mission station before sunrise. Sellim, an old Zanzibar boy and a promising teacher, was killed, with two catechumens, a man and a woman, from Mbweni, with four children. Finding there was no resistance, the Wagwangwara chief was able to restrain his people from further slaughter. Several others were wounded, but are progressing favourably. The plunderers then seized everything they could lay hands upon. Many escaped to the forest and hills, and others to the mission-house compound, which was fortunately surrounded with a stone wall. They captured about thirty-nine or forty, but Porter succeeded in redeeming some of them as far as his barter cloth went, leaving twenty-three native Christian adults and six native Christian children still in slavery. Porter, by all accounts, has acted with great judgment and tact. He managed to come to an understanding with the chief of the robber tribe, and kept them all out of the mission-house and compound, although several attempts were made to get in for the purpose of stealing. They sacked the church, but when they heard it was the House of God they were afraid, and returned the sacred things and furniture of the church. They encamped for some time near the station, and for many days kept wandering about, but without any further molestations. They did not burn any of the mission-houses, although they have burnt all the villages around. They promised to await in the neighbourhood of Majeje, about sixty miles west of Masasi, for the ransom of the native Christians. The chief said he had power to control his people in fighting, but no power to make them restore captives without ransom. Maples or one of the others will follow the Wagwangwara, and try and recover the captives. We have since heard that the tribe have been resisted or attacked by some people, and they have gone off entirely to their own country. This will make the redemption very costly and difficult, as their own land is just to the north-east of the northern end of Lake Nyassa. Maples has a very bad foot, and probably will be unable to go, and I don\'t know who else would be able to manage it, except Mr. Porter—dear, brave fellow!

Bishop proceeding with 50 men imprisoned; eighth day Uganda messengers returned; all led to execution, four escaped; Jones waited Kavirondo waits caravan two months.""\n\nFrom this it appears that the Bishop was in Usogna, the country immediately to the east of the Victoria Nile, and was imprisoned with his 50 men by the King\'s emissaries, while messengers proceeded to Uganda for further instructions; that on the eighth day of his imprisonment these messengers returned, and the whole party were led out to execution, but that four of them escaped, two of whom seem to have witnessed the murder, and to be now in Zanzibar.

The substance of the statement is appended, but our readers need hardly be reminded that as the name of the missionary is not made public the account must be accepted with much caution. The whole truth, he says, regarding the situation on the Congo can never be made public by anyone who has to return there. The State officers are so far from any central control that if they heard that the missionaries, for instance, had said anything, they would retaliate by attacking the Natives round the stations, even if the white men were not themselves hurt. As to the Stokes affair. I know nothing personally of that incident. I do know Captain Lothaire, however, and therefore was not surprised. He, in common with a few other State officers who could be named, is held in special awe by the Natives. The people on the Lulanga River called him ""Lofembe,"" meaning mist, by reason of his mysterious movements. Lothaire is by no means the worst of the Congo officers, as there are many in the State service who have a still worse reputation among the Natives. The following is a specimen of Captain Lothaire\'s actions. Some four years ago he arrived with some black troops at a point opposite the mission station of Eulongo. Finding the Natives had fled on hearing of his approach, he pitched his camp on an island facing the station, and sent over to the missionary asking him to use his influence to get the Natives back, and promising a three days\' truce in order to hold a palaver. The missionary, supposing he was dealing with an officer and a gentleman, induced the Natives to come into the station. As soon as they did so, Lothaire and his men opened fire on them and killed a number. Naturally, the Natives attributed this treachery to the missionaries, and later, when Lothaire sent word to another mission station that he was about to visit it, the missionary warned the Natives around the station not to return if they were sent for. One important thing connected with the Stokes affair seems to have been overlooked. It is that Stokes had been robbed of a caravan worth £4,000, and it is quite likely that many of the arms found by the State officers on the Natives formed part of the booty. This being so, it is scarcely probable that the people would admit having stolen them, but would be much more likely to declare that they had got them from the British trader. This might happen in the case of any trading or mission station being looted by the Natives, as materials for purposes of shooting game, as well as for defence, are always kept in readiness, including perhaps a thousand cartridges. If these were found on the Natives the State officials might as readily declare that they had got them from the British. This does not affect the action of Captain Lothaire one way or the other, but it throws an important side light on the affair.'}]","[{'document_title': 'BRITISH CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES AND THE WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So entire has ever been our conviction that the rapid or feeble progress, the future good or evil, in West Africa depends on the character of Missionary efforts there, and of Missionary relations with the people, that it has been our constant endeavour to throw the weight of whatever influence we may possess into the Missionary scale. Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary. He has mistaken his vocation. He may be a very good man, he may have high and exalted motives, he may ardently desire the conversion of the heathen; but if human infirmities of mind and temper', 'last_edit_date': '1878-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1878#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Perfectly true, he said, because there was no bright one as seen in the bird's-eye view he had been taking. What was a missionary here and there compared with the thousand agents of commerce who, with untiring and unscrupulous industry, dispensed wholesale the deadly products of Europe? What was a Bible or a bale of useful goods in opposition to the myriad cases of gin—the thousand guns which competed with them? What chance had a Christian virtue where the soil was so suitable for European vice? But he would be presenting to them an entirely misleading picture of the situation if he restricted himself to the distant and general prospect. A closer and more detailed examination revealed many bright points in the night-like darkness of Africa; and of these none scintillated with a more promising light than the enterprises of the Christian missionary. And yet, however promising for the future, when they looked around and saw with what rapid strides the emissaries of Islam had made their influence felt throughout the whole of the Central and Western Soudan, and left the mental and spiritual impress of their civilisation upon the natives, they could not but sadly wonder at the comparatively small headway that their Christian rivals had made against the sodden mass of heathendom. As compared with the good work of Mohammedanism in Africa, Christianity in these lands had been practically a failure. Wherever Mohammedan seed had been planted there it had taken root, and there it had remained to flourish with a vigorous grip of the soil which nothing could destroy. The same could not be said of Christian seed. It had ever been as a delicate exotic, difficult to plant, more difficult to rear, and ever needing outside support and watering. The Mohammedan missionaries had been men like the natives themselves, men who spoke the same language, lived the same life. On the other hand, the Christian worker had accomplished so little because he had tried to do so much. He had seldom comprehended the problems he had had to face. His education has rarely been adapted to the work before him, and filled with much enthusiasm and ardour and more erroneous ideas, he had gone forth too often to do little more than throw away his life with but small result to the cause he had at heart. Before any great advance would be made in the Christian propaganda in Africa a total revolution in the methods of work must be accomplished.

While French and German expeditions were being organised on either side, the Niger Company last winter despatched an embassy to the Sultan of Bornou to find out by personal negotiations what attitude he is prepared to assume towards the entire wave of European influence which is approaching his empire from the west. The expedition, about 300 strong, was under the command of the Company\'s officer, Mr. Charles Macintosh, who had with him a staff of two or three other Europeans; a part of his convoy consisted of the Houssa troops of the Company, and the remainder was made up of porters bearing food and equipment for the party, together with a liberal supply of presents for the monarch whom it was hoped to propitiate. The whole party were fully armed, but their instructions were to regard themselves as a strictly peaceful mission, and to take every precaution to avoid bloodshed. As the country between the Benue and Lake Tchad was unknown, food was taken for the whole journey. A draft treaty between the Niger Company and the Sultan of Bornou was confided to the diplomatic care of Mr. Macintosh to negotiate if possible. The party left Ribago, on the Benue, in October, and struck in a due northerly direction for Kouka. The distance as the crow flies is something less than 250 miles, not so far as from London to Durham. It was traversed at the rate of ten or twelve miles a day, and after three weeks\' travelling, the expedition arrived at the Court of Bornou. Scientific observations of the country were taken on the way. The natives, from whom nothing was requested, were not otherwise than friendly. At Kouka, which is a considerable town, with a population of about 120,000, and regarded as the western terminus of Mohammedan civilisation in Central Africa, the arrival of Europeans created no small sensation. The Embassy was well received by the Sultan, who assigned it quarters in the town, and was pleased to accept as a preliminary to negotiations some portion of the presents which were offered to him. Two months of Oriental dilly-dally followed, during which time the officers of the Company made use of their opportunity to acquire political and commercial information relating to Bornou and its sister States. Arabs from all quarters thronged about them, and the Houssa language, which is the _lingua franca_ of the Central States, served as a medium of communication. Political factions abound at the Court of Kouka as elsewhere; but the result left in the minds of Mr. Macintosh and his companions after prolonged discussion with the various leaders is that all factions unite in a determination to repel the approach of Western civilisation. Bornou draws all its knowledge of the outer world from the reports of pilgrims and caravans travelling to Mecca and other centres of the East. The Mahdist disturbances in the Soudan, which have forced pilgrims to Mecca, to pass by way of Cairo, have had the effect, as regards Bornou, of keeping it better informed than it was before of the progress of the world\'s affairs, and have contributed to weld it and the neighbouring States more closely to the Eastern and Mohammedan as opposed to the Western and Christian system. The power and influence of Senousism in the Central States have not been, so far as the Niger Mission was able to ascertain, in any sense over-estimated by general report. Religious fanaticism supported by the sword is the prevailing spirit of government in Bornou. A well-established current of trade with the East and long-standing political traditions at present serve to combine all interests against European intrusion. It is neither England nor France nor Germany which is feared, but the European as European, the revolution of steam and enlightenment and liberty as against the camel and ignorance and despotism. The persistence of the European is well known, but while he presents himself in the peaceful guise of a trader only arms will suffice to drive him back. There is not a caravan which comes across the desert that does not bring evidence of the fact that, whether in Egypt, or Tripoli, or Turkey, the European, once admitted, reduces the Oriental to submission. The East has but one story. Bornou is of the East, and it stands in the position of a man who has never tasted wine and who sees his neighbour drunk. He realises all the consequences; he has never experienced the force of the circumstances which have produced them. The Sultan of Bornou and his advisers say in their pride, ""The evil has all come from having dealings with the West. We will have no dealings with the West, unless they are imposed upon us by force of arms.""', 'last_edit_date': '1891-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1891#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Missionary Progress in the Eastern Districts of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The annual meetings of both the Wesleyan and the Basle Missionary Societies have been held at Accra.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BIRMINGHAM AND THE BRUSSELS CONFERENCE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Jan. 10 a meeting, at which the Mayor presided, was held at the Birmingham Council House to consider the questions affecting the slave trade and European relations with native races in Africa which are being dealt with by the Conference of the European Powers in Brussels.\n\nThe Chairman explained that the object of the meeting was to adopt a memorial to the Conference at Brussels, which had been convened to consider the best means of suppressing the traffic in firearms and poisonous liquors with the natives of Africa. The question before the meeting was one that claimed the most serious and earnest attention of all Christian nations. The attempt to introduce civilisation amongst the aboriginal tribes in Africa and Australasia had been attended with most deplorable results. The Conference at Brussels afforded an excellent opportunity of bringing before the Powers the feelings of the English people on the subject, not only nationally, but in the various localities. He quite agreed in the terms of a memorial which had been sent to the Conference from London. That memorial was chiefly to the effect that the most stringent laws which could be passed by individual States would be of small avail unless backed up by constant efforts by the representatives of all the different Powers to put down the traffic, which included slaves, as well as instruments of war and poisonous liquors.

Why so? Because ministerial discord and dissension are at the bottom of it. One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Native Races and the Liquor Traffic', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. C.

I was able, however, on my journey to and fro along the coast to make some special investigations with regard to the liquor traffic, and in view of the great urgency of this subject at the present time I venture to offer a few observations on this most important subject. The great difficulty at the present time is the unequal competition of the various political divisions into which West Africa is divided. The low duties, for instance, in force in the German possession of Togoland and that of French Dahomey render the protection of the frontier in each case exceedingly difficult, and at any time this unfortunate state of things may lead to international complications. For this reason I would urge in the strongest terms the necessity for immediate action to be taken to secure international agreement, if only that this undoubted cause of friction may be removed, and that there may be agreement between the Powers who have taken possession of tracts of land in Africa. It can hardly be wondered at that Natives of Africa regard the profession of benevolent intentions which have been put forward with much éclat at the Berlin and Brussels Conferences as, to say the least of it, verging on hypocrisy. . . . It has often been suggested that in appealing for action we are opposing the true interests of British trade. On the contrary, it is clear that in seeking for international agreement as to this matter we are really asking for justice to British trade, as it is well known that Great Britain leads the way in the amount of duty levied on alcohol in the British possessions in West Africa, and Mr. Alfred Jones, of Liverpool, who probably has as much interest in West African trade as any other living man, supported this view strongly at the annual meeting of the Native Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee at Grosvenor House in May last. . . . It is not true, I am thankful to say, that the whole of our West African dominions are utterly demoralised by the drink traffic. Happily the evidence which I have obtained points unmistakably to the fact that only a small part of the territories under our control has been much affected by the spirit trade, as the difficulties of transport render the carriage of spirits far into the interior a difficult matter; but we have evidence that the area is rapidly increasing. With the opening up of roads and the development of railways, and the greater security of travel, drink is finding its way where it had not penetrated before. Now it is in our power to prevent the evils which are too well known in this as in other countries as arising from spirits. In a few years\' time it will be too late if the matter is not dealt with immediately. I cannot close without referring to the splendid stand made by the Royal Niger Company, who, as is well known, have prohibited the import of spirits into the greater part of their territories. From personal experience I know that this is faithfully carried out; and, though some smuggling does occur, in spite of the competition of neighbouring possessions the greater part of Niger is practically free from the evil of the liquor traffic.""', 'last_edit_date': '1897-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit.

A strong effort was made to get that iniquitous abuse abolished. All, however, that the Consul could wring out of the authorities on this point was a verbal promise that henceforth due intimation shall be given to the whole town, by the ringing of the big Egbo bell to give warning that the runners will be out; and, further, that the runners themselves shall always give notice of their approach by sounding the bell attached to their persons.

At this decision the congregation and Mr. Ross\'s numerous friends were indignant, and asked, ""Why, what evil has he done? Let us hear it!""

Next day the Henshaw Town chiefs joined the disruption party. This unexpected step, though pre-warned of it, was very mortifying to both deputies and missionaries having an empty church to preach in. One of the former was very ill after he saw the result of their work, and it hastened, if it did not cause, his death on the voyage homewards (for he died near Grand Canary). There is a coloured missionary from Jamaica, with slight knowledge of medicine, in Creek Town, and the deputies acceded to his wish by sending him to Duke Town to help the other missionaries to entice the people back to the deserted church. He has now been over three months at his work, and has not succeeded in bringing a single individual back to the church. The people prefer rather to pay for Mr. Ross\'s teaching and medicines than to have his for nothing. Before the deputies quitted the African shores, Mr. Ross and his congregation were worshipping in the new church built for them by one of their elders, Prince Eyamba. In addition to this noble work, the Prince heartily gave his own new house to Mr. Ross. The Henshaw Town chiefs are building a handsome church for Mr. Ross and his congregation, to which they intend to remove, and use the present church for a schoolhouse. Mr. Ross is a man of an indomitable spirit, great energy, and perseverance, and, being liberated from the annoyance which he has been unjustly subjected for our sakes for the last five years (qualities which we natives admire), we expect soon the new Mission will equal, if not surpass, the old. Already he has two stations in Calabar, and one inland; and he is just now making arrangements to settle two evangelists next month in virgin soil, where he has obtained mission land from the chiefs, as the first missionary they ever saw; and I am sure, Mr. Editor, as a benefactor of my race, you will wish him God-speed!

They visited Orök, notwithstanding his brothel in the creek and at plantation for married European traders. But we Africans as we are, let the deputies and missionaries know that we can think and act for ourselves, and that we are not so easily trampled upon as they suppose. Mr. Ross informs me that he has written and sent home the whole palaver for publication. There is a lull just now in town affairs.

As European nations increasingly became interested in the acquisition of African territories, the missionaries paved the way in some areas of Africa and served, quite consciously, as agents for European colonialism. Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans. Missionaries therefore enthusiastically encouraged European intervention as a morally justified undertaking, especially from the 1870s onwards."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.746, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': 'Missionary work, during the period under discussion, was in its pion› eering phase. On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': 'In addition to the British consuls and naval officers on the coast, British traders and missionaries tried to get into the hinterland, for example, by sponsoring voyages of exploration. Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century. Dike considered that Christianity turned the slaves into revolutionaries who created upheavals in these states; but recent research has discovered other social and political factors to explain the problems of the delta states in the nineteenth century. 7', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': ""But even more widespread and successful were missionary activities in Southern Africa. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, there were only two missionary societies operating in the whole area. These were the Moravian Mission, which entered the Cape for the first time in 1737, withdrew only six years later and did not return until 1792; and the London Missionary Society, which appeared at the Cape for the first ime in 1799. 10 But from 1816, many societies from Britain, Europe and the USA, Protestant as well as Catholic, entered not only the Cape, but also Natal and the Transvaal. By the 1860s, they had penetrated as far north as the areas of modern Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Zambia. These societies included the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the Glasgow Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society, the Norwegian Missionary Society, the United Presbyterian Mission, the Berlin Society, the Rhenish Society, the Paris Evangelicals, the USA Mission to Zululand and Mosega, the Hamburg Missionary Society and the Swiss Free Church. 11 One of the interesting differences between the missionary enterprise in Southern Africa and that in, say, West Africa was the direct and active way in which European missionaries became involved in political affairs in the former area and, above all, the close relationship that came to exist between some of the missionaries and some of the African kings. Right from the beginning, missionaries like J. T. Van der Kemp and John Philip actively participated in politics while Lobengula, Lewanika and Cetshwayo became the great friends of Robert Moffat, François Coillard and Bishop John Colenso respectively. 12 At first, it used to be believed that the missionaries in South Africa were always on the side of the Africans and always championed their cause. Recent work has, however, emphasized that they were 'frequently employed as negotiators between colonial and African authorities, as diplomats rather than evangelists', and that though the colonists regarded them as danger› ously pro-African, many African leaders (with greater justification) regarded them as dangerously pro-settler and pro-imperialist. 13 These missionary societies did not restrict their activities to building churches, winning converts and translating the Bible into African langu› ages.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

The spread of civilization would be an incidental by-product which the palm-oil trade, limited to coastal transactions, could not achieve on its own. 47 Thus the Protestant missions, very much of this world, took on the role of reformers, which included interfering in political and military strategy. The Abeokuta missionaries suggested to England the making of a road to the sea, in order to speed up the barter trade - and the delivery of war material.

They were committed to constitutionalism, gradualism, and cultural assimilation as advocated by a few white liberals among the settlers. But they also were disciples of Booker T. Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.746, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GAMBIA, WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Appeal of a Native African Clergyman on behalf of his Fellow-Countrymen.\n\nThe Rev. George Nicol, Colonial Chaplain of the British Settlements of the River Gambia, who is at present on a visit to this country, desires to draw attention to the following statement: His special work is to minister to the officers of the Colonial Government, the European merchants, and the large and increasing body of Christian traders who are constantly coming into the settlement from Sierra Leone and other parts of the Coast. To these he ministers, and superintends an organization similar to that found in any well-worked parish in England. The congregation is occasionally increased by the visit of one of Her Majesty’s ships. He has also the spiritual charge of the convicts in the gaol and the inmates of the Colonial Hospital. In connection with the Colonial Church at Bathurst there is now a congregation of 200 Christian worshippers and about eighty communicants. The church can only accommodate 250. In addition to the work connected with his chaplaincy, Mr. Nicol recognizes the claims of the heathen upon the Christian Church, and has started three missions for those in and around the town of Bathurst; but as yet has been unable to reach the neighbouring tribes—namely, the Jolas, the Sérérés, the Polos, and the Mandingoes. For upwards of 600 miles higher up the River Gambia, on either bank of that noble river, one mercantile firm alone has seventy trading factories. There is not one resident missionary preaching the Gospel to the people trading with these merchants. Merchant clerks and other traders go up and down the country for the purpose of trade, but there is not one Christian teacher, European or native, who has taken up his residence among the people to learn their language and to instruct them. It is this sad state of things Mr. Nicol is anxious to remedy. He has formed at the Gambia a Native Church Missionary Association, and by the aid of his congregation and the merchants on the spot, has raised 50l. and built a small school chapel on the outskirts of Bathurst which is open daily for service and evangelistic meetings, and where a lay-helper is rendering efficient service. He has also been invited to build another chapel at Albreda, eighty miles up the river.\n\nThe present appeal is for funds to build School Chapels and Mission Houses at several of the most important trading stations. To do this satisfactorily, 1,000l. must be raised; and to maintain the necessary mission agents and teachers, at least 500l. per annum is required.\n\nIt may be added that the Church Missionary Society would rejoice to see this work advanced, though unable themselves to undertake the responsibility of any fresh expenditure in this part of the world; and that the Rev. R. C. Billing, who has for so many years been interested in the Native African Church and its missionary activities, has carefully considered these proposals with Mr. Nicol.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1883#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Bishop of the Niger Territory', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Right Rev.

The Bishop, who is a venerable-looking gentleman, now in his eighty-first year, very quiet in manner, and with all the impressive actions which belong to the negro race, has had a life full of adventure which has been almost entirely devoted to the propagation of the Christian religion among his fellow-natives. While yet a child he was kidnapped from his tribe—the Yorubas—and sold at Lagos in 1822. He was, however, rescued by a British ship, taken to Sierra Leone, and educated there by the Church Missionary Society. He was baptised in 1825, and was afterwards employed as a teacher, and in 1843, having been ordained priest, he was sent to his own country, Yoruba, to assist in the conversion of his people. In 1857 he was appointed leader of the New Niger Mission, and on St. Peter\'s day 1864, he was consecrated at Canterbury Cathedral the first Bishop of the Niger. Since that date his whole energy has been devoted to the conversion of the heathen in those regions.\n\nThe other day a representative of the _Pall Mall Gazette_ had a few minutes\' chat with the aged Bishop.

We are progressing in a wonderful manner. The white traders, who are Christians, have quite abandoned work on Sunday, and instead come to worship at our church and chapels. More, they bring the natives down from the country to worship with us. Not Christian natives, you must understand, but heathens. The traders do this. They are not missionaries, but they help us in our missionary work. At one chapel 250 of these heathens come regularly and join in the service.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary. He has mistaken his vocation.

I send with them a clear statement of our purpose, and especially of those circumstances which are making us feel the need of sympathy, help, and encouragement from our brethren in the Mother Church. In venturing to trouble you with a few facts, I am acting as the spokesman of all those principal Church members who assembled at Kissy Road Church, on June 2, to bid our brethren God speed; and I trust the following statement may meet the eye of many friends of Africa.\n\n(1.) This is the scene of the earliest work of the Church Missionary Society. It was led up to by striking providences. It has been costly in human life as well as in money. Not less than half a million, I believe, has been spent here. The outward and visible result is a compact Native Church of some fifteen parishes, not including the cathedral, with a native pastor, parsonage, church and school in each parish.\n\n(2.) This Church, though mainly self-supporting, is still receiving £300 per annum from the C.M.S., which is now being withdrawn at the rate of £50 per annum. We raised last year, for instance, for the Pastorate, _amongst ourselves_, £1,169 18s. 3d class pence alone producing £937 14s. 11d. This is about the average.\n\n(3.) We are a missionary Church. The C.M.S. handed over its missions to the Native Church in 1875. Our Society is called the Sierra Leone Church Missionary Society. We have two missions in the Bullom and in the Quiah country. We have two ordained missionaries with catechists under them. They cost us about £400 per annum. These missions are not making much progress; we scarcely maintain the _status quo_. We can only be said to affirm the principle of the thing. All this thickly populated region, from the far interior to our very border, is practically unevangelized.\n\n(4.) Sierra Leone is only important, financially, as a depot for trade. The Peninsula, though mountainous and fair-looking, is unproductive. A good understanding with the tribes in the interior is all that is wanted to make the Colony prosperous. We have a fine harbour, and are accessible to England, but the place by itself will neither support a Church nor even a Government. And thus I come to the ground of our plea for sympathy and help. Our importance as a Church is that we may be a depot for the interior and around. Heathen and Mahomedans trade with us, settle amongst us, and crowd our streets every day. Nothing is being done for them. Their influence on us is not for good. We are engaged in hand-to-hand intercourse, but not hand-to-hand conflict with their superstitions and sins. The result is enfeebling. We are awakening to feel our need of more spiritual power. We are planning for a general mission next dry season, but we desire to make known other needs only second in importance.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ANOTHER PROPOSED EXPLORATION IN THE RIVER CONGO.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'That ardent, indefatigable, and munificent friend of Africa, Mr. Robert Arthington, of Leeds, lately opened a correspondence with the Baptist Missionary Society, which has for above thirty years had a mission at the Cameroons River, with the object of urging and assisting them to plant a mission on the River Congo. Mr. Arthington quotes many authorities in proof of the hopefulness of such an undertaking, and then adds:—\n\n""It is, therefore, a great satisfaction and a high and sacred pleasure to me to offer one thousand pounds, if the Baptist Missionary Society will undertake at once to visit these benighted, interesting people with the blessed light of the Gospel, teach them to read and write, and give them in imperishable letters the words of eternal truth. By-and-by, possibly, we may be able to extend the mission eastwards on the Congo at a point above the rapids. But, however that may be, I hope that soon we shall have a steamer on the Congo, if it should be found requisite, and carry the Gospel eastwards and south and north of the river, as the way may open as far as Nyangwe."" The London Missionary Society take twenty miles west of Lake Tanganyika.\n\nIt is at Congo, the San Salvador of the Portuguese, that Mr. Arthington wishes the mission station to be located. This place is 1,500 feet above the sea level, and in comparison with the coast districts is cool and healthy. The Committee of the Society, after mature examination and consideration, decided in favour of a preliminary expedition to explore the region and report on the prospects for future work; on referring to Mr. Arthington, he approves of the course. ""In my opinion,"" he says, ""it would be wise to send without delay a man most prayerfully chosen, full of faith and love, who will determinately make his way to the King of Congo, and ask him if he would receive and encourage your Christian missionary, and at the same time he should make all possible inquiries.

And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support? Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""BISHOP CROWTHER'S SUCCESSOR."", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is our conviction that one of the reasons for the character which Christianity now manifests in Africa is the fact that it has been held too long in a state of dependence; and that it has been too long in the habit of looking to its foreign parent for immediate guidance and direction in almost every thing, and this you will admit, does not make much for the development of that manly independence and self-reliance which are so essential for the development of a strong people and a vigorous institution.\n\nWe are not blaming our teachers who have sacrificed themselves on the altar of love for us.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE MISSIONARY WORK OF THE BAPTIST MISSIONARY SOCIETY IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our missions in Africa date farther back than is commonly supposed.

A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools. The difficulties to be overcome in this mission have been very great; not the least being the necessity of providing the people with written languages.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them.

Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries.

At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

The 1900 Agreement distributed land in Buganda in an attempt to create a landed class that would be loyal to the colonial system. This land distribution led to the development of different class and property relations since landlords and tenants came into existence. In addition, it was understood that Uganda was to be a country where African agricultural production predominated. This was one of the factors that acted as a barrier to large-scale white settlement, such as took place in Kenya and Tanganyika. Unlike in Kenya, but as was more the case in Tanganyika, efforts were made by the colonial regime to place the export-oriented economy into the hands of the indigenous people. The peasant production of cash crops was to become the mainstay of the economy of Uganda. What started in Buganda was eventually extended to other parts of the colony, notably in the west where the climate, as in Buganda, was favourable. By 1907, cotton produced in this manner accounted for 35% of all exports from Uganda.$^{39}$ Generally speaking, cash transactions were well entrenched in Uganda, as in the rest of East Africa, on the eve of the First World War.

Notable among them was Kakunguru, a Muganda general, who largely spearheaded the spread of British control to eastern and northern Uganda. It was he, for instance, who captured Kabarega when the British decided to storm his hide-out in Lango country.$^{31}$ The 1900 Agreement made the Baganda partners with the British in the advance of British imperialism in the area.

But soon the coastal traders were able to visit the other capitals. The exception here would be Rwanda and Burundi, where the rulers were able to keep coastal traders out of their region and develop successful tactics for coping with the guns used by their adversaries.$^{31}$ On the other hand, the rulers of Bunyoro were also struggling to attract traders to their capital. In the 1870s the king of Bunyoro, Kabarega, was trying to compete with Buganda in making direct contacts with Zanzibar, while at the same time trying to attract the 'Khartoumers' (traders coming down the Nile) who were raiding widely among the non-centralized societies bordering the kingdom on the northern side.$^{32}$ It was Buganda under Mutesa (1856-84) which seems to have gained most from the coastal trade. A centralized government with a disciplined bureaucracy had been established earlier. But the traffic in guns which Mutesa kept under his personal control further strengthened the centralized system. Buganda seems to have concentrated its attention more on the international trade than the regional network.

At times, Mutesa even sought to control both Karagwe and Buzinza to ensure that coastal caravans could get to his capital without problems.\nClearly, in the Great Lakes region some of the larger kingdoms were greatly strengthened by their connections with the coastal traders.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Certainly, the Sokoto empire, the Massina empire, the empire of al-Hadjd) 'Umar and, above all, that of Samori were typical examples of the centralizing tendencies in nineteenthcentury African politics. The Nguni migrations had the same result, as has been pointed out already. Other typical examples of centralization can be found in Ethiopia, Madagascar and Buganda.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, both Ethiopia and Mada› gascar consisted of a series of independent rival states. However, as will be seen below,$^{54}$ by the end of our period, the former had been united mainly through military conquest under the leadership of one of the central states of Shoa, whose king, Menelik II, assumed the title of Emperor of the united kingdom in 1889. At the same time, and using the same methods, the central Imerina kingdom under the inspired leadership of King Andrianaimpoinimerina (1782-1810) and his successors subdued and absorbed virtually all the states of the northern, eastern and central parts of that island.

The rivalry for control of trade increased the social disruption and this was further intensified by population move› ments caused by the contemporaneous Nguni (also referred to as Ngoni in some of the literature) invasion. The consequent instability increased the number of people who were ready to follow enterprising leaders. In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another. In the 1860s the Arabs managed to have Mnwa Sele deposed and replaced by Mkasiwa, and Mnwa Sele's brother Simba left Unyanyembe to set up his kingdom among the Konongo to the south-west of Tabora. Another member of the chiefly family in Unyan› yembe called Nyungu ya Ma we left his country in 1874 to establish a well-organized kingdom among the Wakimbu to the south-west of the Wanyamwezi. Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Internal initiatives', 'content': 'This groping for renewal and reform is just as discernible in the activities of various rulers who faced the challenges of the Mfecane, of those seeking to re-establish imperial order in Ethiopia, or those of the shaykhs of the Western and Central Sudan looking to the traditions of Islam for ideas of a new social and political order. Largely because of the writings of the djihad leaders and European travellers, we know enough about the complex of forces and ideas that produced the series of revolutionary movements starting from Futa Toro, Futa Jallon and Bondu in the eighteenth century and stretching to the Sokoto, Massina and Dinguiraye djihäds in the nineteenth. We therefore do not need to speculate about the possible contribution to that complex of forces and ideas of European mercantilist influence in the days of the slave trade or capitalist influence in the days of abolition and journeys of discovery. The initiative for the djihäd movements came from within. The djihäd states took a great interest in promoting agriculture, partly through traditional household production, partly also through estates worked by slave or client labour. They also promoted industrial manufacture and trade. They improved trade routes and offered protection to traders and merchants. By far the greatest portion of the traffic on the routes was for local and regional exchange. But the djihad leaders also promoted trans-Saharan trade routes and the pilgrimage route to the Eastern Sudan, the Nile Valley and Mecca. Evidence is building up that these internal trading initiatives had developed trade routes that permitted trans-continental traffic before the new European trade of the nineteenth century.$^{28}$ The Europeans, of course, were quick to note the results of these internal initiatives and were attracted to the possibility of profiting from them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Notable examples of this tendency were the initial impact of the Mfecane, and the impact of trade and the Chokwe and Ovimbundu expansion on the Luba and Lunda state systems.$^{4}$ Several states and empires disappeared.

The search for more stable political structures had been going on throughout the nineteenth century and indeed before then as part of the general evolution of the peoples. Perhaps there was a quickening of the pace, and changes hitherto associated with the rise of states like Old Oyo in the seventeenth century or Asante, Dahomey, Futa Jallon, Futa Toro and Bondu in the eighteenth century became more general in the nineteenth century.

An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks. When he started a branch of the African Orthodox Church in Uganda, the political and social purpose was clear in his declaration that the Church was '... for all right-thinking Africans, men who wish to be free in their own house, not always being thought of as boys'.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

According to the estimate of Colonel Grant, who was his guest twenty-three years ago, M\'tesa was probably not more than forty-eight years of age at the time of his death, and, having succeeded his father, Suna, in 1857, he has reigned twenty-eight years. The Waganda have the names of thirty-five kings who have reigned down to the time of M\'tesa in regular succession, and this, as Colonel Grant points out, may probably account for the ""blue blood"" and vanity which certainly ran in the veins of M\'tesa. Probably, however, no other native African prince has been able to organize a state so completely and make so great an advance towards civilization as the King who has just died. Colonel Grant, who knew him well, speaks of him in terms of real respect, and his estimate is supported by Sir Samuel Baker and Mr. Stanley. As we know, the result of Mr. Stanley\'s visit was that missions were established in the country, which have had gratifying success. But M\'tesa was much perplexed when he learned that there are two Christian religions, the adherents of which are as hostile to each other as both are to Mahomedanism or heathenism. Doubtless from the European point of view M\'tesa was guilty of great cruelties; but these apparently indiscriminate sacrifices of human life were really the recognized and organized modes of administering justice in Uganda. M\'tesa himself was evidently a man governed largely by impulse. When Baker was all but defeated by the Wanyoro, a force from Uganda arriving in the distance was the cause of the dispersion of the enemy. M\'tesa forwarded letters from Baker to Livingstone by his swift-footed soldiers, who, after a journey of 600 miles, found the veteran traveller was dead. These and other facts show that M\'tesa was capable of taking a real interest in matters far outside the range of the ordinary savage mind. His army, wonderfully organized and disciplined, Mr. Stanley estimates at 125,000 men, and his fleet at 500 canoes.

It is gratifying to learn that there have been comparatively little violence and bloodshed at the change of monarchy. It used to be the custom at the coronation for a new king to sacrifice his brothers—a custom which the latter evidently regarded as perfectly natural. M\'tesa\'s brothers, at the time of Colonel Grant\'s visit, went about in chains, but all the same, and though conscious of their fate, ""conversed and attended picnics, and boated, and played musical instruments with their brother, the King, with perfect freedom of action and of speech."" What the outside influences have been that have had a civilizing effect on Uganda before it was discovered by Europeans, we do not know; what they have been since, we do know pretty fully, and the results so far have been, on the whole, good.

Many of our readers are aware that an obstacle to the opening up of Uganda has existed in the regular route from Zanzibar, for a vast extent of very unhealthy territory has to be traversed. Mr. Joseph Thomson\'s explorations revealed an alternative road, much shorter, and altogether more suitable for Europeans. In addition to its natural advantages, the new course possesses some of a political character, for German acquisitions threaten to block the line from Zanzibar to the Equatorial lakes. Bishop Hannington appreciated the importance of keeping the quick route open for missionary communication with the interior, and he resolved to be its pioneer. Within two days\' journey of Rubaga, where the King of Uganda resides, Mr. Thomson had turned aside, seeing the full danger of proceeding further in that direction. This risk is owing to the dislike on the part of the King to intercourse by what correspondents call the ""back door."" Mwanga appreciates neither the utility nor the power of the Christian missionaries. He is in league with the Arab slave dealers, who hate missions in every shape, and he looked on the adoption of the direct route as an audacious invasion.

In this region the Arab race, inactive elsewhere, retains something of its ancient vigour. For many generations it pervaded the recesses of the African continent, inaccessible to all other foreigners, for purposes of trade. European inroads upon its preserves in the present age have roused it and embittered it. Christian missionary efforts have provoked its theological emulation, which in Africa formerly was an aspect it was not especially solicitous to display. The result is a fury in the resistance to Christian civilization seldom exhibited of old. Arab opponents of the missionaries have an argument always ready which is sure of reception in the native mind. They denounce the strangers as ""land-eaters,"" and the negro is prepared to believe the charge. Undoubtedly Europeans, particularly Englishmen, have been and still are ""land-eaters,"" but they can with a good conscience repudiate any inclination of the sort towards Central Africa. The difficulty is to convince a negro, who regards his country with loving admiration, that the C.M.S. is inspired by no lower motive than compassion. Suliman\'s insinuations of the covetous intentions of Mr. Mackay\'s compatriots find an echo in the breast of Mwanga, which only the experience of time can still. The possibility of the choice of the route by Uganda for the Emin expedition is known to have alarmed the King. He feels that, if an occasion be wanted for proceedings against him, his butchery of Bishop Hannington has furnished it. The situation, with all its risks and perplexities, is pictured in Bishop Parker\'s letter. Evidently it demands the employment of the highest gifts of patience, sympathy, and diplomacy. Many persons in the security of their own country may be disposed to be indignant at the use of forbearance towards a guilty wretch like Mwanga. They would be glad to chastise him and his councillors. If the effort be too costly, the alternative, in their view, is to leave the people to its savagery. Force, if it were otherwise practicable, would be utterly wasted. The sole chance for negro vitality is the cultivation of a sense of national self-respect among the natives and the offer of Western civilization as a support, not as a solvent, of territorial independence. The existence of the Mission, lying altogether in Mwanga\'s power, yet staying against his declared will, is more conclusive evidence of the strength of Christianity in Africa than would be its predominance by the tyrant\'s dethronement. There would have been no shame had the Mission voluntarily broken itself up in the face of the young King\'s insolent enmity. Its persistency is magnanimous; it is the one way of testing the ability of Christian truth and humanity to hold its ground without the accessories of gunboats and rifles both against heathendom and Islam.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Voyage of the Raleigh', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There has lately been published an account, from the pen of one of its victims, of the late revolution in Uganda. The Rev.

After a period of imprisonment, he and his companions were placed in a boat upon the Victoria Nyanza, and bidden to depart, as it had been determined that no white teachers should live in Uganda. The value of Mr. Gordon\'s account consists principally in the picture it gives of life and politics in Uganda, and the light it throws on the designs of the Arabs in Central and Eastern Africa. Mwanga, the son of Mtesa, had his father\'s cruelty without the latter\'s strength and statecraft. During his life Mtesa had encouraged strangers, both Christians and Mohammedans. Hence arose two sects of reformers, Christian and Mohammedan. Mwanga trusted neither, but employed both. His misgovernment exasperated all; while he was plotting to destroy both parties.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years.

There he fell in with about fifty men of Jackson’s expedition, who had been left in charge of the camp while Jackson and the remainder of his force had gone north to shoot elephants. Jackson had arrived at Kavirondo in October 1889, but hesitated about advancing into Uganda, thinking his party not strong enough to assist the Christian party against the Arab faction then in possession of Uganda, King Mwanga having offered to accept the British protectorate if assisted by Jackson.\n\nPeters stayed four days at Kavirondo, and while there assisted the Sultan to fight a hostile tribe called Mangati, living on the north-east coast of the Victoria Nyanza. These he beat, and then hoisted the German flag there. After this he turned to the north-west, towards Emin Pasha’s most eastern station, which he hoped to reach. Up to this time Peters had received no news of any sort.\n\nEarly in February he reached Kwateleessa, and thence proceeded as far as the Wachores country, or Akola, about six days’ journey from Emin’s first station. Here he received news from the Uganda natives that Emin had gone away with Stanley. He asked these people about the position of the Christian party in Uganda, and learned that they were taking refuge in the islands in Lake Victoria Nyanza, as they had possession of all the boats, and when unable to resist the Arab faction retreated to the islands, where the Arabs could not follow them.\n\nPeters then marched slowly west towards the Nile, hoping news would overtake him. At this time a letter from Stanley addressed to the English expedition, which Stanley expected would be then at Ussoga, fell into Peters’s hands, and as they had not arrived Peters opened it, and thus got the news he wanted. He then marched south-west to Uganda, and on the way received invitations from the Christians to come and assist them. At Ussoga, Peters, on February 16, slept in the place in which Bishop Hannington was murdered. On February 17 he crossed the Nile at Ripon Falls, and marched into Uganda, the country being all waste through the frequent fighting of the rival parties.

Hence the commercial value of the districts concerned had not as yet been fairly tested or received adequate attention. The source from which he had hoped to raise a revenue in Uganda was mainly by dues on ivory and by certain taxes. Traders from the coast would pay a trading tax on their exports to assist the cost of administration, and there would, of course, be no monopoly of trade. The only dues levied would be such as were due in recognition of the advantages enjoyed. A poll tax on natives he looked upon as a dangerous experiment. The products of interior Africa were of two classes—those whose value rendered them profitable under present modes of transport, and those which would be available with cheaper transport. Of the first class the most important was ivory. It was his idea at one time that the supply of ivory must rapidly fail; but he had come away from East Africa with the knowledge that there were yet vast quantities of ivory available, but elephants were being destroyed wholesale by the Manyema hunters and the Arabs of the Congo Free State. Unless concerted action were taken for their preservation it would be a Quixotic humanity to stand by to see the Manyema fill their pockets at our expense. But measures should be taken for the preservation of elephants in districts of the British sphere. Next in order of value for export purposes was coffee. There was plenty of room in Uganda for the cultivation of coffee and even of cereals. In the Southern Soudan large quantities of cotton were grown, and its culture was being introduced in the areas adjoining the Albert Lake.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1893#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH EAST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Meantime it is said that the Company contemplates the abandonment of Uganda, and leaving it to the French Catholic missionaries.

Still, his appointment implies responsibility on the part of the Government for the promotion of British interests in this part of Africa; and this is not consistent with a passive attitude.\n\nThe news that Dr. Peters contemplates the subjugation of the Masai around Kilimanjaro is serious. The result will be to drive these Masai north into British territory, and probably to rouse their fellow-tribesmen there. The Company will be able to cope with any general Masai rising, but the drain on its resources would be trying.\n\nThe disaster to the German expedition is at a spot too remote directly to affect British interests. This disaster is a serious one for the Germans, and will no doubt be followed by a strong expedition to enforce vengeance.

It seems to have more in its favour than any other. Much of the country is barren, but there are many valleys covered capable of agricultural development. Captain Lugard makes many recommendations as to what might be done which no doubt will have serious attention. Elephants, camels, and mules may all be used as beasts of burden. Captain Lugard received orders to proceed at once to Uganda—the state of affairs was most critical—and lost no time in carrying out his orders. He did his best to get together a force, but all included, he had only 300 men and a Maxim gun, but its ammunition was scanty. He felt he must make as speedy a march as possible, and take the Waganda by surprise; and so proceeded through Kamasia and Upper Kavirondo to Usogo, the country which borders on Uganda.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF UGANDA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Speaking of the British East Africa Company\'s method of Government in his report, Sir Gerald Portal says: The history of British East Africa for the last five years and its present condition show us clearly that the experiment here of combining administration and trade in the same hands has proved a failure, and that the sooner this system is discontinued the better it will be for the Native races, for British commerce, for Zanzibar, and, I believe, for the Company itself. He holds that the work of the British East Africa Company might now be looked upon as ended; and there would be little difficulty in obtaining the withdrawal, or resignation of the Charter granted them by her Majesty, and suggests that the Company in surrendering concessions received from Zanzibar would be entitled to compensation from the Sultan. Sir Gerald recommends that an English Commissioner be appointed for Uganda and the neighbouring countries as far as the eastern border of Kavirondo, with a staff of 13 English officers and a force of 500 Soudanese soldiers. The duty of the British Commissioner would be to ensure the safety of Europeans living in Uganda, to repel foreign enemies, to prevent and suppress civil war and rebellion, to collect Customs duties, encourage commerce, and repress slavery and the slave trade. He recommends a road commandant to be appointed, to have control of the transport service from Kikuyu to the Lake, to effect all possible improvements in the means of communication, to exercise supervision over Arab, Swahili, and European caravans. He should with this object be given certain magisterial powers. His force should consist of one European assistant and 167 porters at an estimated cost of £4,750 per annum. A station or depot should be established at the head of ""Berkeley Bay,"" chosen last year by the railway survey as the site for a suitable harbour at the north-east corner of Lake Victoria. This should be the farthest open for caravans. Communication thence to Uganda should be by water. Two small steam launches or cutters should be sent up of a speed of not less than five miles per hour and adapted for burning wood. Each should be under the charge of an English engineer. By carrying or towing the goods of traders these boats should earn the expenses of their maintenance. A Commissioner should be appointed to reside at Kikuyu with a staff of four Europeans, sixty Zanzibar soldiers, and 239 porters, &c. The establishment of this station, with stores of food and a colony of cultivators around it, would go far to diminish both the expense and the difficulties of the journey to the Lake. The total cost of this establishment would be £6,600 per annum. The road from the coast to Kikuyu might, if no better solution could be adopted, be left in the hands of the Zanzibar Government. So long as the present system of transport is maintained along what is called the English route it would be necessary to make greater provision for the safety and independence of the local authorities. Under existing conditions not only would any real progress be laborious and uncertain, but the retention of authority in Uganda and any improvement in the condition of that country would react mainly to the benefit not of ourselves, but of the German colony. Transport from the German coast to the south shore lake is cheaper, the road is more frequented, porters are more easily obtained, and food is more abundant than in the English sphere. Arab and European traders from the south, by their ivory and slaves in Uganda, avoid payment of any kind of duty to British authority by taking their caravans to the German coast ports. In Uganda there exists a demand for European commodities such as cotton cloths, boots, and clothing. If the present system of transport is continued these articles will be supplied from German sources and by the German route. To stop this system the transport by the English route must be made the safest, cheapest, and quickest. It would then drain the commerce of all the countries lying around Lake Victoria. The only means of effectively doing this is by making a railway.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1894#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DEATH OF KING MTESA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The death of King Mtesa, of Uganda, removes an African potentate of whom the record of travellers in the Dark Continent gives rather a picturesque glimpse than a complete and satisfying description. The most striking account of this personage is certainly that given by M. Licant, a lieutenant of Gordon Pasha, by whom he was sent to that prince\'s capital on the shores of Lake Victoria. The following is a summary of what he wrote: Mtesa\'s chair used to be placed on a leopard\'s skin in the hall of audience, so that the hind claws served as a kind of footstool, while the tail stretched along the floor in front of him. A number of charms and a large tusk were piled up in a heap beside him, and his Grand Vizier and other courtiers were constantly employed in ""smoothing down the creases in his trousers""—a unique and, perhaps, the strangest mode of expressing complete servility ever devised by a barbarous despot. Another traveller, Colonel Long, of the Khedivial army, brought back such a favourable description of Mtesa, although he only saw him once, that Ismail wished to send him a magnificent carriage, which General Gordon, with his usual good sense, intercepted en route. The late Khedive also sent two sheikhs to convert Mtesa to Mahomedanism, but they do not seem to have had much success, as he was strongly opposed to the doctrines, or more probably to the policy of Islam. He described himself in a letter to Gordon Pasha as ""the son of Suna, King of Uganda,"" and he also said that he ""wanted to be good friends with the English."" After this letter, introducing himself as it were, he showed every desire to keep on amicable terms with Egypt, and those travellers and missionaries who reached his State were generally well treated by him. His later correspondence consisted principally of requests for the articles of Europe which had either caught his fancy or seemed most suitable to his wants. A looking-glass, gold and silver lace, a stamp with his name on it, and some gold and silver coins, such as sovereigns, napoleons, and dollars, he asked for repeatedly, and generally managed to obtain. He even sent some of the watches he had received as presents to Europe to be mended, and showed in many other little ways his desire to learn more of the great world he had heard of in regions milder than his torrid kingdom round Lakes Albert and Victoria, and to establish some friendly relations with the Europeans who had reached his territory in their search for the sources of the Nile. One incident in connexion with his government has been preserved, and as it throws some light on the mode of waging war in that part of Africa, it may be quoted. An island called Sassé was the particular object of his ambition; but its inhabitants preferred their liberty, and, being expert divers, whenever Mtesa\'s war canoes approached, they dived underneath them, and, cutting the withes, sank boats and crews together. As Mtesa was ""corpulent and consumptive"" ten years ago, his death is not surprising, and the cessation of Egyptian activity in the equatorial region will leave his people free to arrange the question of succession without any foreign interference.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1883#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Exploration in Central Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""My Lord,—Since I last wrote from here I have made a successful voyage round the southern part of the Tanganyika, and have discovered its outlet in a river named the Lukuga, a little to the south of the group of islands visited by Captain Speke in 1859.

The Guinea palm extends, I believe, from the West Coast to here; india-rubber is abundant in Manyema; sem sem (from which much so-called olive oil is extracted) grows well wherever cultivated; the castor-oil plant grows almost wild; ground nuts the same; copper and gold are found in Katanga; cotton grows well, and of two or three kinds; coffee is reported to grow wild; ivory, it is well known, mostly comes from this portion of Africa; there are many sorts of fibrous substances which might be exported with advantage, and the various millets and maize grow in such abundance that they would form a profitable export; rice also grows most luxuriantly wherever cultivated. The only obstacles to a free water communication of which I know are the Yellala Falls and the rapids on the Lualaba, a short way above the Nyangwé; the Lukuga is at present obstructed with grass, but a way might easily be cut through that. The trade at present is, about here, entirely in the hands of Arabs, who, when in Manyema, live nearly entirely by plunder, and who take the wretched inhabitants as slaves to carry their ivory and other goods. The efforts of England will, I trust, be successful in putting down the slave trade by sea, but at present they leave untouched an equally crying evil, the internal trade, which is rapidly depopulating vast districts. In going round the lake I was constantly shown places where villages had been, and when I asked where the former inhabitants were, invariably received the same answer, \'Killed or carried off for slaves.\' The price of a slave is only 5 dolis (20 yards) of calico, while the hire of a passage is 5l from Unyanyembe here; so that it is far cheaper to buy slaves than to hire porters; besides which, no porters are obtainable in Manyema, and the whole trade there is carried on by means of slaves. The Arabs take with them a horde of Wangwana, or freed men, armed with muskets, and carry a few stores by means of domestic slaves; and the ivory, of which they obtain large quantities, is all brought by fresh-caught slaves to Ujiji. The numbers of Arabs settling in the country is constantly increasing, and they all have large numbers of slaves for domestic purposes, for cultivating their gardens, and for porters. Many of those employed as porters only receive rations whilst on journeys, and when not travelling have to live by plunder. Of the relations between the various tribes there is little to be said; the agricultural people seldom make war on each other, unless they get mixed up with the quarrels of the Arabs, to any great extent; the predatory tribes prey on all others indiscriminately, carrying off slaves, and murdering all who attempt to resist. The cattle they slaughter at once, and find a ready market for their slaves among the Arab traders and tribes with whom they are not actually warring. I am afraid that stopping the export of slaves, although it will diminish the evil in the districts round the Nyass, from whence Kilwa draws its principal supplies, will only exacerbate it elsewhere by causing many now engaged in that trade to settle in the interior, where they will become slave-holders and traders afresh. In conclusion, let me add that, in my belief, this internal slave trade will continue to increase until proper means of communication are opened up, and the country brought under the influence of civilization and legitimate commerce.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-05-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1874#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The available evidence leads to the conclusion that the progress of Islam in Central Africa is more rapid than it is in India.

As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . .

A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.762, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Christianity served a similar purpose, providing a cultural framework for creating a Creole society out of disparate groups of peoples settled in Freetown and surrounding villages, as in various settlements on the Liberian coast, or in Libreville, Freretown, and other freed slave settlements. In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The spread of Christianity, Islam and western education was another important impact of colonialism. There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways.

They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

For by then, the missionaries had begun their own northward drive from the first footholds on the coast, usually only a few steps ahead of arms-backed commercial companies. ' 2 They completed the task which Islam had begun by forbidding their adherents membership of any cult. These theatre companies were run like family guilds, with the familiar practice of trade secrets and initiatory rites; their material was also firmly rooted in the traditional - all of which qualified them for definition as devilish, sinister cults. The Christian missionaries, like the Muslims, did not content themselves with banning only the performances. Like the mbira in Southern Africa, instruments which were associated with such theatre arts were banished with equal vigour. A vacuum was thus created into which the returnee slaves' culture neatly stepped.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained. Today, African art, music and dance are not only taught in educational institutions of all kinds but are now in boom in Africa and gaining recognition in Europe. Thus, as far as the cultural field is concerned, colonialism was certainly a mere episode and its impact skin-deep and very ephemeral."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.744, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': 'one which had great consequences for subsequent African nationalist movements in the mid-twentieth century.

Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The caravan followed Mr. Thomson's route and encampments as closely as possible throughout the way to Kavirondo, which was reached on October 8. The Bishop proposed that he should go to Uganda with fifty men, while the rest should remain at Sundu's village. At Uganda the Bishop said he should arrange with some of the missionaries there, and if any expressed a desire to go to the coast, he would ask them to take the new route and pick up the caravan at Sundu's village, and then proceed to the coast. Accordingly he got all the loads selected, and packed sufficient to take the party to Uganda, and thence to the coast *viâ* Unyamwezi. On the 12th October, he, with the party of fifty men and their loads, left the remainder of the caravan at Sundu's village, under the writer's charge.""}, {'id': 5467, 'article_title': 'THE NEWEST BRITISH COLONY.', 'full_section_title': 'THE NEWEST BRITISH COLONY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1887#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_01_1887', 'content': ""## BYWATER, TANQUERAY, & Co., 79, Queen Victoria Street, London (late BYWATER, PERRY, & Co.), are Agents for Residents abroad, Missionaries, Chaplains, &c., in every part of the world.

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary. He has mistaken his vocation. He may be a very good man, he may have high and exalted motives, he may ardently desire the conversion of the heathen; but if human infirmities of mind and temper', 'last_edit_date': '1878-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1878#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—In your March number you inserted an article, ""A Ga Sabbato School"" in our town, founded by some young gentlemen.

May their work prosper!\n\nBut it was not commendable to see how other people tried to make use of this work. Scarcely did the Rev. Shamfelt read that article than he came to seek the school. Luckily none of the ten or twelve persons whom he asked could give any information about it, and he was thus obliged to go back without having effected his object. And that was well.

We are told that it is now more than fifty years since the missionaries have been on this coast, and that the missionaries are greatly complaining of seeing no success in their work. But we found it otherwise. There is very much done in these fifty years, especially in the second to the fourth decenary. The missionaries know themselves how many congregations they have, and how many members of whom they cannot say that all are chaff. Besides there are lots of healthy houses built, the whole Bible, and other useful books are translated into these languages, so that our present missionaries need no more ""to pick up the languages word by word from the thick lips of the negro with great difficulty!"" A whole staff of native assistants is formed, whose help our missionaries should better acknowledge. We are sure there would be more success if they continue their works in the same manner, instead of sitting and lamenting the incorrigibleness of the negroes, and criticising the works of the zealous predecessors of theirs in a most invidious way.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-04-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In that letter Mr. Rosenbush, who has been eighteen years resident at Sierra Leone, states, as an incontrovertible fact, that missionary efforts have produced very beneficial results—that the most cursory comparison of the people of Sierra Leone, composed in a great measure of Africans liberated from the holds of slave-ships, with the natives of places where the influence of missionaries is not known, will establish this without dispute. We refer our readers again to his letter on this very important point, because we feel that as the past has depended, so the future must in no small degree depend, on this of late most calumniated body of men. Whatever may be the other measures adopted for the advancement of Africa, any relaxation of the efforts of missionaries would be a result deeply to be deplored by every one who is looking and labouring for the day of African regeneration. Mr. Rosenbush\'s views so intimately coincide with our own as to the means by which ""improvement and civilization"" may be best advanced in the colony of Sierra Leone, that we may be excused again entering largely upon them at this time. The agricultural improvement of the colony demands the special attention of Government authorities; and when, as in this case, a means is pointed out which only requires a better disposal of the revenues raised in the colony itself, by making them instrumental in obtaining reproductive results from the enforced labour of the criminal portion of the population, instead of that labour being wasted, as at present, no trivial objections or inapplicable theories ought to be allowed to stand in the way of its adoption. There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil. As Christian civilization had to be introduced from Europe, so must the impulse to agricultural industry be introduced from Europe also.

To distant people, we form one of the most intelligent and civilized portions of Africa, who, although not under a European Government, are enjoying as much of their influence as if we were born civilized. But to have a proper knowledge of the cotton tree, it is necessary to approach it more closely, when it will be discovered that it is full of thorns. This is the only way I can contrast what our country is with what it is considered to be. Our country is, undoubtedly, a great port for the palm-oil trade; and it appears to me that the only influence existing is that of raking and draining it of every speck of oil that could be got—and nothing more. Sordid avarice and insatiable gain is their only and chief aim. We own that we are poor, ignorant, heathen people, and, perhaps, vile savages too, as we are often styled; but we cannot feel more happy than when we have Europeans among us, whose goodness we feel proud to copy and imitate. I do not think that the days of contraband, when man formed the chief article of trade among us, were worse than ours—the period when lawful commerce takes the lead, and the Christian religion regulates its progress. Trade, from the way it is carried on, has a rather debasing effect on us; religion, from the stingy manner it is introduced and its principles engrafted, tends to steep us in a twofold ignorance, almost as dark as that in which it found us; so that the only improvement resulting from the advantage both of commerce and religion among us, at present, is a low cunning and a doggish reverence. People whose ears are accustomed to hear the fair carol of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in our country through European influence and missionary efforts, might be constrained to denounce my observations as a slander: but if they know the truly meaning of multum in parvo, and how it is unscrupulously practised by their agents abroad, I need not labour to convince them. I do not ignore the fact that faithful workers have from time to time been sent to our country, and that, through them, we should have been better; but the thing is this, those already in the field informed them, ""When you go to Rome, do what Rome does."" The merchant, whose only ambition is to hoard up all he could rake from the negro\'s hide, grins with pleasure and satisfaction at his wretchedness, contrives new methods of aggravating humanity, and uses all his subtle skill in advocating, if possible, the total extinction of the vague, glimmering twilight that shines around us; and the missionary, as a rule, teaches the black man hardly anything beyond the Bible, transcribed in his own tongue. In one of their conferences, held at Gaboon, the missionaries have decided not to give us and our children any intellectual training. We keenly feel the result of such selfishness, not only for ourselves, but for our children and children\'s children. How painful it is to think that there is not a single youth in our country who is capable of being more than a menial servant in any of the European establishments here! Why is it so different at Bonny, at New Calabar, at Brass, and throughout the Niger territory? It is thirty-six years ago now since a mission was planted in our midst; yet we do not present a brighter aspect than that of a dilapidated and neglected plantation. There is nothing of civilizing industry introduced into the country whereby to profit our youths; whereas in the Niger Mission—which is working exclusively by native agency, headed by its Bishop, and a grand train of clerical and lay assistants—industrial training is incorporated with the work. To every mission-station in the Niger is appended a first-class boarding-school, the pupils of which are fit to teach the teachers whom the Mission here laboured so arduously to produce. The Niger is able to furnish herself with a good staff of able and competent artisans, interpreters, clerks, and teachers; and is getting up a theological institution to train their own men. But here no such things are studied, although I am sure of their meeting the ready approval of our benefactors in Britain.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1884#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRADE IN BRITISH WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber.

In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

Old Calabar is one of these so-called ""Oil River"" Districts; and at Duke Town, which we suppose we must term its capital, one Oroks was lately crowned ""King"" by Consul Hewett. Some of our correspondents strongly condemned this measure, Oroks\' character not being such as to inspire any confidence that the laws and usages of civilization were likely to be honoured and followed by him. We considered the evidence to be very strong against him, but missionary matters being mixed up with the general public ones in our correspondents\' letters, we did not care to insert these in our columns. And now we have the most horrible account of an execution for murder in Duke Town. The particulars will be found in another column; we cannot recapitulate here. But as such atrocities could not possibly be practised under missionary approval, we cannot refrain from noticing the low condition of missionary influence in a small town which has now been some thirty-five years under missionary occupation and teaching. This evidence of the low state of missionary influence justifies all that we have ever written in favour of bringing Old Calabar and the other Oil Rivers under British rule. These trading stations are very expensive for Great Britain. The West African Squadron is principally occupied in keeping them open to trade, and in settling disputes in them between the natives and the European agents of European mercantile houses, while the revenues of Great Britain are not in any way benefited by the trade carried on there. Still, we would not complain of this if we could see that there was progress in civilization. We consider it a duty with which God has charged our country to promote the spread of Christian civilization wherever its influence extends, and can be made to prevail. We are not annexationists by territorial greed. Under our colonial system, the subjects of every country in the world can import and export on the same terms as British merchants, in all our colonies and possessions; and the West African colonies and settlements not affording any facilities for British colonization by natives of Great Britain and Ireland, the only pecuniary advantage Great Britain can derive by holding them can be that she thus prevents the shutting out of her own subjects from trade in them by hostile tariffs and exceptional charges and duties, so often employed against them in the colonial ports of other civilized Powers. To elucidate this, we have only to refer to the difference between French Senegal, from which British commerce is excluded, and the British Gambia, where French mercantile houses are now crowding out the British ones through the operation of differential duties in France, where the ground nuts of the Gambia are converted into Italian olive oil! No; there is no ""Jingoism"" or ""earth greed"" in our advocacy of the subjection of the Oil River districts to British rule, instead of, as now, to spasmodic British intervention. If occupied by Great Britain, or rather, if government in them was administered by Great Britain, Customs\' duties might be made to pay the cost, instead of its falling, as now, upon the Imperial Exchequer; the worst atrocities of heathenism would be put an end to, as Suttee was suppressed in India, and as human sacrifices have been prevented in the Gold Coast districts; and civilization on the basis of Christianity would be gradually propagated, as it has been in other British settlements on the West Coast. Before closing these hasty remarks on a subject of great importance, we cannot refrain from noticing that the person said to have been murdered by the slave who was afterwards so cruelly put to death, is characterized as a ""Christian,"" and that the terms employed respecting him are such as are generally used about Sierra Leone young men. Was this, then, another instance of slave-holding practices by Sierra Leone men—therefore British subjects—professing Christianity? We fear it was, because we have but too much reason to know that not a few Sierra Leone men, educated in Mission schools, do not hesitate, when in heathen trading towns, to buy and hold slaves. May we suggest to the British Consul having jurisdiction in the Oil Rivers to examine into this matter of slave-holding by Sierra Leone educated Africans—British subjects—who are ever ready to claim British protection even when by slave-holding they are violating British laws. We have the firm belief that Africa can only be civilized and Christianized by Christian Africans; and this gives additional importance to a matter on which we think deeply.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1883#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere.

This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter.

Nevertheless, its influence was at work, and it did its utmost to keep princes from succumbing to the Christian religion and its missionaries, as was also the case in Buganda at almost the same period."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Islamic revolutions', 'content': ""But even more far-reaching were the social consequences of these rev› olutions. In the first place, as a result of the educational and proselytizing activities of these djihäd leaders and their supporters and military leaders, most of whom were good Muslim scholars, Islam was not only purified but also transformed from a religion of the towns into that of the rural areas also. Moreover, while the first two leaders belonged to the Kâdirïyya order, al-Hadjdj 'Umar belonged to the relatively new Tijäniyya, which appealed more to the ordinary people. Al-Hadjdj'Umar therefore succeeded in winning a huge following and it is significant that there are more Tijäniyya followers in West Africa today than those of the Kâdirïyya order. Thirdly, with the emphasis of all the three djihäd leaders on education and learning, the level of Islamic scholarship and literacy was greatly raised during the nineteenth century. Finally, as a result of these djihäds, a common feeling of Islamic solidarity grew right across the Sudanic belt which has remained to this day.\nIt should be added in conclusion that the djihäd leaders and their flagbearers did not entirely succeed in establishing the true caliphate ruled in accordance with the sjmrVa in the Western Sudan. Rather, they had to compromise with some of the existing socio-political institutions and realit› ies. What therefore emerged in the end was not uniform and unadulterated Islamic culture and society but rather a Fulbe-Hausa culture in Hausaland and a Fulbe-Mande culture in the area of the Niger bend, though both were heavily impregnated with the tenets of Islam and the teachings of the founding fathers.\nIslam also gained ground in other parts of Africa, especially in Cyrenaica and the eastern Sahara in present-day Libya and, later, in the northern parts of modern Sudan thanks to the activities of the SanüsT and Mahdï respectively, and finally in the interior parts of eastern Africa and especially in Ouganda following the activities of Arab and Swahili traders. 7"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1800-45', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic effects of expanding trade', 'content': ""These changes along the coast were parallelled by those taking place in the hinterland, where many groups experienced 'enlargement of scale' in differing degrees arising from their contact with, and participation in, the long-distance trade.

The Yao chief, Mataka, mentioned above, boasted of his attempts to transform his area into a replica of a coastal settlement.

Islam began to win converts not only among chiefly families, but also for the first time it began to penetrate into the rural areas. Nearest the coast, the Digo and Segeju were the most receptive to the faith. Among the other Miji Kenda, it was not to have any noticeable impact until the last quarter of the century.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

By contrast the Christians tended to create their own separate communities and followed an essentially European way of life.

Becoming Muslim did not therefore require the radical break with tradition which Christian missionaries insisted upon. 'It [Islam] placed more emphasis than Christianity on cohesion and less on competition and individual achievement.'$^{28}$ A further asset in favour of Islam was that with all the disruptions which colonial rule had brought in its wake, there was the need for a new basis for social integration, and Islam provided this basis since it possesses significant resources for those who had lost their traditional roots."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Islam and colonial rule', 'content': 'try to cope with Islam and established institutes to study and document Muslim life, beliefs, practices and institutions. 22 Colonial powers were determined to break up large Muslim states and religious organizations and to foster rivalry and competition among them.

Such a desire led to the resurgence of Mahdism which was to end the rule of the unbeliever. The Mahdï, the equivalent of the Christian Messiah, was believed to be the one who would come into the world to establish a just government in accordance with Islamic dogma and finally rid society of the rule of unbelievers.

The steady increase in the number of Muslims in Sierra Leone from 1891 to 1931 is illustrative of this fact.

For they came to prefer to deal with Islamized Africans rather than with their Christianized counterparts. A French official is reported to have said in 1912 that 'Islamized Negroes are on the whole gentle people who are grateful for the security which our arms have brought them; they only think of living in peace in the shade of our power.' 23 The modernizing influence of Islam was also appreciated by colonial powers who were said to have regarded it as a 'bridge between the narrow particularism of traditional society and the wider impulses and require› ments of modern life and economic interests'.$^{24}$ Submissive Muslim leaders were therefore greatly encouraged and frequently received official favours such as national honours and awards.

The administration in the Belgian Congo was especially hostile to Islam and saw in it a threat to its 'Christianizing' and 'civilizing' mission.

To effectively oppose the spread of Islam and Islamic jurisprudence, they also tried to build up traditional religion and codify African customary law as a counterforce. 21 But the French were more familiar with Islam than traditional African religion in spite of their fear and hostility to the former and when they did not succeed in their intentions they settled down to try to cope with Islam and established institutes to study and document Muslim life, beliefs, practices and institutions. 22 Colonial powers were determined to break up large Muslim states and religious organizations and to foster rivalry and competition among them.

Its followers, and strangers, have ample materials in its history of thirteen centuries for measuring its merits and capabilities. Mahomedans will find scope for triumph as well as for shame. Their faith enjoyed a thousand years of great exploits and magnificent successes. It was a religion of the sword; and by the sword, for a thousand years, it prevailed. But Mahomedans themselves comprehend that only by armed violence can they propagate their doctrines. They perceive that for three centuries their ascendancy in arms has been fading away from them. For observers who, though not Mahomedans, are anxious to do Mahomedanism justice, the question will be what Mahomedanism has done for mankind at large, for others than Mahomedans, and for Mahomedans too. Like all powers which have been allowed to operate, Mahomedanism has had its uses. When Mahomet commenced his mission, Asia and Africa were in the depths of spiritual degradation. Arabia was a land of idolaters. The Eastern Empire was an incubus on the fairest portions of Asia and Europe, which, with its nerveless luxury and indolence, smothered all manliness and every instinct towards virtue. By some means or other, it was peremptorily necessary to sweep away the Byzantine throne and all that belonged to it. The Arabs, on whom the work first devolved, replaced the institutions they demolished by substitutes which stood the comparison. Arab civilization at Cairo, Bagdad, Damascus, Cordova and Seville was of a refinement which the Christian sovereignties it supplanted had not reached. Had Mahomedanism perished under an exertion of brute European strength against its Arab manifestation, it could not be now demonstrated to have been devoid at least of inherent vitality. The transfer of the Mahomedan representation to the Turk has revealed what Mahomedanism was and was obliged to be, whatsoever the hands which guided it. For the Turk as for the Arab, for the Arab as for the Turk, it was a religion which taught how to conquer rather than how to live. Its weapons might not be mere weapons of war. Mahomedan propagandists have won converts by persuasion and example. Pride in belonging to a dominant faith, and the emancipation it promises from castes and class distinctions, have united with the sword in extending the boundaries of Islam. Whether the new believers, however, had been recruited originally by hope or by fear, their belief has always seemed to expend its vigour in the first effort of bringing them within its fold. Mahomedanism as a religion supplied the impetus which acquired empires for the Arab as for the Turk. It did not bestow on the Arab the genius for arts and letters, which the dominion due to his religious enthusiasm enabled him to indulge. It did not incline the Turk to employ opportunities similarly obtained, and, more considerable still, for the education of his ruder nature to intellectual tastes. Christianity has insisted on mingling with every turn and aspiration of the human mind. Mahomedanism, while it claims to direct life, and is not without some doctrines and precepts worthy to direct it, has been satisfied to train the proselytes it has been constantly eager to enroll to despise others rather than to elevate themselves. As an art of life, and especially of social and national life, Mahomedanism has conspicuously failed. From the Koran an abundance of exalted maxims may be quoted which enjoin the practice of virtue, and even of benevolence. In every Mussulman community instances are to be discovered of persons endowed with exemplary Christian graces. No Mussulman State can be shown to have been established on a foundation which was not certain to develop the seeds of corruption and destruction.'}, {'id': 5433, 'article_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'full_section_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1886#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_10_1886', 'content': '""The Niger and Central Soudan Sketches"" was the subject of a paper by Mr. Joseph Thomson, F.R.G.S. In this paper the author described his impressions of the lower part of the Niger and of the Central Soudan acquired in the course of a commercial and political mission last year to the Sultans of Sokoto and Gandu. On his way along the West Coast of Africa he noted the influence for good or evil which contact with white men has had upon the natives, and concluded that while there is much we have reason to be proud of, there is still more of which we ought to feel ashamed. He expressed the opinion that for every negro the missionaries have influenced for good by Christian teaching, a thousand had been driven into deeper degradation by other influences. He also found the settlements absurdly over-governed on a system totally unsuited to the peculiarities of barbarous races. That part of the Niger which the author traversed is divided into three sections according to their physiographical features—(1) the delta, (2) the low-lying region between the delta and the coast mountains, and (3) the irregular valley which has been cut out of the interior plateau. On reaching Lokoja, at the confluence of the Benué with the Niger and the commencement of the third section, the Central Soudan is entered. The changes which occur here, whether physiographical or ethnological, are striking in the extreme. ""Behind us are the unwashed, barbarous *sans culottes* of the coast region, with fetishism, cannibalism, and the gin bottle in congenial union; before us lies a people astir with religious activity and enthusiasm, and wonderfully far advanced in the arts and industries."" Mr. Thomson took occasion to point out the enormous influence for good—though not unmixed—which Mahomedanism exercises among the inhabitants of the Central Soudan. On reaching Rabba in the Kupé country the river journey ended, and the journey to Sokoto had to be continued by means of the ordinary African caravan. The difficulties with the porters were described and the countries traversed were sketched, the route being through Kupé and Yauri to the Gulbi-n-Gindi, which is then followed to the neighbourhood of Sokoto. In conclusion, the author described the commercial prospects of these parts. He expressed the opinion ""that in all the wide range of tropical Africa there is no more promising field for commerce than this semi-civilized region which forms the central area of the Niger basin."" He came to this conclusion not on the ground that it is more fertile or more rich in natural productions—though in those respects comparing favourably with other parts—but for other reasons. These may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) It is more densely populated than any other part of Africa, and divided into powerful and, in Africa, exceedingly well-governed empires, in which life and property are almost as sacred as in Great Britain. (2) The peoples are far advanced in civilization, and throughout Northern Africa are famed for the excellences of their various manufactures. (3) The necessary machinery and organization to work the inland trade is ready to hand, as the Houssa trader is famed for his commercial genius and enterprising spirit. (4) An efficient transport service already exists, as the horse, camel, bullock, and donkey flourish in their thousands. (5) Owing to the much sterner conditions under which the people live, labourers are to be found without stint.

There is no reason to doubt a statement made in a recent number of the *Spectator* that ""the negro tribes in Africa are becoming Mussulmans fast,"" and that the converts to Islam ""are numbered by the thousand for every Christian ten."" There is much independent testimony to the same effect. Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own."" ""We hear of whole tribes laying aside their Devil worship, or immemorial fetish, and springing at a bound, as it were, from the very lowest to one of the highest forms of religious belief.""'}, {'id': 6283, 'article_title': 'The French in Africa', 'full_section_title': 'The French in Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1893#article-4', 'issue_date': '02_01_1893', 'content': '**5**\n\n---'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Introduction and Progress of Mohammedanism in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Before closing this cursory view of Northern Africa, it is interesting to trace the triumphs of Mohammedanism in names which survive to the present day. After the first violence to which fanaticism prompted, the Saracen sway assumed a milder aspect, and their princes cultivated the arts and sciences with a zeal which had expired among the effeminate descendants of the Greeks and Romans. Not only did they establish splendid literary institutions in Egypt, one of which at Alexandria is said to have had 600 professors, but even Mauritania, which seemed doomed to perpetual barbarism, became a civilised empire, and its capital, Fez, became a distinguished school of learning. They founded several flourishing kingdoms in those parts of the continent which Europeans vainly sought to reach, till they were recently explored by their enterprising countrymen. Of these states Shana (Kanoh of Dr. Barth) was the most prosperous, forming the great market for gold, in search of which merchants repaired from the remotest regions. Its sovereign was acknowledged supreme by all the neighbouring princes; while his court displayed a splendour hitherto unknown in those regions. The vicissitudes of fortune, however, have subverted the kingdom of Shana, and made it tributary to Timbuctoo, Kashna, and Socatoo. Dr. Barth, a few years since, found it a considerable town, with the name of Kano, manufacturing 600 thick cotton sheets a-year.\n\nTocrur was the centre of another kingdom. It was inferior to the other, but powerful. It carried on trade with people in the remotest west, who brought shells and brass in return for gold ornaments. Mention is made of cotton cloths also made here. This is most probably the modern Saccatoo, now the most important town in central Africa. Indeed, Major Denham, in an official document, called this the empire of Takror.\n\nKuku, to the east of Shana, forms another kingdom, on whose power and extent the Arabian writers largely dilate. The sovereign is said to have a large train, and the merchants to be very rich and accustomed to hold intercourse with the nobility. This country is evidently modern Bornou, from its capital, which still bears the same appellation.\n\nTo the south of Shana lay Wangara, a district said to abound in gold. This region is said to be intersected and overflowed by branches of the Niger, which impregnate the earth with the sand whence the precious metal is extracted. As soon as the waters have retired, the inhabitants eagerly dig the ground, and every one finds more or less, ""according to the gift of God.""', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Introduction and Progress of Mohammedanism in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Beyond the limits of their own empire the Romans had little communication with any people except the inhabitants of Fezzan and Nubia, and at a very late period with Abyssinia or the kingdom of Axum. Nor did Christianity seem to have extended her light far toward the centre, west or south of Egypt. Her benefits, spread over the north, disappeared here under the effects of disastrous wars. To Mohammedanism was reserved the task of effecting a change in Central Africa. The fanatic Arab mounted on the active dromedary, or embarked in light vessels, flew to plant the standard of his Prophet on the banks of Senegal and on the shores of Sofala. No people ever possessed such qualifications for conquering and preserving the empire of Africa. Among the Mauritanians and Numidians they found natural friends and brothers, and identity of manners, food, and genial climate. The fanatic Mussulman spirit astonished and subdued the ardent imaginations of the Africans; the simplicity of their creed suited their limited intellect, and easily connected itself with the superstition of fetishism, and the ideas which these people entertained of magic and enchantments. Civil slavery and despotic government suffered no change, except that the Maraboots, or Mussulman priests, and the shorifs, or descendants of the Prophet, formed in some of the states a species of aristocracy. Cannibalism was alone abolished. One event for a moment favoured the civilisation of the Moors—the expulsion of those of their number who had ruled in Spain, peopled Barbary, and even the oasis of the great desert with a more industrious and better-informed race than the rest of the Mohammedans. But unhappily for Africa, a handful of Turkish adventurers, vying with one another in ferocity and ignorance, established themselves on the coast of Barbary, subdued the Moors, and founded the barbarous governments of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, forming a deadly barrier to the civilised world, more efficient than Mohammedanism itself.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As to the elevating effects of Islam, hear the evidence of Mr. Joseph Thomson, the African explorer, who writes, he says, ""as one having the interests of Christianity deeply at heart.""

Dealing, first, with European influences, Mr. Thomson says: ""It is a painful fact to admit, but there is no shirking the naked reality, that in West Africa our influence for evil enormously counterbalances any little good we may have produced by our contact with the African."" He deplores ""the small headway Christianity is making, and the aptitude of the negro to adopt all that is evil in the white man.""

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the recent Church Congress held at Wolverhampton early in October, the Rev.

Its followers, and strangers, have ample materials in its history of thirteen centuries for measuring its merits and capabilities. Mahomedans will find scope for triumph as well as for shame. Their faith enjoyed a thousand years of great exploits and magnificent successes. It was a religion of the sword; and by the sword, for a thousand years, it prevailed. But Mahomedans themselves comprehend that only by armed violence can they propagate their doctrines. They perceive that for three centuries their ascendancy in arms has been fading away from them. For observers who, though not Mahomedans, are anxious to do Mahomedanism justice, the question will be what Mahomedanism has done for mankind at large, for others than Mahomedans, and for Mahomedans too. Like all powers which have been allowed to operate, Mahomedanism has had its uses. When Mahomet commenced his mission, Asia and Africa were in the depths of spiritual degradation. Arabia was a land of idolaters. The Eastern Empire was an incubus on the fairest portions of Asia and Europe, which, with its nerveless luxury and indolence, smothered all manliness and every instinct towards virtue. By some means or other, it was peremptorily necessary to sweep away the Byzantine throne and all that belonged to it. The Arabs, on whom the work first devolved, replaced the institutions they demolished by substitutes which stood the comparison. Arab civilization at Cairo, Bagdad, Damascus, Cordova and Seville was of a refinement which the Christian sovereignties it supplanted had not reached. Had Mahomedanism perished under an exertion of brute European strength against its Arab manifestation, it could not be now demonstrated to have been devoid at least of inherent vitality. The transfer of the Mahomedan representation to the Turk has revealed what Mahomedanism was and was obliged to be, whatsoever the hands which guided it. For the Turk as for the Arab, for the Arab as for the Turk, it was a religion which taught how to conquer rather than how to live. Its weapons might not be mere weapons of war. Mahomedan propagandists have won converts by persuasion and example. Pride in belonging to a dominant faith, and the emancipation it promises from castes and class distinctions, have united with the sword in extending the boundaries of Islam. Whether the new believers, however, had been recruited originally by hope or by fear, their belief has always seemed to expend its vigour in the first effort of bringing them within its fold. Mahomedanism as a religion supplied the impetus which acquired empires for the Arab as for the Turk. It did not bestow on the Arab the genius for arts and letters, which the dominion due to his religious enthusiasm enabled him to indulge. It did not incline the Turk to employ opportunities similarly obtained, and, more considerable still, for the education of his ruder nature to intellectual tastes. Christianity has insisted on mingling with every turn and aspiration of the human mind. Mahomedanism, while it claims to direct life, and is not without some doctrines and precepts worthy to direct it, has been satisfied to train the proselytes it has been constantly eager to enroll to despise others rather than to elevate themselves. As an art of life, and especially of social and national life, Mahomedanism has conspicuously failed. From the Koran an abundance of exalted maxims may be quoted which enjoin the practice of virtue, and even of benevolence. In every Mussulman community instances are to be discovered of persons endowed with exemplary Christian graces. No Mussulman State can be shown to have been established on a foundation which was not certain to develop the seeds of corruption and destruction.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Mohammedans on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Mohammedan advance on the West Coast of Africa is one of great social and commercial importance, and should be carefully watched by all interested in the politics and trade of that region. The increase of Mohammedanism at Lagos since the opening up of the Niger has been astonishing, for though when Lagos was taken by the English Mohammedanism was unknown there, now the principal portion of the native population is of that faith.\n\nThis increase of Mohammedanism is perhaps not much to be wondered at, as by the opening up of the Niger Mohammedan tribes who previously had no communication with the coast, and whose trade with the outer world was carried on by caravans across the Sahara and Soudan, made Timbukhtu their great trading centre. At that time the energies of the trader and the traveller were drawn away from the sea, and it was not until legitimate trade became possible from the discoveries and exertions of the English, and their suppression of slavery, that the Mohammedan trader turned his thoughts coastwards. Lagos may in some measure be considered as an exceptional case, and many would say that no attention need be paid to the extension of Mohammedanism there. No doubt the *laissez-faire* policy, which so unfortunately obtains in England with regard to African matters, might with impunity be adopted if Lagos were an isolated case, but the fact is, there is a great flood of Mohammedanism steadily pressing forward to the coast, and even in some places assuming a militant aspect.\n\nMr. Lewis, U.S. Consul at Sierra Leone, writing on the 14th of July, says that one Samuda is organizing a great army of 100,000 men in order to sweep away paganism, and that he believes he is called upon by God to rid his country of all hindrances to the religion of Mohammed.

He is one of those personages who suddenly appear in the history of Islam, to disappear as suddenly, and whose mission is to spread the rule of Islam and destroy the unbelievers. Samori\'s origin is dark. By some he is believed to be of the mysterious stem of the Fulas, by others of that of the Mandengas. It seems that he was early initiated into the duties of his \'mission\' by fighting under Hadscih Omar against the French on the Senegal. He has a special hatred against the French, and has warred against them during some years on the Upper Niger. His kingdom is situated on the sources of the Niger, and is almost wholly unknown. The only person who penetrated it was a native French sub-lieutenant, named Alla Kamessa, who visited Samori, in the town of Galaba, in 1881. When in 1879-80 the French sent an expedition to the Upper Niger, they came into indirect contact with Samori for the first time. Their operations being threatened, a captain was sent with the order to destroy the rebels. He reached Keneira, and pretended that he had beaten the \'disordered bands of the robber;\' but it is more probable that he only just escaped by a hasty flight. He was pursued by the enemy, and was obliged to leave his artillery behind him. Since that time there has been no peace between Samori and the French; and only a few weeks ago the Parisian press expressed serious fears as to the fate of the French on the Upper Senegal and Niger. Samori\'s soldiers had broken the telegraph from Bamaku—a proof that his power had extended farther to the north, and was becoming dangerous. At the same time he had turned west, where his troops, as was reported by the United States Consul in Freetown, the capital of the English colony in Sierra Leone, had appeared north of the latter place. The same Consul computes Samori\'s army at 100,000 men, mounted and foot. As the German possessions on the river Dubreka, opposite the Isles de los Idolos, lie about 140 kilometres north-north-west of Freetown, it is possible they will soon be obliged to fight Samori in self-defence. In advancing west, Samori must have conquered the country of Fata Dshal, which was under the protection of France according to treaties concluded by Victor Gaboriaud and Dr. Bayol; so that Samori is at war with the French not only on the Senegal and Niger, but also on the Atlantic coast. It cannot be foreseen what dangers the various European colonies will incur from this advance of Samori, as his future success depends on his personality, and he may die before he can carry out his plans. To him, who is a Mohammedan, all Christians are unbelievers who ought to be destroyed. His advance to the coast is not only influenced by his religious notion, but also by love of conquest. He is a true warrior, and has learnt the value of European weapons of war, and he hastens to reach a place whence he can directly derive such material. The English factories will at first be rejoiced at the lively trade in weapons which will later be directed against themselves. We must be prepared for the probability in a few years of a war breaking out between Islam and Christendom on the Atlantic coast between Gambia and Sierra Leone, unless death carries off the Scheik Samori.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': 'Missionary work, during the period under discussion, was in its pion› eering phase. On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""It is in this context that one should seek to understand the role of traditionalist or 'nativistic' socio-religious movements in our period. Of particular relevance as we have seen already in some of the earlier chapters were the messianic movements which expressed indigenous ideologies as well as those which reflected Islamic and Christian ones. They were movements which were emancipatory in character, expressing what is essentially a universal phenomenon in situations in which communities had to express their dissatisfaction with their living conditions and a desire for regeneration. They represented an ideology competing against colonial› ism in so far as the latter represented a negation of indigenous culture and economic, social and psychological depression of the colonized. In the words of Lanternari, 'They reflect the anxieties and hopes of the groups that participate in them for a sudden and total transformation of their physical, social and psychological environment.' 16 Prominent examples of such movements in our period, some of whose activities have been discussed in Chapter 20 above, were Ethiopianism in South and East Africa, and the movement spearheaded by millenarian preachers in Southern and Central Africa, notably the Kitawala (African and Congo Watch Tower) with large following in the Rhodesias, spreading to the Congo (now Zaire) and Nyasaland (now Malawi); the Kimbanguist movement (founded in the Belgian Congo by Simon Kimbangu) with following in Belgian and French Congo and the neo-Kimbanguist Mission des Noirs founded in the Lower Congo by Simon-Pierre Mpadi. Otherwise known as the Khakists, the movement had influence among the population of French Congo and Oubangui-Chari (now Central African Republic). Some of these movements were inspired by their acceptance of Christianity but were disenchanted with the expression of the religion in the organized Church of the colonial societies. African nationalists who were anxious to preserve Africans against colonial oppression found the Church at best indifferent. They therefore broke away very much in the spirit of the Reformation which has been characteristic of the growth and spread of Christianity in many societies. Like the reformation movements in Europe and elsewhere, the churches and movements founded by African National› ists aimed at applying Christian ideologies like the ideas of the brotherhood of man and the essential oneness of believers, without distinction as to race or colour, to end discrimination and oppression."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': ""Virtually all the independent churches traced their origin to the Zionist and Ethiopian movements in neighbouring South Africa and Rhodesia.

The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric.

An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures.

Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities. Besides, the movement provided the seed for African nationalism which was later to germinate and blossom into the struggle for independ› ence and its final achievement in the 1960s.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary.

I was able, however, on my journey to and fro along the coast to make some special investigations with regard to the liquor traffic, and in view of the great urgency of this subject at the present time I venture to offer a few observations on this most important subject. The great difficulty at the present time is the unequal competition of the various political divisions into which West Africa is divided. The low duties, for instance, in force in the German possession of Togoland and that of French Dahomey render the protection of the frontier in each case exceedingly difficult, and at any time this unfortunate state of things may lead to international complications. For this reason I would urge in the strongest terms the necessity for immediate action to be taken to secure international agreement, if only that this undoubted cause of friction may be removed, and that there may be agreement between the Powers who have taken possession of tracts of land in Africa. It can hardly be wondered at that Natives of Africa regard the profession of benevolent intentions which have been put forward with much éclat at the Berlin and Brussels Conferences as, to say the least of it, verging on hypocrisy. . . . It has often been suggested that in appealing for action we are opposing the true interests of British trade. On the contrary, it is clear that in seeking for international agreement as to this matter we are really asking for justice to British trade, as it is well known that Great Britain leads the way in the amount of duty levied on alcohol in the British possessions in West Africa, and Mr. Alfred Jones, of Liverpool, who probably has as much interest in West African trade as any other living man, supported this view strongly at the annual meeting of the Native Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee at Grosvenor House in May last. . . . It is not true, I am thankful to say, that the whole of our West African dominions are utterly demoralised by the drink traffic. Happily the evidence which I have obtained points unmistakably to the fact that only a small part of the territories under our control has been much affected by the spirit trade, as the difficulties of transport render the carriage of spirits far into the interior a difficult matter; but we have evidence that the area is rapidly increasing. With the opening up of roads and the development of railways, and the greater security of travel, drink is finding its way where it had not penetrated before. Now it is in our power to prevent the evils which are too well known in this as in other countries as arising from spirits. In a few years\' time it will be too late if the matter is not dealt with immediately. I cannot close without referring to the splendid stand made by the Royal Niger Company, who, as is well known, have prohibited the import of spirits into the greater part of their territories. From personal experience I know that this is faithfully carried out; and, though some smuggling does occur, in spite of the competition of neighbouring possessions the greater part of Niger is practically free from the evil of the liquor traffic.""', 'last_edit_date': '1897-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Rev.

He may speak to them lovingly and tenderly as only lips moved by a heart burning with compassion can speak, but it is yet the voice of a stranger.\n\nThe Native Church, thus planted and supporting itself, is determined by the help of God to conquer the evil of this place, to resist the assaults of Satan, to win souls unto Christ, and to become a grand centre of evangelisation and civilisation to the interior countries. All natives therefore must know that in this great work we are all fellow-labourers, and cannot free ourselves from its responsibilities. It is not confined to the missionaries and pastors alone; it is all, both lay and clerical.\n\nOur duty, my dear friends and countrymen, is a solemn one, for religious privileges involve also religious duties. Let us aid the pastors in every possible way, and give for the promotion of God's glory and the well-being of our fellow creatures.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns.

The deputation sent out here by the Mission Board to investigate the causes of misunderstanding in the Mission, arrived here on December 1, and worked hard until the 24th, when they intimated their decision to the parties concerned, the substance of which is as follows: ""That two of the native teachers be censured for being too friendly to Mr. Ross; that Mr. Anderson be admonished for helping Orök to write letters home against Mr. Ross, and for having written indiscreet letters to a female agent; and that Mr. Ross return to Scotland,"" &c. At this decision the congregation and Mr. Ross\'s numerous friends were indignant, and asked, ""Why, what evil has he done? Let us hear it!"" That very day the whole session—five teachers and all the church members (a few slaves, ignorant alike of civil and religious liberty, excepted), and Mr. Ross—resigned all connection with the Mission, and reorganized themselves at once into a congregation, and met next day (Sunday) for worship in Prince Eyamba\'s yard. Next day the Henshaw Town chiefs joined the disruption party. This unexpected step, though pre-warned of it, was very mortifying to both deputies and missionaries having an empty church to preach in. One of the former was very ill after he saw the result of their work, and it hastened, if it did not cause, his death on the voyage homewards (for he died near Grand Canary). There is a coloured missionary from Jamaica, with slight knowledge of medicine, in Creek Town, and the deputies acceded to his wish by sending him to Duke Town to help the other missionaries to entice the people back to the deserted church. He has now been over three months at his work, and has not succeeded in bringing a single individual back to the church. The people prefer rather to pay for Mr. Ross\'s teaching and medicines than to have his for nothing. Before the deputies quitted the African shores, Mr. Ross and his congregation were worshipping in the new church built for them by one of their elders, Prince Eyamba. In addition to this noble work, the Prince heartily gave his own new house to Mr. Ross. The Henshaw Town chiefs are building a handsome church for Mr. Ross and his congregation, to which they intend to remove, and use the present church for a schoolhouse. Mr. Ross is a man of an indomitable spirit, great energy, and perseverance, and, being liberated from the annoyance which he has been unjustly subjected for our sakes for the last five years (qualities which we natives admire), we expect soon the new Mission will equal, if not surpass, the old. Already he has two stations in Calabar, and one inland; and he is just now making arrangements to settle two evangelists next month in virgin soil, where he has obtained mission land from the chiefs, as the first missionary they ever saw; and I am sure, Mr. Editor, as a benefactor of my race, you will wish him God-speed! One thing irritated us natives very much in connection with the visit of the deputies—that they never visited a single Christian in Duke Town, Mission Hill, nor Henshaw Town, and would not hear our complaints against some of the missionaries, and treated our several petitions sent home in favour of Mr. Ross with contempt. They visited Orök, notwithstanding his brothel in the creek and at plantation for married European traders. But we Africans as we are, let the deputies and missionaries know that we can think and act for ourselves, and that we are not so easily trampled upon as they suppose. Mr. Ross informs me that he has written and sent home the whole palaver for publication. There is a lull just now in town affairs.

Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation.

As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

What they have found bears little resemblance either to the \'fanatical witch-doctors\' of colonial reports, or to \'the magic of despair\'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that \'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for ""primary resistances"" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.\' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. \'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine\'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the \'high priestess\' was dismissed and executed. \'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.\' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west. Some› times it happened because of the influence of Christian ideas - and Hendrik Wittboi drew upon Protestant Christianity for his doctrine of sovereignty, while an African independent Christian prophet was active among the Nama at the time of their rising against the Germans.

The followers of the Orkoiyot in Nandi remained active and watchful and the Nandi were repeatedly mobilized by this prophetic leadership to resist the abuses of colonialism over the years.$^{4}$ Similarly colonial archives from Kenya are full of references to witch doctors and laibons creating trouble in Marakwet, Kericho and Samburu.

But as the first decade wore on into the second, colonialism appeared to be gaining in strength; to many, indeed, it appeared as if the worst of the evils had come to earth. The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric.

Of particular relevance as we have seen already in some of the earlier chapters were the messianic movements which expressed indigenous ideologies as well as those which reflected Islamic and Christian ones. They were movements which were emancipatory in character, expressing what is essentially a universal phenomenon in situations in which communities had to express their dissatisfaction with their living conditions and a desire for regeneration. They represented an ideology competing against colonial› ism in so far as the latter represented a negation of indigenous culture and economic, social and psychological depression of the colonized. In the words of Lanternari, 'They reflect the anxieties and hopes of the groups that participate in them for a sudden and total transformation of their physical, social and psychological environment.' 16 Prominent examples of such movements in our period, some of whose activities have been discussed in Chapter 20 above, were Ethiopianism in South and East Africa, and the movement spearheaded by millenarian preachers in Southern and Central Africa, notably the Kitawala (African and Congo Watch Tower) with large following in the Rhodesias, spreading to the Congo (now Zaire) and Nyasaland (now Malawi); the Kimbanguist movement (founded in the Belgian Congo by Simon Kimbangu) with following in Belgian and French Congo and the neo-Kimbanguist Mission des Noirs founded in the Lower Congo by Simon-Pierre Mpadi. Otherwise known as the Khakists, the movement had influence among the population of French Congo and Oubangui-Chari (now Central African Republic). Some of these movements were inspired by their acceptance of Christianity but were disenchanted with the expression of the religion in the organized Church of the colonial societies. African nationalists who were anxious to preserve Africans against colonial oppression found the Church at best indifferent. They therefore broke away very much in the spirit of the Reformation which has been characteristic of the growth and spread of Christianity in many societies.

'His powerful mind and religious genius ... moulded a body of doctrine which was to serve as an ideological dynamo for the Xhosa nation.' In some ways Makana's teaching was an African version of the Protestant Christian ideology of sovereignty, which later gave Wittboi confidence in the divine right of the Red Captains. Makana explored the fundamental differences between black and white - different customs, different divinities, different destinies. The creator was Dali'dephu, great ancestor of the Xhosa, who had made Uthixo to be the god of the white men. Uthixo was an inferior to Dali'dephu, and the white men were morally the inferior of the Xhosa - continually vexed with the idea of sin. But this difference did not matter until the two moral universes came into contact and into conflict; then Dali'dephu would assert himself to ensure that his own particular children, the Xhosa, and their own particular and superior way of life triumphed over the super› ficial powers of the whites. Makana appealed for pan-Xhosa unity; for confidence in their moral universe. Dali'dephu would sweep the whites away; the Xhosa dead would return; 'a new era would begin'. 26 Conceptual and symbolic innovations such as Makana's had a relevance which long outlasted the particular resistance with which they were first associated. So far from being desperate nonsense, prophetic messages of this kind were a systematic attempt to widen and redefine the idea of deity and its relation to the moral order, and involved wide-ranging changes in Xhosa internal assumptions and relationships as well as providing the 'bedrock of ideology for resistance'. Peter Rigby has argued strongly against the idea that African prophetism was 'merely the result of exogenous forces of disruption during the colonial period' or sprang 'from a breakdown of African religions'. Prophetism was certainly, in his view, very much a matter of protest, and had played 'a major part in most protest movements in Africa', but the prophet emerged 'not merely as a reaction to exogenous experience but upon the grounds of the viability and adaptability of African religions'.$^{27}$ With this view of African religious systems regularly able to throw up prophetic leadership out of their own tensions and potentialities, and of prophetic"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The role of religious ideas', 'content': ""Seen from the perspective of the history of resistance the inward-turning focus of much prophetism, which identifies the source of evil as internal sin rather than external oppression, may seem like 'false consciousness'.

Thus Professor B. A. Ogot has taken issue with those who interpret Kenyan prophetic movements as essentially anti-colonial. He writes of one such prophet, Simeo Ondeto, that he was indeed 'revolutionary' but that his revolution was in the moral rather than the political sphere and was to take place within the individual. The essence of prophetic movements, writes Ogot, is that they are 'transforming spiritual and social agencies creating new communities capable of facing the challenges of the modern world'.$^{33}$ The great prophetic ideologies of resistance thus fall into place as part of a larger attempt to redefine the moral basis of society."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Christianity served a similar purpose, providing a cultural framework for creating a Creole society out of disparate groups of peoples settled in Freetown and surrounding villages, as in various settlements on the Liberian coast, or in Libreville, Freretown, and other freed slave settlements.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

But Cynthia Brantley Smith, in her admirable and exhaustive account of the Giriama, establishes that she was no sort of religious leader: merely a respected and assertive woman.$^{28}$ This is a case in which a retranslation of colonialist terms like 'witch' and 'witch-doctor' is not enough to correct the distortion of official accounts. It has been suggested by two researchers on Ndebele and Shona history that the same is true of my own account of the 1896 risings in Southern Rhodesia; the British South Africa Company said the risings were fomented by 'witch› doctors'; I argued that they were powered by a profound prophetic ideology; Julian Cobbing and David Beach assert that the spirit mediums were of much more restricted influence than I allowed and that the priests of Mwari participated in the risings hardly at all.$^{29}$ It will perhaps not be found surprising that I am unready for such drastic revisions. But it certainly is true that recent work on African religion in Southern Rhodesia shows that its relationship to resistance cannot have been so straightforward as I had supposed. It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements.

The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities.

These facts were at the time only suspected, but within the last few days they became matters of certainty. It appears that the King of Ashantee had arranged with Darko Yaw to come over to his side with all his chiefs and people, and in case the latter should decline to join, Quacoe Duah promised to send a small but efficient force to escort Darko Yaw and his immediate adherents within the Ashantee lines; after which a larger army was to proceed without delay to reduce the refractory Aquamboe chiefs to subjection, and then the whole were to march on to Accra through the Aquapem Mountains.

The chiefs at once assembled, consulted together, and resolved to act promptly, as the next day would see their King in the midst of the Ashantee force sent to escort him. It was agreed that they should go to the King, there and then, and if he could not give them a satisfactory account of his recent conduct, they should at once kill him. They went to his palace, and told him that they had come to consult with him what was best to be done to avert dangers that appeared to be coming upon them from different quarters, alluding to the threats and suspicions of the British Government and their native allies, that they were going over to the enemy.

The King upon this displayed great uneasiness, and endeavoured to treat the matter as a joke, but the chiefs insisted on the production of the trophies, which, however, were not forthcoming.

Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own."" ""We hear of whole tribes laying aside their Devil worship, or immemorial fetish, and springing at a bound, as it were, from the very lowest to one of the highest forms of religious belief.""', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Laying the Foundation-stone of Palm Church, Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Thus we made the preliminary endeavours towards the noble work whose further expansion we are here met to commemorate.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Thomson agrees with Dr. Blyden as to the causes of these astonishing results.

Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual.""

Mr. Blyden dwells particularly upon the superiority in manliness, self-reliance, and general moral tone of Mahomedan negroes over those of their race who have embraced Christianity. For this superiority—which, he says, all observers are compelled, however reluctantly, to admit—he assigns several causes, one of which is striking and suggestive. ""The Mahomedan negro,"" he says, ""has not been exposed to the depressing influence of Aryan art."" To the negro ""the painting and sculpture of Europe, as instruments of education, have been worse than failures. They have really raised barriers in the way of his normal development.""

If those results are not satisfactory, the means would be attentively examined and remedies suggested, wherever those means are found insufficient or defective.\n\nHis theory of the means and expectation of results would comprehend circumstance, time, and place. A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed. No wonder, then, that religion was, to the black man, invested with the garment of a trade, and this investment proved against the white man, in return, the greatest hindrance to progress and improvement."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.584, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the recent Church Congress held at Wolverhampton early in October, the Rev.

In his letter he tells us of some things we had not before heard. Mr Ussher seems by his report to have been in great pain shortly preceding his death, for the letter says, “He was heard, hard by the Castle, growling from the effects of his disease, and at death he was buried in a plain-dressed (unfurnished) coffin, and had the ill-fortune to be interred without the reading of the burial service.” Now this, if true, is, we think, a just cause of deep reproach to the other officials at Accra. What! could not one of them exert himself to obtain the assistance of a missionary, or himself read the beautiful service appointed by the Established Protestant Church? We could scarcely have believed it possible for British officials, under any circumstances, thus to fail in the last token of respect for a late chief, whom but a few hours before they may have been ready too obsequiously to serve. Our correspondent does not say that there is any necessary connection with the above and his letter, but it seems to us that there was a connection in his mind between the two statements. He says, “To this may be added that during his lifetime he was often seen on Sundays with his rifle over his shoulder going hunting or sporting, in utter disregard of the duties of the Sabbath.” Although, perhaps, there are not other high officials of the British Government on the West Coast who would thus show the “utter disregard” thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher, we have thought it well to print these observations that they may see how such conduct, when it does occur, is noted and commented upon by the Africans, who have been educated in the Missionary Schools, and who are taught to look upon the British as a Christian Government, and upon British Government officials as representing in Africa a British community one of the great characteristics of which is an abstention on the first day of the week from all ordinary secular amusements and employments, except where circumstances may make the latter absolutely necessary. And we cannot refrain from expressing our deep regret that any British Government officials on the West Coast should set such an example as is thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher. As representing such a community as that of Great Britain, we certainly think it their duty to “affect a virtue even though they have it not.” It is true we cannot charge the British Government with having done much to promote education among the West African people, and therefore cannot accuse them of imparting a mere secular education which in Africa, we are quite sure, would produce most baneful effects, as affording a people whom it is proposed to release from the sway of the most debasing, degrading superstitions, increased means for the perpetration of evil, without bringing them under the really civilizing restraint of those higher principles of human action which the blessed doctrines and precepts of Christianity inculcate for the guidance of responsible human beings in their intercourse with each other. But we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, the propriety (as it seems, if what this correspondent reports be true, there is a necessity) of laying it down as a rule for Government officials in the British settlements on the West Coast that they shall not by their conduct neutralize the teaching of the Protestant missionaries, to whom the African people are indebted for all the education they have received. What we desire for Africa, and what ought to be at least desired for her by the British Government, is not only that she shall advance in civilization, but that the civilization in which she advances shall be a Christian one; and we do not think we ask too much of a Secretary of State for the Colonies in asking him to lay down such rules as we have above mentioned for the conduct of British officials holding appointments under the Crown in West Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.584, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

This highlights the colonial perspective, where European powers and missionaries viewed the spread of Christianity as a means of civilizing and improving African societies. However, the articles also reveal tensions and conflicts between African communities and colonial authorities, such as the quarrels between the Egbas and the British government, and the resistance to missionary activities.

What they have found bears little resemblance either to the \'fanatical witch-doctors\' of colonial reports, or to \'the magic of despair\'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that \'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for ""primary resistances"" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.\' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. \'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine\'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the \'high priestess\' was dismissed and executed. \'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.\' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west. Some› times it happened because of the influence of Christian ideas - and Hendrik Wittboi drew upon Protestant Christianity for his doctrine of sovereignty, while an African independent Christian prophet was active among the Nama at the time of their rising against the Germans.

In some ways Makana's teaching was an African version of the Protestant Christian ideology of sovereignty, which later gave Wittboi confidence in the divine right of the Red Captains. Makana explored the fundamental differences between black and white - different customs, different divinities, different destinies. The creator was Dali'dephu, great ancestor of the Xhosa, who had made Uthixo to be the god of the white men. Uthixo was an inferior to Dali'dephu, and the white men were morally the inferior of the Xhosa - continually vexed with the idea of sin. But this difference did not matter until the two moral universes came into contact and into conflict; then Dali'dephu would assert himself to ensure that his own particular children, the Xhosa, and their own particular and superior way of life triumphed over the super› ficial powers of the whites. Makana appealed for pan-Xhosa unity; for confidence in their moral universe. Dali'dephu would sweep the whites away; the Xhosa dead would return; 'a new era would begin'. 26 Conceptual and symbolic innovations such as Makana's had a relevance which long outlasted the particular resistance with which they were first associated. So far from being desperate nonsense, prophetic messages of this kind were a systematic attempt to widen and redefine the idea of deity and its relation to the moral order, and involved wide-ranging changes in Xhosa internal assumptions and relationships as well as providing the 'bedrock of ideology for resistance'. Peter Rigby has argued strongly against the idea that African prophetism was 'merely the result of exogenous forces of disruption during the colonial period' or sprang 'from a breakdown of African religions'.

Resistance called for mobilization, and in many regions religious leadership arose to fulfil this role. The era of primary resistance was also the era of the prophets. While the Africans lost the actual wars in the battlefield, the mood of resistance remained entrenched in the hearts of the many. The followers of the Orkoiyot in Nandi remained active and watchful and the Nandi were repeatedly mobilized by this prophetic leadership to resist the abuses of colonialism over the years.$^{4}$ Similarly colonial archives from Kenya are full of references to witch doctors and laibons creating trouble in Marakwet, Kericho and Samburu.

The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

The Iwe Irohin says (copied almost literally by ""An African,"" as before mentioned): ""One of these ferocious women had already had one of her hands cut off in endeavouring to get over the wall, when she discharged her musket with the other hand and killed an Egba; but at the same moment she received a severe cut with the sword, so that she fell back into the trenches."" ""The fierce struggle lasted about an hour,"" during which there was a continual roar of musketry, ""when the enemy retired a short distance, being unable to stand the fire of the Egbas any longer."" The loss of the Dahomans during this first hour seems to have been nearly 200 killed, seventy of whom were in the trench or ditch. ""The wounded were numerous, and were removed by the enemy, but many of them afterwards died. The work of destruction among the Dahomans during this hour was frightful. The battle was by this time pretty well decided, and Abeokuta saved; as soon as the enemy retired from the walls, the Egbas rushed out and renewed the battle in the open field. The Egbas fought nobly; they knew what they were fighting for; all depended on this day; if defeated, they have no friends near; they fought for their homes, their wives and children, their country, their liberty, and their lives. For many years past the Dahomans had carried destruction and slaughter into the Egba territory; they came now to make an end to the Egba tribe. The Egbas were exasperated, and each wanted to do his duty on this day. The men fought in good order, though they had only a few leaders; the women were singing and dancing, being sure of victory. They carried plenty of water and agidis to the camp to refresh the fighting men; many of them armed themselves with swords and kept near the walls in case their assistance should be required. A sharp fire was kept up for about two hours near Aro, the enemy gradually retreating and leaving great numbers of dead behind them. They retired towards Ibara, which town they had destroyed last year. At Ibara the Dahomans sought to make a stand, but could not, and many sought safety under cover of the thick bush there. They were greatly distressed for water; all the watercourses were dried up; the dust and heat of a midday sun, with a forced retreat, soon demoralised them. They were attacked in the flank by another party of Egbas, and lost many of their carriers, one of their cannon, and several hundred of muskets, many of which were quite new. Some miles beyond Ibara they had their encampment, which was evacuated; here the pursuing Egbas captured the King\'s horse and many other things belonging to him. Great numbers of prisoners, men and women, were taken all along the road; and in this encampment the second cannon was captured. Beyond Ishagga, a town which they destroyed two years ago (also on the 15th March), the Dahomans stood once more to check the Egbas in pursuing them. A severe encounter took place, in which several Egbas were killed and wounded, but the Dahomans had heavier losses, and were driven from the field, the Egbas still pursuing them closely, killing and catching many of them. It appears that the Dahomans had never before experienced such a total defeat. It is difficult to give the exact number of dead and of prisoners. From Abeokuta to Ishagga, a distance of about fifteen miles, above 1,000 dead were counted, whilst beyond that place it is said that the number of dead was still greater. The prisoners cannot be fewer than 1,000 or 1,200, some say above 2,000. The Dahomans were probably above 10,000, but one captive states that their number was 16,000. Thus the Lord has frustrated the diabolic plan of the Dahomans to capture Abeokuta, and many of the heathen recognise the hand of God in this complete defeat of their enemies. The people rejoice greatly and congratulate each other on their escape. The Lord God of Hosts said: ""Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.""'}, {'id': 1956, 'article_title': 'GOD WILL PROVIDE', 'full_section_title': 'GOD WILL PROVIDE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1870#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_12_1870', 'content': 'did flatter him with their mouth and lied unto him with their tongues."" Such an acknowledgment as we naturally make of God\'s overruling providence, on the occasion referred to, has much less the character of practical belief, than of an admitted possibility. It speaks with an ""if."" It admits that what revelation affirms *may* be true, much more than it asserts it *to be* true. And then it gives God the benefit of the doubt. Practically it goes but little further than this; if any further. And there have been occasions on which the ""doubt"" has very soon been suffered to appear. As when we were engaged in the Crimean war, upon which we entered with an exuberant national boasting and pride, provocative of Divine wrath, especially when it is remembered that the declared purpose was to prevent at any cost the extinction of the rule of a denier and enemy of Christ and his followers, our vainglory being punished by humiliation, a day of supplication and prayer was ordered. The war at an end, after much hesitation, a day of thanksgiving was appointed. But here the ""doubt"" plainly showed itself. Wealth was declared to possess its just claim as well as God; there should not be any day abstracted from the pursuits of wealth and set aside for this, but the thanksgiving should be included in the Sabbath service. He has a day already; what should we give him another for? Is this the way in which God would have been treated among us if there existed a practical belief in his ever active sovereignty? Assuredly not. Nor can he be pleased with such an acknowledgment as this. It is not, however, to be therefore inferred that even so imperfect an appeal to him is without efficacy. ""But he, full of compassion, forgave iniquity, and destroyed not; yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath."" But there is an awful difference in the merely turning aside the extremity of wrath, and that opening of the great fount of national blessings, that only awaits the constant exhibition of a practical belief to pour forth its rich and abundant streams.'}, {'id': 4728, 'article_title': 'PAGAN ROME', 'full_section_title': 'PAGAN ROME', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-24', 'issue_date': '01_11_1883', 'content': 'When a heathen was anxious to propitiate the gods, he requested the priest to offer a sacrifice on his behalf; for this the priest was always paid.⁷ We may easily imagine how readily the priests, in addressing themselves to a superstitious people, terrified by a sense of sin, would engage their votaries to multiply sacrifices. At one time, they would tell their people to cause prayers to be offered for the dead; the which prayers, they would remind them, had no efficacy unless paid for. How natural would it then be for the pagan son who loved his deceased father or mother to hasten to the religious teacher, and to empty his purse, in order to redeem his parent from the torments of the furies! At another time, the priests would recommend the sick and dying to bequeath them a certain sum by will, that by the devotions and offerings of the priests the gods might be made favourable to their souls after death. The superior clergy had other resources. The sovereign Pontiff, for instance, both levied imposts upon the public at large, and obtained largesses from private individuals. They went even so far in Rome as to protect the trade of prostitution, on the condition that the unfortunate women should give them a tenth of their gains. Thus for money they authorized crimes which they condemned in their temples, and justified practices which the light both of natural religion and of God\'s providence pronounces most profane in themselves, and most hurtful in their consequences.\n\nAnother source of great wealth to the sovereign pontiffs was the first year\'s produce of benefices, and which they retained for their own use. Thus the heathen temple became a house of merchandise; and we are reminded of the words of Christ to the degenerate Jews: ""It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves"" (Matt. xxi. 13).\n\nHappily, Christianity overthrows this bartering spirit in religion by a faith full of pure sentiments. Of this we may judge from the precepts given by our Master.⁸ St. Paul, himself an example of unwillingness to be a burden to the churches to which he ministered, charges Titus to select for bishops men who were known to be ""not greedy of filthy lucre.""⁹ Does not this religion bear the impress of divinity, just as the rapacious demands of pagan priests showed that they had not the love of truth in their hearts, and that they were, in fact, the ministers of an earthly and debasing superstition?\n\n*(To be continued.)*'}]","[{'document_title': 'Address of the Egbas at Bathurst to their Friends in Abeokuta', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We, the undersigned Egbas by descent, now located at Bathurst Town, St. Mary's River, Gambia, to the Chiefs, our brethren, countrymen, &c., bearing rule at Abeokuta, greeting:—\n\nWe cordially and sincerely wish you all grace and peace from God our Father, and his Son Jesus Christ.\n\nWhereas we have been informed, from undoubted and good authorities, that you, our beloved countrymen at Abeokuta, have recently been involved in quarrels with the British Government, and are ready to take up arms against them.\n\nWe, therefore, anticipating the dismal calamities, misfortunes, and distress that will inevitably result upon our nation from this quarrel, deem it an indispensable duty of sincere and affectionate brethren seasonably to interfere; and hope, by God's grace, to prevail on you with wholesome advice, in order that a stop might speedily be put to these impending and approaching evils.

Oh, that the true light would shine on those dark lands! Oh, that a nation should there be born in a day! This will, of course, follow the glorious second advent of the Great Messiah, the Crucified of Calvary, yet King of kings and Lord of lords; but we would fain have seen some small approach to it, some faint day-dawn glimmerings of it, in our own time. We hope for it even now, and hoping for, even as earnestly desiring it, our deep interest in the Egbas as a people is unimpaired. We do not regard it as a mere accident, that among the Africans delivered by British cruisers from the power of the foreign slave-trader, and subsequently introduced to the knowledge of the English language by education, and of Christianity by the teaching of zealous missionaries, the Akus should predominate in numbers; or that (so far as our knowledge on this point at present extends) they and the Eboes, their near neighbours in Western Africa, should have afforded superior evidence of the capability of the African to attain to and receive both secular and Christian enlightenment. We believe that God, in His providence, has so overruled events for special results; and shall not therefore be surprised to see some combined efforts, by these instruments thus specially prepared, for bringing such enlightenment to the native mind within the territories peopled by their race, as may prepare the way, among other things, to the adoption by the authorities of Abeokuta of those means of defence and security which the advanced civilization of Europe can and is ready to supply. The security of Abeokuta, its entire delivery from the cruel pest of Dahomey, ought to be an object near to the heart of all of them; and we often feel surprised that they have done so little hitherto, as a body, to bring their education, their enlightenment, their Christianity, to bear in an operatively beneficial way upon those of whom we have been writing. There are two objects that they ought to strive for, constantly and untiringly—and will so strive for, if their education and Christianity be worth anything—beyond those blessed individual influences on character and principle which ought to flow immediately from them. These two things are, the obtaining for Abeokuta, and the territory between it and Dahomey, that delivery and security without which nothing permanently beneficial can be hoped for; and the forming an easy and speedy land communication between Abeokuta and a point on the waters toward Lagos, to which the navigation is at all times open. These two things are intimately allied, for if such easy and rapid communication existed between Abeokuta and Lagos, it would be such an element of power to Abeokuta that the Dahomans would never thereafter think for a single moment of disturbing its industrial activity by their atrocious raids. We urge it as a duty upon all those who are connected with that country by ties of blood and birth, to employ combined as well as individual efforts for the accomplishment of this great end. Every one of those who have received the blessing of education ought to be an apostle of progress, and it will not be creditable to them should they still remain inert as regards great public objects, and only careful and enterprising in matters concerning their own personal advantage.', 'last_edit_date': '1875-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1875#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abeokuta, Okeodan, and Addo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are sorry not to be able to give the entire contents of our correspondent\'s letter. He refers to a notice inserted by us in October, 1862, relative to the war and destruction of Ijaye, and of the conduct of the Abeokutans during the siege of that place. Our readers will, perhaps, remember that Ijaye, of which no vestige now remains, was a town of about 50,000 inhabitants. We deeply regret to hear from him that the worthy and truthful missionary to whom we were indebted for that account of the villanous conduct of the Abeokutans and Egbas generally, in that affair, brought great disfavour upon him when he returned to Abeokuta a few months after. Europeans and natives, merchants and missionaries, were a little surprised and indignant that he should have made such revelations in the columns of the *African Times*. Why? Because there was untruth in them? Far from it. Our clever Badagry correspondent tells us it was their *truthfulness* that constituted the offence of the single-minded missionary. It is the old tale; the truth calls forth persecution. And although we are grieved at the unpleasantness created for the truthteller in Abeokuta by his condemnatory revelation in our columns, we are not surprised at it. We have long known but too well that there are a number of very worthy persons there who have for many years placed quite a *couleur de rose* account of the Egbas before the civilised world. They evidently made it their study to conceal the much that was bad, and to praise unduly the little that was good. The Egbas thus won *bon marché* the favour of the good people of England, and profited largely by it. Too many of our kind-hearted philanthropists believed the good tiding. They were such pleasant things to hear. Even Lord Palmerston was deceived into praising Abeokuta ""as a centre of civilization""! Alas, our Badagry friend gives a very different account, and one that tallies with the condemned missionary one. He says that, to his knowledge, the Egbas violently opposed all missionary movement *beyond* Abeokuta; that they wished no white men to establish themselves beyond it in the interior, and calculated that if they could conquer Ibadan, no white man would go beyond them, and that all Yoruba would be open to them for their kidnapping expeditions. Our friend says that we were all systematically humbugged about the Egbas, who have been, and are wherever they can practice it, as notorious kidnappers—menstealers—as any people in Africa can be. Of course, our friend is indignant at the stoppage of trade, &c., but we do not believe that this warps his judgment. We feel with him, that ""it was not at all astonishing that an English anti-slavery Government at Lagos should displease Abeokuta."" To make Lagos a British colony was a great crime in Egba eyes, as the taking other towns (Okeodan, &c.) now under our protection is another.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Truth as to the Dispute between the Egbas and Ibadans', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Ibadans long since have been anxious to get their communications with Lagos, or with any seaport, that they may carry their trade independent of other countries, as Egbas and Ijebus; but those two nations try to monopolise the trade between themselves, and buy from the Ibadans and the interior, and take it straight to Lagos, even to England. The Ibadans tried to buy grog instead of rum or gin, as the Ijebus and Egbas water it so much that the purchaser scarcely gets 12 degrees spirit, and selling pieces of cloth 25 yards instead of 30, and so on. But, above all, some time ago they refused to sell them salt, powder, guns, &c., which is a sign of hostility; so much so, that Mr. Editor will remember that that was the quarrel of the Egbas with Captain Glover, when he stopped powder and guns against them in 1871-72. All this is almost nothing in comparison to others. In 1872-73, I was in Abbeokuta, when Chief Warrior Akodu sent to Kobits (Abbeokuta is a big market in the middle town) to take and plunder Ibadan people several times; once it met me in the very Kobite; and these Ibadans he used to chain and sell with their goods plundered. Once Oguée, another war chief (for there are thousands of them in Abb) plundered and caught several Ibadans, in the midst of whom was a woman with child. As Oguée knew that this trick would be discovered, and that he shared with nobody the plundered goods, consequently had no backstay as Akodu, he took these poor people and killed them all. The Egbas used to pass through Ibadan to Ilorin with thousands of pounds worth of goods, but the Ibadans never troubled them; the poor Ibadan people come to Abbeokuta with a single bag of kernal or bag of seed cotton to buy a bag of salt, are captured, and sold at once by the peaceable Egba. Can a gentleman like Mr. H. Robbin, though of Egba pure blood, as I am, deny this? As a gentleman, I trust he will speak the truth. Every day, similar plunders of the Ibadans by the peaceable Egba occurred, till lately one War chief, called Ajagunjungun, plundered some Ibadans\' property; they begged and begged, but with no result. Chief Ogundipe interceded and opposed, though himself an Egba and heathen; never joining them nor approving their doings, as Mr. ""Native"" and others do. Tired of their going and coming, the Ibadans sent to their King Alafin (King of all the Yorubas) to intercede for them. The King of Oyo (Alafin), knowing how stubborn are the Egbas, sent Sango-fetish (Thunder-god), with his messenger, to the Egbas, begging them, through Sango, which, according to heathenism, is the most solemn request; but the Egbas refused (or Ajagaujeuru), for any single Egba is a king, a chief, an all in all. The Ibadans then determined not to go to Abbeokuta again for commerce, as they say in their own language, ""they want no neighbourhood war in future after the Ijaye war""; so they sent to the King of Porto Novo to tell him (with Alafin messenger) that they would pass through Imeko to his country, to buy their necessaries. In this message there were Royal gifts on both sides, and rejoicings by the King of Porto Novo, who wants to be freed from the Egbas, for all the neighbourhood is against the Egbas. Perhaps Mr. ""Native"" will point out to me who are the Egbas\' friends in this part of Africa but England; and they have well paid them (five days from date will make ten years since). On the return of the Ibadans, the Egbas sent a chief warrior, called Ogundeyi, to plunder them, but Ogundeyi being a coward, as all the Egba war-chiefs are, hid himself in the bush till the Ibadans went away, and then told the Egbas that he did not find them. Of course they all knew it well, but dare not say it, as none are able to do more. So the Egbas blockaded their roads against Ogundeyi\'s wish, and sent to the King of Ijebu (with flattering words, such as ""you are our father,"" of our all and all"") to do the like as they have done in 1872 against Lagos. All the Ibadans then could not help but to show the Egbas that they are men, and even not so coward as the Egbas, declared war against them, not against the Ijebus, until the Ijebus provoke them;', 'last_edit_date': '1877-10-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1877#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS, ABEOKITA, AND PORTO NOVO.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'About the middle of February I was in Abeokuta, a city three days\' journey, or seventy miles to the interior, with a population of 150,000.

I said to a great many persons that they ought to throw away their gods, serve the Great God, and become Christians, but they would generally say, ""We will see about it after the war is over."" The great multitudes scorn the cause of Christ, and serve their idols. I went with a friend to Porto Novo, a city about the same distance from Lagos as Abeokuta. The city and its country have a population of 90,000. Soon after our arrival we went to salute the King (Tofa). We found him to be a very intelligent-looking man. We told him that we came to see if he would allow us to come and live in his country, build a school and chapel, and teach his people the Christian\'s religion. He said he only knew two religions—viz., the Wesleyans and Catholics; those were enough, and he wanted no other religion in his country. We attempted to tell him that we all taught the same religion, but he soon stopped us by saying, ""I have no more to say on the subject."" He is a great tyrant, and much devoted to his gods.

On leaving his palace we noticed in his yard some half-dozen or more gods. These gods are to be seen by the thousands. Many of the heathen temples are decorated with human skulls, which have been offered as sacrifices to the gods. In one of these temples I counted as many as thirteen. I saw a dog that had been killed, no doubt as a sacrifice, and tied to the neck of one of the gods in the market. A German merchant there had one of the native boys to steal some money from him. He took him to the King to be punished for the deed. The King said, ""All right; I will try by one of my gods; if I find him to be guilty I will punish him.""

In our last we gave important news from Abeokuta—important, at least, as regards the great Egba nation and the neighbouring British settlement of Lagos. We announce the death of the Bashorun of the town, the man who had for some years, in default of a king, exercised the chief power there. For seventeen years he had been in this position, to which he had risen by daring and energy, but the influence of old age had of late years made itself injuriously felt in his character, causing him to become vacillating and unstable, and enfeebling his mind and arm for government. This ought not to astonish anyone when we record his age. He was ninety-three years old when death removed him from among his people. If he had been only sixty-three instead of ninety-three, we should never have heard of such scenes as those enacted in October, 1867, when the Christian places of worship were pillaged, and missionaries who had laboured there during many years retired to Lagos. The death of the Bashorun is not, therefore, to be regarded as a calamity, for the Egbas, who will now again come under the rule of a king—Ayekon, of Ake, of whom report speaks as possessing qualities which inspire a reasonable hope that peace, prosperity, and industrial development will shed their blessings over the country subject to his authority, in the exercise of which he will be zealously assisted by the kings and chiefs forming the lately-constituted Egba Board of Management, which we may regard as a species of executive council of state, and which will, we hope, prove instrumental in establishing and consolidating institutions calculated to obtain for the Egbas internal tranquillity and external respect. Abeokuta, even in its comparative infancy, has proved an insurmountable barrier to the inroads and depredations of the Dahomans on that side of the country, as Ashantee has on the other; and we shall not be at all surprised if, in the course of a few years, such a people should no longer be content merely to resist and defeat the Dahomans when they invade their territory and come before the walls of their town, but, in a plan of enlightened self-defence, so bring the intermediate towns and peoples into voluntary obedience or friendly union, as to enable them to assume the offensive, break in pieces the already-enfeebled Dahoman power, which has wasted its strength in the bloodthirsty expeditions of its kings, and give something like assured peace to that naturally rich and fertile, but long oppressed and devastated portion of Africa. For all this it is necessary that there should be a true and lasting friendship between this people and the British settlement of Lagos. The British Government has entirely repudiated all desire of domination in that part of Africa. In Lagos, it can and will confer essential advantages upon Abeokuta and other Egba towns, and the Yoruba countries generally—the advantages of a secure and improved outlet for the products of the soil—the advantages of showing at its very door those improvements which civilisation introduces, and which tend so much toward the welfare, the happiness, and strength of a community—the advantages of having a wealthy neighbour able and willing to assist a rising, energetic people in its early and necessarily painful and suspicious efforts at consolidation, amelioration, and advancement. And as among the changes absolutely indispensable among the Egbas themselves to their progress and wealth, we hope that under a new and more enlightened government than they have hitherto enjoyed, their king and his assisting council may succeed in inducing them to abandon that impoverishing custom by which all that was the late property of the dead is dissipated in foolish ceremonies and debasing excesses, leaving his family and descendants stripped and penniless.

Who in this world would conscientiously vote for an endless and constant warfare, killing others, indirectly exposing oneself to every kind of danger, inconvenience, torture, and the sacrifice of human lives, unless compelled by absolute necessity so to do? The philosopher, ""Masotemos,"" has put Ibadans down as a blood-thirsty nation because they had destroyed Ijaye, but prejudice did not allow him to state also, if at all he has any knowledge of it, that that was the result of the latter\'s open rebellion against his Majesty Adelu, the lawful King Alafin, insisting upon his dying with his late father, his Majesty King Atiba, according to the old custom of the country, and which had since been amended as barbarous by the unanimous consent of the following bodies of men of rank—viz., the twelve Eshos (body-guard), the seventy Olojahs (barons), the Bashorun (generalissimo), the Kakaufos (field-marshals), and the four Ogtimohs (dukes), with all the lords temporal and the nobilities of the whole Yoruba realm, answering to the British members of Parliament and the continental senators of Europe. But the Kurumi, an Ijaye chieftain, had obstinately refused to agree to such an amendment, and would rather fight than submit to such a prince, whose father he had served before; so he declared war against the king, and the Ibadans were obliged to take up arms against Kurumi as a rebel and a traitor. All the time the Egbas were duly informed, as neighbours, of the conduct of Kurumi, and their intention to humble his pride, and left Abeokuta with an assurance, voluntarily given by the Egbas, with a solemn and sacred oath that they would assist the Ibadans; but no sooner had the latter left Abeokuta than the Egbas, after distributing the presents given them by the Ibadans, perfidiously and most treacherously set out against the Ibadans, marched onward to the valley of death, to be worthily paid by the God of oath, whose yea is always yea, and nay, nay. From Ijaye, the ""Masotemos"" mentioned the destruction of the Ijeshas; but perfect ignorance in that case, mixed up with prejudice, has a full display. The Ijeshas, during the Ijaye war, had so unwisely interfered, by stopping every source of getting provisions, against the Ibadans, and at times venturing to molest their caravans going to some other countries to obtain food; and their countrymen here in Lagos, Sierra Leone emigrants, joining with the peaceful Egba emigrants, collected money, and bought gun-shot and powder, and sent these things to the Egbas to help them to conquer the Ibadans. What for? No earthly just cause in the slightest degree; and I say, that if the Ijeshas have not all these to de-escalate, but a subdued country to live in, as the case is till to-day, whom have they to thank but themselves and the Egbas? The ""Masotemos"" thought that every other person is like unto themselves. Mr. Editor, who are those in Lagos now, in this instance, importing for this war rockets, needle-guns, and every other newly-invented war implement? Ask the Egba colony borns of Lagos and natives of Sierra Leone, too. I challenge them to publish the name of one Yoruba colony, born either of Lagos or Sierra Leone, who has ever sent a grain of powder, a single shot or gun, to the interior since this war broke out, or even before; but I am ready, and shall give you a list of more than twenty-four names of the Egbas who are capable of such ignominious conduct.

Now it is to be hoped that they will no longer stand in the way of the development of that part of Africa.\n\nOn June 11, we received from Lagos full details of the fighting which took place between the British troops and the Jebu Army, numbering over 10,000 men. After stubborn resistance at Kapashida, where the Government interpreter, Mr. A. C. Willoughby, was shot through the head, and Captain Hardinge received a wound in the thigh, the Jebus fled, leaving the towns of Eredo, Ayo, and Agushi in the hands of the British. The great battle was fought at Magbon. Captain Hardinge's wound was fortunately slight, and he kept leading his men. The Jebu Army was found to be strongly posted in the rear of the Oshun River, which was overshadowed by a dense forest. They were about 7,000 to 10,000 strong, and were well supplied with arms and ammunition. The British force had to pass through a ravine, in single file, with but a few inches footing. On each side was a thick wood, in which the Jebus were posted, and from which they poured out a continuous and heavy fire. The passage was so intricate that as the men fell, either killed or wounded, they had to be lifted out and placed on one side to allow the others of the force to pass. As soon as the British force reached the open, however, the Jebus had to fly with great loss. Now came the most difficult part of the operations. The enemy were on the opposite bank of the river. The native troops hesitated to go into the water in the face of such a hot fire as the Jebus were keeping up. At this critical...\n\nmoment, when the Jebus were full of determination, and it appeared as if the turn of events was doubtful, the special service and other white officers entered the river to lead the attack. Then up came the West India troops, and there was practically no other course left for the natives but to ford the river also. Captain Owen received two wounds in the head and one in the leg. When the troops reached the opposite bank the Jebus could not stand their withering fire. At the end of two hours the Jebu army was completely defeated, and the King was taken prisoner to Lagos. The British casualties were three killed and about forty wounded, including officers Owen, Hardinge, and Lawrie.

The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies. The impact of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work. As a result, the Scottish Free Church plunged for the first time into missionary work in Central Africa.

Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

Responding to the challenge of the new opportunities, German missionaries, mostly from the Basel Mission but with a few from the Bremen Mission, overcame their pietist hesitation and became involved in the politics of development in a British colony. They and their British colleagues found more opportunities as farm managers, linguists, teachers, builders, and promoters of commercial enterprises than as preachers. A number of mission stations were established, and leading individual missionaries became deeply involved in local political and racial conflicts; nevertheless, nothing like the Freetown success was achieved. Elsewhere, missionary organizations were being founded, and a few pioneer mission stations established in which preliminary educational efforts and linguistic studies were being undertaken that would yield fruit later.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889.

If there were not great interests of humanity, civilization, and Christianity at stake, we might laugh at the absurdity; but when we look at the results to be obtained by the civilization of Dahomey and of Ashantee, and see such a policy as that under consideration announced from England, our heart almost fails within us. Those two countries are being annually drenched with the blood of victims of an atrocious barbarism, and that blood flows, for the most part, not because of a wanton exercise of a savage despotic power, but at the behests of a most sanguinary superstition. And we prefer to cure these people by offering them the bribe, that if they will first become good, and righteous, and humane, and enlightened in their ideas, some half-a-dozen or more of them shall really be brought over to England to have the honour of a peep at us! If they will swallow our pill first, we will, perhaps, give them (""it will be time to consider his proposal"") a little jam and honey afterwards. And this is the way in which our Government, as a Government, thinks that African civilization may be accomplished. The English people, as individuals, know better. They do not say to the poor wretched victims of a cherished barbarous superstition, cast off your false religion, acknowledge two or three of the great truths of Christianity, and then we will see, perhaps, what can be done for you. No, they send their missionaries to tell them what Christianity is—to show them the difference between what it inculcates, and the bloody system under which they have been for so many ages the benighted victims. And why does not the English Government act on the same principles? Does official position, does official life, remove the members of a Government out of the sphere altogether of the principles and sentiments which would influence and govern them as individual Englishmen? It seems very much like this. We cannot send our civilization to Dahomey and Ashantee for them to look at it and contrast it with their own barbarism, as missionaries can show them the simple truths of Christianity, and ask them to compare them with the foul teachings of their Fetish priests. All the sample of civilization we can send them, after having encouraged their sanguinary systems for ages by our long and active prosecution of the slave-trade on their coasts, is war ships and cannon engaged in protecting legitimate trade, and putting down that slave-trade we so long encouraged and participated in; that according to the ideas of those people, we have only abandoned it because we do not want it any longer, and, like dogs in the manger, refuse to let others eat of what we do not ourselves require. Traders, eager, of course, as traders must be, in the pursuit of gain, ""guns, drums, trumpets, blunderbuss, and thunder,"" war ships, and an occasional missionary, are all the show of civilization we can make to them in their own lands. The mountain cannot go to Mahomet, but Mahomet can be brought to the mountain. We cannot extend civilization and its fruits to the Dahoman and Ashantee anywhere but in England. They begin to know and feel this, and are not at all so unreasonable as we are. They do not say, send England over here that we may look at it, but, take us over to England that we may see what it is. And we want them to see it, or, at least, we ought to want them to see it. What is there, then, that stands in the way? There is no doubt in our own mind on the subject. It would cost a thousand pounds or two, and a little trouble, to gratify their wish. And so this great and noble nation takes refuge under a false and hypocritical exaction. And, of course, it does not expect to be found fault with. What can be better than the things it asks the Dahoman to do? Renounce the slave-trade, give up human sacrifices, buy cottons, guns, powder, and rum, and sell palm-oil and such other articles as your country produces! Who can find fault with this? Not we; only the demand or advice is not likely to be granted or acted upon. The people want an adequate motive for the change demanded. We try to give them one when we endeavour by our ships to make it impossible for them to sell slaves for export. And they understand this motive, because they feel the power of its working. Why not add another motive? Why not show them England and its civilization? Have we no faith in ourselves, or our civilization, or our religion, so that we fear their being too closely looked at by strange eyes? No, it is not this, it is that ignoble motive of a little money, as if civilised Dahomey and Ashantee would not repay it to the country ten thousand times over. Away with it. Bring the Dahomans over, and England will not become bankrupt because she may have spent two or three thousand pounds in entertaining them.'}, {'id': 5956, 'article_title': 'The Position of Missionaries in the Niger District', 'full_section_title': 'The Position of Missionaries in the Niger District', 'last_edit_date': '02-01-1890', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_02_1890', 'content': '""Things have changed now. A majority of British people recognise that the power and vigour vouchsafed to them were not conceded by the Most High for the purpose of exporting liquor (of which sin we gladly acquit the Royal Niger Company), or making dividends of profit; but to benefit the subject people, and to give them the opportunity of accepting Christianity, which has made us what we are. The Niger Valley is not far from Great Britain. Public opinion will have its sway there. The missionaries were there before this Company came into existence, and will outlive it. The Mohammedans of the Soudan, whether Fulah or Negro, are pigmies in strength, culture, power, and population in comparison to the 50,000,000 of British India. The gentlemen of the Niger Company talk of the fanatical Mohammedan, in his turban, cloak, and trousers. The phenomenon is new to them, but Anglo-Indians have lived all their lives in the midst of noble, though fanatical, Mohammedans. Some as fair in colour as ourselves, and many much more learned and polished; some of gigantic stature, and hereditary warriors. Yet the Gospel has its free course amidst the Balúchi and the Afghan, the Patan, and the converted Mohammedan Rajpút; and the Empire of the Empress of India flourishes, because it is founded upon righteousness. Treaties with such clauses should be denounced as derogatory to the dignity of Great Britain, as if we were ashamed of the religion which has brought us such blessings. The thing is doubly offensive when we are told that we are allowed full leave to convert the Pagan; but must not address the Negro who has got himself up with the veneer of Mohammedanism, for it is no more. Their knowledge of Arabic and the Koran is scant; all the bad salient features of Mohammedanism are asserted, while the better things to be found in the Koran, and the learning and refinement of the polished Mohammedan of India, Persia, and Turkey are absent.\n\n""The public notice has been despatched, and Jan. 1, 1890, fixed as the date of the new policy. When a British subject is killed or imprisoned, something more than his life and liberty are lost to his country—viz., the prestige of our nation. The representative of the British Government in China remarked in 1873 that there was a necessity to protect the missionary from actual violence, but nothing more. The present Foreign Secretary two years ago told a deputation of missionaries that the Great Powers of Europe asserted the right to deport an alien without cause shown from their territories, but they would shrink from the charge of ordering his death, or imprisonment, without the form of a regular trial. For the sake of argument, we may concede that the Mohammedan potentates of the Soudan might deport a British missionary; but, when they hear there is no risk, they will certainly kill him.""\n\n---\n\nIn the next number of the Christian the following appeared:—'}]","[{'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Macaulay prefaced his remarks on ""England and her West African Colonies"" by stating that he hoped to be able to prove, in the course of his essay, the success attendant upon the ecclesiastical, political, and commercial efforts of British enterprise in the West African Colonies of England, and to picture their early history with the stubborn realities existing at the present time. Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES AND THE WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So entire has ever been our conviction that the rapid or feeble progress, the future good or evil, in West Africa depends on the character of Missionary efforts there, and of Missionary relations with the people, that it has been our constant endeavour to throw the weight of whatever influence we may possess into the Missionary scale. Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary. He has mistaken his vocation. He may be a very good man, he may have high and exalted motives, he may ardently desire the conversion of the heathen; but if human infirmities of mind and temper', 'last_edit_date': '1878-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1878#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ARRIVAL OF BISHOP STEERE AT ZANZIBAR, AND HIS PROGRESS IN THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The first idea of a mission was started, in response to an earnest appeal made by Dr. Livingstone, at a meeting at Cambridge, in 1857. It may be regarded as having been formally instituted at a second meeting at Cambridge, on the 1st of November, 1859. The first head of the Mission was Bishop Mackenzie, who established a station at Magomero, on the River Shiri, where a large settlement of slaves, liberated by the Mission party, was formed under the guidance of Dr. Livingstone. The appeal proceeds with a summary of the work that is being done by the Mission at the present time. 1. On the site of the old slave market at Zanzibar, purchased by the liberality of the Rev. A. N. West, of Pembroke College, who died whilst in sole charge of the Mission, Christmas-day, 1874, a fine church which is far advanced towards completion. Adjoining it the Bishop hopes soon to erect houses for the clergy and mission workers, schools, and a hospital. 2. At Mbweni, four miles from Zanzibar, a settlement of adult liberated slaves has been formed, and attached to this station is a girls’ school. 3. At Kiungani, two miles from Zanzibar, is a large boys’ industrial school, which is partly self-supporting. Much of the carpenter’s and other work for the fabric of the Zanzibar church has been done here. 4. A house in Zanzibar was opened as a hospital on Dec. 12, 1875, upon the arrival of Miss Allen and two nurses. It has already done excellent service. 5. Magila, the Mission station on the mainland, is in charge of the Rev. J. P. Farler and Mr. Moss, and has lately been reinforced by Mr. Clarke; the reports are favourable. Bishop Steere has just returned to Zanzibar after five months’ absence on an expedition to the Nyassa country. The details of this interesting journey, begun from Linoi (a point some distance south of Zanzibar, and the nearest part of the coast to Lake Nyassa), at the end of last October, and completed Jan. 21, 1876, will be found in a pamphlet printed at Zanzibar, and now issued under the title of “A Walk to the Nyassa Country.” This suggests the feasibility of extending the operations of the Mission over 300 miles or upwards on the mainland in the direction of the country first occupied under Bishop Mackenzie towards Lake Nyassa. It also affords convincing evidence of the existence still of the slave-trade in the number of caravans which were met. It reveals likewise, incidentally, the self-devotion and perseverance of the Bishop, who when the European members of his party failed him through ill health, started on the journey with native bearers only. The Bishop estimates that by this means some 10,000 slaves were conveyed to the coast. By God’s providence the journey was, notwithstanding difficulties and privations, accomplished safely. In a letter recently addressed by Bishop Steere to the members of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, he says: “I have just returned from a walk of some 700 miles, through almost unknown country, undertaken in your name and for your honour. I have agreed with the greatest of the native chiefs (Mataka) near the Lake Nyassa for a site and for countenance in our mission. I find that my appeal for personal help is being nobly responded to. We paid during the year 20 outward passages. I hear of four more, perhaps now on their way, and of others pressing to follow them. . . . There remain 14 of us, mostly young students, out of whom I feel no doubt the most efficient missionaries will ultimately be formed. Not one of my helpers is desiring money profit from his work.

In opening his address, the Archdeacon recalled the fact that five years ago, in the same building, he addressed a congregation on the same subject, and remarked that he had since then spent five years in East Africa, and was delighted to have the opportunity of speaking to an English audience of the further progress and development of the work. Thirty years ago the Universities\' Mission in Central Africa took its rise, owing its commencement to the statements of Dr. Livingstone. For the greater part of that time the mission work had been centred on the island of Zanzibar, and had taken the shape almost entirely of preparing students for the work of clergymen amongst their own races. An important epoch, however, had now arrived, and the first East African clergyman had been ordained in the course of the present year. At present the mission was spending its best energies in the training and foundation of native ministries, and they had as large a number of African helpers as they had European. The African helpers had remarkable steadfastness, and made very great headway in their work, and the mission had a large number of students who were pledged to seek orders at the proper time. He had come direct from the shores of Lake Nyassa, the most southern of the three great African lakes. It was the length of England, and had an average breadth of forty miles. It had a very large population on its shores, and in its centre, the headquarters of the mission was established on an island five miles long, three miles broad, and with a population of about 3,000 souls. With a large steamer and several boats the missionaries were able to cover a very large stretch of country, and amongst the tribes they came across no such things as idolatry or fetish were to be found. There were, however, the greatest superstitions and ramifications of witchcraft, and the ""\'ordeal\' was very paramount."" The natives had some belief in a creation, and in the personality of a great Being who had created them. Practically, they had no belief in God as an ethical Being, and they were really ignorant of sin, although they knew something of moral evil. They recognised murder and adultery as moral evils, and their rules punished these ""evils"" without recognising them as sins. They believed nothing about a future life, and although they had a great fear of death, that arose, not from fear of what was coming after death, but because of their intense liking for and great enjoyment of life. They did not believe in natural death, but always believed that death was caused by some living person. That belief resulted in dreadfully superstitious practises, which caused the death of some helpless person or persons. There was very great need for Christian work on the island. The mission had started schools for boys and girls. The great enemy was the indifference of the tribes to all religious matters. One of the great opportunities was the leisure of the people and their delight at being able to sit down and listen to something new. The results so far were not great, because heathenism was probably as old as the Flood, and could not be got rid of in a day; but the mission now had about sixty natives baptised and already communicants. They were really worthy and earnest Christians. All the great towns on the south of the island were being visited week by week, schools were maintained, and a very large number of children were being educated.

The chair was taken by his Excellency John D'A. Dumaresq, the Administrator. Prayer was offered by the Rev. T. J. Marshall, native minister, of the Wesleyan Missionary Society; and the report read by the Rev. J. B. Wood, Principal of the Church Missionary Society's Training Institution, and local Secretary of the Bible Society. His Excellency then addressed the meeting and alluded feelingly to the loss we have sustained in the death of the wife of the Rev. J. Milum, minister of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, which took place on the 14th inst. Interesting and telling speeches were made by the Rev. Mr. Davids, Baptist Missionary, Mr. C. B. Macaulay, Rev. James Johnson, Church Missionary Society, native pastor of St. Paul's; a short address by Rev. J. B. Thomas, native Wesleyan missionary; and the Right Rev. Bishop Crowther. Mr. Davids was understood to say that the British and Foreign Bible Society is a great unifier; that it prints the Bible for all, and not for any particular sect; that though there are various forms and procedure of worshipping God, yet we all agree in the Bible, which is the word of God; it Christianizes as well as civilizes us, as it did the Americans, &c.; and as freely we have received it, we ought to give to our neighbours freely. Mr. Macaulay said we should support the Bible; and as we all cannot be missionaries or preachers, yet, like Andrew, who called Peter, we could be instrumental, by sending the Bible to our fellow-brethren through the preachers, in getting souls converted unto God. Mr. J. Johnson told us that it is of the greatest importance that the Bible should be continued to be translated, printed, and read in the vulgar tongue of every country. It will be better understood, and enable us to contend against Mahomedanism. The Bible came to England in Latin, and the power of the Word of God was not properly felt or understood by the mass of the people until it was translated into the English language; and it was the Bible that made England so great and glorious, and raised such men as Wilberforce, Buxton, and others who labour for the emancipation of our race. He alluded to the wonderful effects of it in Madagascar, wherein the missionaries, when driven away, left the Bible with the people in their own tongue, and after twenty-five years the missionaries were sent for; they went, and met not a few, but hundreds of Christians, and so the Fiji people understood it in their own tongue. He contended that, as the African Church has failed once in North Africa in days gone by, so it will fail again unless we read the Bible thoroughly in our own native tongue. He alluded to young persons being ashamed to talk in our fathers' language; they prefer English, which they talk without understanding it properly; and that if the natives desire to be good Christians, free from sin, slavery, polygamy, idolatry, human sacrifices, and be good soldiers of Christ, and see Africa great and glorious, they should be taught the Bible at school and in the institutions in the native tongue, and extend it to their neighbours in the interior, so that when the European missionaries retired from the field we shall be able to preserve and keep it faithfully, and hand it down pure and freely to our future generations; that it will be a great sin and shame to us if we fail. He beseeched them to leave off a little of dress and other matters of minor importance, and support the British and Foreign Bible Society. Bishop Crowther told us of the power of the Gospel unto salvation, through the Word preached, and alluded to recent persecutions at Bonny by the masters against their slaves, because they would not work on Sundays, but go to church and pray. The great secret, however, was that the converted slaves would not offer or join to offer sacrifice to their idols or juju; and he had portions of the 115th Psalm read to them; also a portion of Ephesians (Chapter vi.).

Mr. Farler cannot be blamed for carrying the war into Dr. Lenz's own territory. Travellers are the favourites of the period; and in no career are the prizes more abundant and brilliant. All the world admires the traveller. The missionary, whom few admire, and certainly not the general public, may think it hard that a casual visitor, whom probably he has aided and befriended, should be listened to as if he were Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools when he informs Europe that African missionaries are worthy people who do a great deal of harm. An Englishman who exiles himself to Central Africa enjoys few of the compensations within the reach of the African traveller. He suffers a hundredfold the privations, and he has to wrestle with a barbarism which may be perverted into something worse by undigested education and proselytism. It would not have been surprising had an African missionary, who has resigned the advantages of civilization and attractive prospects in his own land, infused some bitterness into his retort to a rather too magisterial condemnation of his whole object in life. But the real question remains, whether the charge be true, whoever brings it. The opinion of most who examine the evidence will probably be that any large _dictum_ to the purport that missionary work in Central Africa is all illusory is a gross exaggeration. From unimpeachable testimony it is clear that missionary settlements in the country are bearing fruit, whether much or little. Negroes are actually redeemed from debasing sensuality, superstition, and indolence. There are missionary villages in Central Africa which would compare favourably with many English hamlets. The picture Mr. Farler draws of his own station is corroborated by a body of independent testimony, and it demonstrates the accomplishment of marvellous results in a dozen years. Attention there is fully paid to the primary duty of teaching the native the virtue of regular industry, which he had unlearnt through the excessive complaisance of nature. So long as the effort is sustained there can be little doubt that the beneficial effects will go on, and that the individuals subjected to this process will lapse no oftener than professing Christians in Europe and America.\n\nThere seems to be no ground for questioning the soundness of the influence of British Protestant Missions, so far as its scope extends. In Central Africa, as elsewhere, English missionaries are tempted to adopt too precisely English models and ideas, which require constant English supervision to be kept in working order.

The cause of this stagnation or decline, so contrary to what ought to be, is very easy of comprehension. The quantity of produce brought down from the interior depends entirely upon the purchasing and carrying capabilities of the monopolizing native traders at the oil ports. These purchasing and carrying capabilities are not increasing, nor is there any probability that they will increase under the institutions that now prevail. Bonny has made some little progress in civilization and Christianity: the king and some of the chiefs, or their sons, have received, more or less, education in the missionary schools of Sierra Leone and in England, but there seems good reason to doubt whether that education has developed in them those principles which alone can tend to raise the moral, social, and commercial reputation of their town and country. It is with reluctance and sorrow that we feel compelled to make this statement, because we had hoped for far better results. The missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, under the impulse and inspection of Bishop Crowther, are, we hope, progressing, but they are not a little impeded by the heathen prejudices, practices, and interference of some of the principal chiefs. At Calabar the Scotch Presbyterian missionaries have laboured zealously for many years, and with some effect; but, alas! how little compared with what might have been hoped from such devoted labours. The same may be said of the Cameroons River, where the Baptist missionaries have worked with ardent devotion for five-and-thirty years. They have given education to many, and made, we hope and believe, many sincere individual converts; but they have not obtained a dependable ameliorating influence as regards the abominable heathen customs and institutions of the country. The colony they have founded at Victoria, Ambas Bay (in the immediate neighbourhood of the Cameroons River, at the foot of the mountain), with their converts expelled from Fernando Po by the Spanish authorities, is, however, a bright spot of promise, from which a most salutary influence may yet spread to the interior. And this is all we have to record as the fruit of five-and-thirty years, effort by ardent Christian societies in England, and devoted labourers sent out by them to those countries south of Lagos. We say nothing of the River Niger, because there we have an opening to the interior. Our business just now is with the said Oil Rivers only; and we repeat, that the condition and prospects of civilization, Christianity, and commerce are the very reverse of satisfactory or encouraging, and this is the more afflicting, in view of the vigorous efforts making in so many other directions for removing the dark veil of ignorance and superstition with the paralyzing influences inseparable from heathenism. Our notice has been called to this matter of the Oil Rivers by letters from Old Calabar, which appeared in our June and September numbers, and again by some words in the account of the exploration journey from the Cameroons which we now publish. The letter in our June number seems to show that the heathen despots of Old Calabar have grown daring by impunity, and in defiance of the treaty regulations with Great Britain, are doing their utmost to extirpate the Christianity that has been planted among them. The writer sums up by saying: ""The persecution of the poor is grievous; there are no laws—nothing but arbitrary and arrogant dealings. The whole country is full of robbery. In consideration of the cruel treatment of Christians, and slaves who desired to become Christians, and who are crying for help, we think that Calabar ought to become an entry port."" To become an entry port, means to be placed under British jurisdiction. Mr. Greenfell, the Cameroons explorer, says, ""The head men in the river are anxious to be under Her Majesty\'s control. They are waiting only for King Bell\'s sanction and co-operation to petition the British Government to be included in the British Realm. They are getting tired of their attempts to govern themselves. Every dispute leads to war—and often to great loss of life."" And after enumerating evils, atrocities, and intimidations, he concludes, ""This state of affairs would be quite altered upon British occupation. Civilization would be at a premium then, and the people not afraid of mending their habits."" The only real and efficient remedy for the paralyzing evils that prevail, is thus pointed out, in both cases, to be British government. This agrees with the opinions we have for a long time expressed. We see no other hope for those places; and, alas! in view of the prevailing policy in England, this is the same as saying, ""There is no hope at all."" We dissent altogether from that policy, Lord Derby and his Liverpool speech notwithstanding. It is a modern, sceptical, bastard, un-English policy, unworthy of a great Christian nation—a direct repudiation of the sacred obligations that God has imposed on it by its prosperity. It is, however, not the less an effectual bar at present to all action in the direction indicated from Old Calabar and the Cameroons. The delusion is strong among the governing class in Great Britain. If permanent, it will prove to be a fatal one. The hand never stands still upon the dial-plate of nations; from the moment it ceases to advance, it recedes. But the delusion must pass away ere long. New and increasing sources of national wealth must be discovered and utilized, if the stupendous, conventional, social edifice in the British Islands is to be supported. That we have a famine to deal with in India, and that this and similar catastrophes, which it is, alas! only too reasonable for us to expect, may impose on us great national sacrifices, is so far from being a convincing argument against further British extension and vigorous world-development action, that it weighs, to our mind, heavily in the opposite scale; heavily in favour of bold and confident progress, instead of retrogression, or even apathy. We have touched upon this subject before, when urging our views as regards the development of the resources of the Gambia and Niger rivers; and we shall avail ourselves of every opportunity of enforcing what we believe to be a truth of vital importance to Great Britain and her people. The West Coast of Africa, including those now non-progressing Oil Rivers, is a vast mine of national wealth for Great Britain, if she will only seriously direct her energies to its civilization and development. One intelligent European succeeded in penetrating, some years ago, to the interior of one of those oil rivers, and his inference from all that he saw was that, if that river were under European control, the existing wretched monopoly put an end to, and free and secure access to the interior permitted and afforded, the produce of the interior brought down for shipment would, within a very short time, be quadrupled—with a corresponding increase, of course, of those manufactured goods and other commodities which the natives would desire to obtain. At scarcely any, if any, of these oil ports is it an aboriginal people that now bars, as described, the passage to the interior. They are the descendants of interior tribes, who, when the foreign slave trade was at its height, pressed down to the coast: marauders, plunderers, kidnappers, in the interior; slave-traders at the sea side, with barracoons and slave depôts filled with the wretched human beings destined for the plantations on the other side the Atlantic. Forced to abandon their slave-trade practices, they have since been useful in the early stages of the work of transition to legitimate commerce. But this does not confer on them any right or title to prevent the light of civilization from penetrating to that interior, from which they aforetime drew their supplies of slaves, and now their oil. There are now in all these communities some men of a certain degree of education and intelligence—advantages which many of them use to their own dishonour and disgrace, instead of to their honour and repute. The dominant persons at Old Calabar are, we believe, among this class. We recommend to their consideration the certainty that, although the present policy of Great Britain will prevent their being immediately deprived of the power they so vilely and dishonestly use, they will certainly not be permitted much longer to outrage both the letter and spirit of those stipulations with Great Britain, under which they are at present allowed to exercise authority. It is the ruling desire of the people of Great Britain that the light of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ shall have free course among the African populations. It is only by respecting and lending themselves to the furtherance of those desires, that the now tolerated authorities at the Oil River ports can entertain\n117', 'last_edit_date': '1877-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1877#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land.""

The textbook highlights the pivotal roles played by African converts, catechists, and ministers, particularly after 1914, with figures like Canon Apolo Kivebulaya and Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther leading missionary efforts and working beyond their ethnic groups. The emergence of separatist or independent churches, which integrated African beliefs and practices, further illustrates how Africans actively shaped their religious experiences. Mission-educated Africans became evangelists, teachers, and leaders, influencing both colonial and local affairs, while Afro-American missionaries and Afro-Christian churches underscored the active participation of Africans in the religious landscape. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the crucial role of native ministers, such as Mr. Bernasko, in facilitating missionary activities like Captain Burton's visit to Dahomey. The Wesleyan Missionary Society's reliance on native agents for evangelization, due to language and climate challenges faced by Europeans, highlights the importance of African involvement. The success of native converts as teachers and the efforts of leaders like the Right Rev. Samuel Adjai Crowther in the Niger Mission, including fundraising for church construction, demonstrate their significant influence in religious and colonial contexts.

These details align with the claim, demonstrating that local converts and African individuals played a crucial role in shaping Christianity in Africa and influencing broader socio-political contexts.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that Christian missions in Africa involved significant contributions from local converts and African individuals. For instance, the articles mention native ministers like Mr. Bernasko, who played a crucial role in facilitating Captain Burton's visit to Dahomey, highlighting the active participation of African individuals in missionary work. Additionally, the Wesleyan Missionary Society emphasizes the importance of employing native agents for evangelization, acknowledging the challenges faced by European missionaries due to language barriers and climate. The articles also mention the success of native converts as teachers and the desire to train more native African agents, indicating their significant role in shaping religious experiences. Furthermore, the Right Rev. Samuel Adjai Crowther, a native African, is noted for his leadership in the Niger Mission and his efforts to raise funds for building a new church, demonstrating his influence in both religious and colonial affairs.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley. The itinerant Liberian prophet, William Wade Harris, travelled through the Ivory Coast and the Apolonia District of the Gold Coast between 1910 and 1915 and converted some 100 000 people.

These churches were of two main types, namely, those which broke away from already existing independent churches and those which sprang up independently of any existing religious groups. In most instances, these churches sought to incorporate a larger measure of African beliefs and practices into Christian life than was permitted in churches under missionary control. They were an expression of the desire of Africans to find 'a place to feel at home', and include African ideas of worship in their Christian liturgies. An important causative factor was the translation of the Bible into many African languages and the Africans' reading and interpretation of the Christian Scripture. On the basis of their own under› standing of Holy Scripture, Africans formed or founded their own churches, thus doing away with the monopoly over scriptural interpretation which had been in missionary hands for so long.\nThe breakaway churches, in part, represented the African reaction or adaptation to colonialism and were emancipatory in character. Especially in areas of European settlement, where political repression was intense, such churches proliferated and attracted African nationalists. The Ethiopian churches in South Africa, which emphasize African selfimprovement and political rights, are a case in point. Nehemiah Tile broke away from the Methodist Mission Church in 1882 and two years later founded the Tembu Church,$^{34}$ one of the first independent churches ever to be formed in Africa. The second, which was the first to be called 'Ethiopian', was founded by a Wesleyan minister, Mangena M. Mokone, in 1892, again in South Africa.

For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

Around 1850 the missions, together with the traders and the political administration, became involved in an irreversible process leading to an early form of colonial rule. The appointment of consuls with expansionist views went hand in hand with armed blockades and the establishment of protectorates. The excuse given by international diplomacy was always that such actions were aimed at the radical and final suppression of the slave trade.

It has, therefore, given us great satisfaction to hear that there are now on the banks of the St. Paul\'s River alone 458 acres of land under sugar-cane cultivation, of which above 100 acres have been planted this year. The estimate of crop which has been sent to us from these plantations seems to be, however, very low; so low, that we think there must be some error, unless a larger portion of the cane than we are aware of is of too recent planting to give good crops this season. The produce is returned at 307 tons of sugar and 160 tons of molasses. The plantation of one of our correspondents alone has produced 100 tons. We should have been glad to see the cotton industry well established in Liberia; but as sugar planting has been preferred, and as both soil and climate are admirably adapted for the cane, we expect shortly to find Liberia among the great sugar-producing countries.

He was, however, rescued by a British ship, taken to Sierra Leone, and educated there by the Church Missionary Society. He was baptised in 1825, and was afterwards employed as a teacher, and in 1843, having been ordained priest, he was sent to his own country, Yoruba, to assist in the conversion of his people.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Livingstone Congo Inland Mission', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present moment, marking as it does an important era in the history of this Mission, occasioned by the transfer of its management from the hands of its founders—the East London Institute—to those of the American Baptist Missionary Union, is opportune for calling attention, even in the columns of a commercial journal, to the character of the work it has and is so nobly carrying on in the centre of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them.""

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses.

There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways.

The steady increase in the number of Muslims in Sierra Leone from 1891 to 1931 is illustrative of this fact. Thus, whereas in 1891 Muslims formed 10 per cent of the population, they formed 12, 14, 19.5 and 26.2 per cent respectively in 1901, 1911, 1921 and 1931. 17 The Muslim presence along the West African coast was also further increased by the Ahmadiyya Muslims who came as missionaries using the coastal sea routes.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

Human society was an unbroken family made up of the dead, the living and the yet unborn.\nWith regard to man's relation to society, being human meant belonging to a community and that involved participating in the beliefs, ceremonies, rituals and festivals ofthat community$^{2}$ and membership of the community was emphasized more than a member's individuality. For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife. An individual did not stay in one stage of existence for ever; he necessarily moved on to the next, and in order to make the transition smooth, special rites were performed to ensure that no breaks occurred, and movement and regeneration continued perpetually. 3\nAfrican traditional religion was not only pervasive, it also bound men to the unseen powers and helped them to form correct relations with the non-human powers; it also bound men to their fellow human beings.\nReligion acted as the cement which held societies together, providing them with support and stability. Furthermore, traditional religion helped men to understand and control events, to relieve doubt, anxiety and guilt."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""Unlike the Protestants, Roman Catholic missionary activities owed their stimulus during the same period to the vision and energies of one individual, Cardinal Lavigerie, who was appointed the Archbishop of Algiers in 1867.

Its aim was to work in 'Central Africa' as 'the religious counterpart of the African International Association, working within the same geographical limits, from ten degrees north to twenty degrees south of the Equator, and placing its stations within reach of those of the lay organization, so that mutual assistance could be rendered.'$^{55}$ The Society's first station in East Africa was established at Tabora in 1878. The Holy Ghost Fathers, who had preceded it ten years earlier at Bagamoyo, had concentrated on establishing colonies for freed slaves rather than expand› ing mission stations. Thus, by the time the White Fathers started invading the interior, the Holy Ghost Fathers had only gone as far as Morogoro where they established a station 'about a hundred miles inland at Mhonda'. 56 From Tabora a number of White Fathers went north to establish a station at Bukumbi on the southern shores of Lake Victoria and thence to Buganda. When they arrived at King Mutesa's court they found that the CMS missionary, Alexander M. Mackay, had preceded them by several months and that the Muslims 'had been in the country for several years, and a number of the Chiefs had accepted the faith'.$^{57}$ This was the beginning of religious rivalry between the Muslims and Christians on the one hand, and between Protestants and Catholics on the other. Mutesa was able to control these rivalries by balancing one group against the other, but, after his death in 1884, the rivalries were to influence greatly what was happening at the court."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': 'Missionary work, during the period under discussion, was in its pion› eering phase. On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 521, 'article_title': 'General Observations', 'full_section_title': 'General Observations', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-12', 'issue_date': '23_01_1865', 'content': 'There can be no better proof that education and trade are making way on the West Coast of Africa than is furnished by the Report of the Postmaster-General for 1864.

The first and foremost, because in it are involved many others, is that his policy should now be a policy of peace and goodwill, such as will, by the maintenance of pacific relations with all around, tend to the development and increase of the commerce of Lagos. It is thus only that such a revenue can be obtained as Lagos requires for the prosecution of those sanitary and other works of civilization, in which we must do him the justice to say he was not lax when previously in authority as Acting Governor. But to effect this it is not alone necessary to obtain a revenue. There ought also to be a strict economy in every department, the abolition of all offices not indispensable to the public service, and the filling of all offices, as far as possible, with educated Africans. It is only by the latter that the Africans can be educated for self-government, as recommended by the Committee of the House of Commons of 1864; and it is only by economising the revenue in the matter of official salaries, of police (which has been on far too large and costly a scale), and of general unproductive expenditure, that money can be found for making Lagos a place in which Europeans may reside with comparative safety to health, for giving her the nucleus of those institutions which ought everywhere to mark the presence of Christian civilised rule, and for making the island a pattern and example to the natives of the interior who will be drawn thither by an increasing trade.

I send with them a clear statement of our purpose, and especially of those circumstances which are making us feel the need of sympathy, help, and encouragement from our brethren in the Mother Church. In venturing to trouble you with a few facts, I am acting as the spokesman of all those principal Church members who assembled at Kissy Road Church, on June 2, to bid our brethren God speed; and I trust the following statement may meet the eye of many friends of Africa.\n\n(1.) This is the scene of the earliest work of the Church Missionary Society. It was led up to by striking providences. It has been costly in human life as well as in money. Not less than half a million, I believe, has been spent here. The outward and visible result is a compact Native Church of some fifteen parishes, not including the cathedral, with a native pastor, parsonage, church and school in each parish.\n\n(2.) This Church, though mainly self-supporting, is still receiving £300 per annum from the C.M.S., which is now being withdrawn at the rate of £50 per annum. We raised last year, for instance, for the Pastorate, _amongst ourselves_, £1,169 18s. 3d class pence alone producing £937 14s. 11d. This is about the average.\n\n(3.) We are a missionary Church. The C.M.S. handed over its missions to the Native Church in 1875. Our Society is called the Sierra Leone Church Missionary Society. We have two missions in the Bullom and in the Quiah country. We have two ordained missionaries with catechists under them. They cost us about £400 per annum. These missions are not making much progress; we scarcely maintain the _status quo_. We can only be said to affirm the principle of the thing. All this thickly populated region, from the far interior to our very border, is practically unevangelized.\n\n(4.) Sierra Leone is only important, financially, as a depot for trade. The Peninsula, though mountainous and fair-looking, is unproductive. A good understanding with the tribes in the interior is all that is wanted to make the Colony prosperous. We have a fine harbour, and are accessible to England, but the place by itself will neither support a Church nor even a Government. And thus I come to the ground of our plea for sympathy and help. Our importance as a Church is that we may be a depot for the interior and around. Heathen and Mahomedans trade with us, settle amongst us, and crowd our streets every day. Nothing is being done for them. Their influence on us is not for good. We are engaged in hand-to-hand intercourse, but not hand-to-hand conflict with their superstitions and sins. The result is enfeebling. We are awakening to feel our need of more spiritual power.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

It is only ten years since this interesting little island was under native rule, and a sort of British protection, which had been afforded with the object of entirely suppressing the slave trade that was still a devastating agent in neighbouring countries. It was found, however, to be impossible to prevent this altogether, while the island should continue under native rule; some little slave trade was still secretly carried on with the native mainland; and as the actual ruler of the country was only so by reason of the efficacious protection afforded by a resident British agent, with British ships of war within call, it was wisely and humanely determined by the British Government, in which the power and influence of Lord Palmerston were then supreme, that the native King should retire upon a pension, and the settlement be made a British one. We were an ardent promoter of this change, and incurred great odium in consequence, among merchants who, under British protection, there carried on a successful trade without payment of the duties exacted where British authorities held sway; and among educated African traders, who but in too many cases abandoned in Lagos those restraints which Christian civilisation imposed on them in Sierra Leone. Lagos was then a filthy, pestiferous place, peculiarly fatal to Europeans. Ten years, only ten years, and what a change has been accomplished! At no other place in Africa has civilising progress been so rapid, or shown such irrepressible energy. Mistakes were made in the early days of British rule, which led for a time to an entire alienation of the powerful Egba nations on the mainland; eventuating in hostilities that for some time paralysed trade, and left bitter seeds of distrust in the native mind in Abeokuta and elsewhere. By a wiser policy, however, during the last four or five years, Administrator Glover has done much to redeem the past in that respect; abstaining from everything that could give rise to further distrust or suspicion. We are sorry sometimes to think that he never can obtain the confidence and goodwill of the Egba people; and that, in consequence, many works that would shed additional lustre upon his name, can never be effected by him. And here we think it well to take advantage of this opportunity to impress upon him the necessity, in the interests of Lagos, of not incautiously recommencing efforts such as for opening communication with Ibadan, &c., they may arouse anew the old hostile feelings, and that can only serve to retard the realisation of those useful objects which he no doubt has in view, but which we are persuaded the interior natives never can be brought to assent to and co-operate in, until Lagos shall possess an elected Legislative Council. When this right shall be accorded to her, the presence and influence of those educated African merchants and traders, civilised and Christian, which Lagos already has in no small number among her citizens, may and will enable the then Government of Lagos to overcome all suspicion and animosity, and to show Egbas, Ijebus, Ijeshas, and all concerned, that Lagos desires the introduction of such and such works among them, not from motives of ambition or lust of dominion, but for the mutual and reciprocal advancement of Lagos and the interior. That elected Legislative Council cannot be long denied to Lagos. Her progress is too rapid to permit of this. Her revenues, from duties on imports, are now, we believe, between 40,000l. and 50,000l. a-year. They will, no doubt, yearly increase. She has well-laid-out streets, presenting a striking contrast to the former agglomeration of the vilest class of African huts. Those streets are lighted. Sanitary improvements have made her a healthy place of residence, even for Europeans, if they will abstain from the indulgence of those destructive propensities which may be justly said to have dug by far the greater number of British graves along the West Coast. And having churches and chapels, which have been for the most part built by funds raised in Lagos itself, she is now making an effort for a church tower, with its public clock. We admire this public spirit among her educated African traders; and this particular manifestation of it has our warmest sympathy. We do not offer pecuniary aid; nor do we ask any one in England, unless he be a Lagos man absent for a time from his country, to give any aid. We are jealous for the reputation of Lagos. She is able now to do such works for her embellishment and convenience with her own money, and she will do it; and if the list of contributors be furnished to us when the necessary sum shall be all subscribed, we will immortalise them in our columns. Meanwhile we wish them heartily Godspeed; and we desire that those sincere friends of Africa who do exist in England, should take comfort in seeing what God has already wrought by the civilising and Christianising agencies of Great Britain, in a place where but a few years since the waters were daily defiled by the poor murdered victims of the brutal and abominable slave trade.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1871#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN IN THE WEST INDIES', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Bishop made a good voyage to Jamaica, and arrived at Kingston on July 5.

Important resolutions were passed undertaking to carry out the ideas of trustees in London, and so, on requisition being made either by the Bishop of Sierra Leone or the Church Missionary Society, the Mico college is prepared at its own expense, to train, say, four men annually for educational work in Western Africa. We cannot adequately express our sense of the great importance of this definite stage now reached in our inquiry; and we say without fear of contradiction to those who have it in their power to use African teachers in West Africa, that they may confidently trust the directors, the staff, and the excellent influences, both spiritual and moral, brought to bear upon the students of this excellent College.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

In his letter he tells us of some things we had not before heard. Mr Ussher seems by his report to have been in great pain shortly preceding his death, for the letter says, “He was heard, hard by the Castle, growling from the effects of his disease, and at death he was buried in a plain-dressed (unfurnished) coffin, and had the ill-fortune to be interred without the reading of the burial service.” Now this, if true, is, we think, a just cause of deep reproach to the other officials at Accra. What! could not one of them exert himself to obtain the assistance of a missionary, or himself read the beautiful service appointed by the Established Protestant Church? We could scarcely have believed it possible for British officials, under any circumstances, thus to fail in the last token of respect for a late chief, whom but a few hours before they may have been ready too obsequiously to serve. Our correspondent does not say that there is any necessary connection with the above and his letter, but it seems to us that there was a connection in his mind between the two statements. He says, “To this may be added that during his lifetime he was often seen on Sundays with his rifle over his shoulder going hunting or sporting, in utter disregard of the duties of the Sabbath.” Although, perhaps, there are not other high officials of the British Government on the West Coast who would thus show the “utter disregard” thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher, we have thought it well to print these observations that they may see how such conduct, when it does occur, is noted and commented upon by the Africans, who have been educated in the Missionary Schools, and who are taught to look upon the British as a Christian Government, and upon British Government officials as representing in Africa a British community one of the great characteristics of which is an abstention on the first day of the week from all ordinary secular amusements and employments, except where circumstances may make the latter absolutely necessary. And we cannot refrain from expressing our deep regret that any British Government officials on the West Coast should set such an example as is thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher. As representing such a community as that of Great Britain, we certainly think it their duty to “affect a virtue even though they have it not.” It is true we cannot charge the British Government with having done much to promote education among the West African people, and therefore cannot accuse them of imparting a mere secular education which in Africa, we are quite sure, would produce most baneful effects, as affording a people whom it is proposed to release from the sway of the most debasing, degrading superstitions, increased means for the perpetration of evil, without bringing them under the really civilizing restraint of those higher principles of human action which the blessed doctrines and precepts of Christianity inculcate for the guidance of responsible human beings in their intercourse with each other. But we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, the propriety (as it seems, if what this correspondent reports be true, there is a necessity) of laying it down as a rule for Government officials in the British settlements on the West Coast that they shall not by their conduct neutralize the teaching of the Protestant missionaries, to whom the African people are indebted for all the education they have received. What we desire for Africa, and what ought to be at least desired for her by the British Government, is not only that she shall advance in civilization, but that the civilization in which she advances shall be a Christian one; and we do not think we ask too much of a Secretary of State for the Colonies in asking him to lay down such rules as we have above mentioned for the conduct of British officials holding appointments under the Crown in West Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

However, it does not specifically mention the crowning of a Christian king in Cape Coast, indicating a gap in addressing this particular historical event. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed accounts of the crowning of King Haggerty II, a Christian and educated leader, as a pivotal moment in local power dynamics and cultural transformation. The articles emphasize the king's departure from traditional practices, such as human sacrifices, and his commitment to Christianity, marking a significant cultural shift on the Gold Coast. They also highlight the broader missionary efforts and European influence in promoting Christianity and civilization, aligning with the theme of Western cultural impact. However, the articles also reveal tensions in power dynamics, such as disputes with the British Governor, illustrating the complexities of reconciling traditional and colonial authorities.

Lands hitherto reserved for gods and goblins were released either for arable use or for the siting of social institutions like the school, hospital and so on. The younger generations went to school where they learned new techniques which equipped them for employment in government, commercial firms or missions.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'The forces which played the leading part in changing the social structure and character of colonial Africa are easily catalogued. They were the very fact of colonial conquest with its attendant political settlement, western education, western Christianity, western economic forces and increased urbanization. Details of how most of these forces - especially those of military conquest, political conquest, consolidation and economic exploita› tion - penetrated Africa and gained a firm grip on her society have been given in other chapters of this volume. It remains to do the same briefly for urbanization and western education before passing on to an analysis of the social effects which all the forces working jointly produced.\nIn dealing with urbanization it is necessary to emphasize that this important force of change was not introduced into Africa by European rule. On the contrary it had been operating there - with all the opportunities it offered for occupational specialization, population aggregation, social mobility and so on - for centuries before the imposition of European colonialism. The coasts of North, East, West and Southern Africa, as well, for example, as inland areas such as the Sudanic belt and Yorubaland were all centres of ancient and continuing urban aggregation thanks to the catalytic impact of political consolidation and international trade. But it is undeniable that European rule gave urbanization in Africa a new impetus by strengthening those political and economic forces already working in that direction. The result was the rise of new urban centres in places, such as Igbo and Ibibio lands of Nigeria, which had not previously experienced urbanization, as well as the expansion of the old centres. This it did largely by creating improved means of communication, new political and administrative headquarters as well as new centres of trade, mineral and agricultural exploitation. In this regard it is noteworthy that between 1850 and 1950, for the continent the critical century of European contact and foreign rule, the annual growth rate of urban population of Africa was 3.9 per cent compared to the world average of 2.6 per cent. This throws much light on the growth rate of urbanization generally in colonial Africa. The new outburst of urban development and expansion invariably meant an increase in its catalytic role in social change.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literary culture in the Western Sudan', 'content': ""a crowded audience in the assembly hall of the Breadfruit Church in Lagos, stressing the incompatibility of European ecclesiasticism with the society and traditions of the African.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Islam in the pre-colonial period', 'content': 'In spite of the advances Islam had made before the arrival of the colonial powers, the last decades of the nineteenth century witnessed the destruction of some of the theocratic states in West Africa and the weakening of Islamic trade and economic influence in East Africa.

Before his election the royal stool had been for rather a long time vacant. The kingship of Cape Coast—of a town under the very walls of Cape Coast Castle, and within which town (from the time when an influx of troops took place at the Castle during the Ashantee War) the Governor and other civil authorities have been actually residing—was looked upon as a matter of so little consequence, that some of the best English friends of the Gold Coast have been of opinion that no such person ought to be recognised. But the new King seems to have taken his dignity and position and power seriously—to have looked upon them as facts to be asserted, and not mere myths. He has appointed magistrates, one of whom bears the title of Chief Magistrate, and taken other measures for making his rule effective. A conflict of authority was necessarily one of the earliest results. One of the King's magistrates having by artful means got a clerk of a British subject, and said to be himself a British subject, though his family are natives of Cape Coast, within his clutches, refuses to allow him to make a journey on which his master had sent him, and on his disputing the authority which detained him, and asserting his right to leave, orders him to be thrown violently to the ground by some half-dozen of his myrmidons, and there severely flogged. His master, on the facts coming to his knowledge, complained to the Governor, who, as in duty bound, immediately interfered. The King of Cape Coast, however, came forward and took upon himself the responsibility of what had occurred. Communications take place between Governor and King, and the former considers himself treated with so much insolence, that he counsels and authorises the bringing a civil action for damages against the King's magistrate, who had committed the offence. This order of civil action, instead of criminal proceedings, was in itself weakness; but the Governor is reported to have promised that he would insist on the payment of any damages that might be awarded. We cannot enter at length into all the details of interviews between the Governor and his counsellors and the King, in which his Excellency's efforts failed so much, that the Governor, before the King left, informed him, in the name of Her Majesty, that he could no longer recognise him as the King of Cape Coast, and very properly, that he would not allow him to have prisons in Cape Coast Town.\n\nThe court gave damages and costs against the King's magistrate, who had refused to appear.""}]","[{'document_title': 'The First Native Christian King of Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Governor, who was suffering from the effects of a recent severe indisposition, then rose and made a short speech. After which the Rev. Mr. Sykes, of Abeokuta, gave a very interesting account of the attack of Abeokuta by the Dahomans early in 1863. The Rev. Mr. Sharp next related his experiences at Porto Novo. A mission had been established two or three years since in that hotbed of slavery and the slave-trade; and it appears the effort has been crowned with singular success. After one or two other speeches, the King stood up and took a step or two in advance of his seat, and to the great delight and surprise of the assembled multitude, addressed them in his native tongue, although he reads and writes and speaks English perfectly well. He said: ""It hath pleased the Lord, in the depths of His inscrutable wisdom, to call me this day to be your ruler; but my greatest glory is finding myself this night in your midst as one of yourselves—a Christian. It is now nearly twenty years ago since my late Royal father died. I was then excluded from the succession by the chiefs, because, and only because, I preferred to serve the true God; rather than make oblations to the Fetishes of my forefathers. I was a marked man, and accused of being an enemy to my country, because I took no delight in sacrifices; but the Spirit of the Lord upheld me through all my troubles, as I will now relate to you. Many, many years ago, long before any Christian minister had ever visited these parts (the missions were established in 1832), myself and my two late companions, the late Joseph de Graft and the late John Sam, used to assemble at one another\'s houses occasionally and dip into the mysteries of the blessed Bible. My father, the late King, had permitted me to visit during my youth the then very imperfect colonial school, more with the view of satisfying my childish caprice than in the hope of my picking up any useful information. The little I learnt there I greatly, very greatly improved by help of my two friends. Myself and my two friends got regularly into the practice of having Scripture readings and prayers at our houses; and first one friend, then another, and another joined, until at last we began to have a goodly muster every time we met. Some of the chiefs and Fetish priests began to be alarmed at our proceedings, as subversive of all order and their time-honoured institutions, and took us before the Governor of those days, who cast us into prison. We were then enjoined to return to the Fetish worship of our fathers; and when we refused, we were publicly flogged at the castle gate. There are hundreds of persons still living who were witnesses of the indignity put upon us. After being confined some time, and scourged again and again, we were cast out of prison, as utterly unworthy the further solicitude of the chiefs and Fetishmen for our future welfare; and they said they must leave it with the Fetishes themselves to deal with us after our deserts. About the time we were released from prison a Bristol trading vessel arrived at Cape Coast; the master, one Captain Potter, had been trading a long time on the Coast, and was well known. We visited this good Bristolian at the house he stayed at, and requested an interview with him. We related all our troubles and trials to him, and the punishments we had undergone, and desired the good captain to assist us with his friendly advice.

He said he had a friend in Bristol, a minister of that persuasion, and he felt no doubt but that he could get the letter forwarded to London, and that our petition would be favourably considered by the managing committee. The letter was written and signed by all three of us, and handed over to Captain Potter. Some few short years elapsed, and then we saw the result of our petition to the Society in London in the advent of a missionary, **the first that had ever visited these parts;** and now, this night, we behold the mighty glory of the Lord, His power and majesty, and His overflowing love, in the sight which now presents itself to us.

The attention of the whole civilized world is being directed to Africa, with its immense and yet untouched resources; and we shall be forced to do more than merely keep the police of the seas on her coasts, for the protection of cannibalism and the foulest superstitions, because we have a commercial gain to derive from them. The state of those so-called Oil Rivers has long been weighing heavily on our heart, because it has become so evident that mere commercial intercourse with them, will do little or nothing towards the emancipation of their people from the beastly and loathsome superstitions and habits, to which they have become enslaved. That emancipation must take place, sooner or later, by the strong arm of European power. Commerce alone will not effect it; missionary teaching alone, without a basis of civilized power to rest upon, will not effect it. The former opens the way; and the latter performs the work appointed by God, that the Gospel shall be preached as a witness to the nations; but the strong arm of civilized power can alone cope with the Satanic action exhibited in those insults and outrages to humanity which we have mentioned. As a general rule, the heathen Africans will receive the material benefits which commerce brings with it, and the presents which missionaries bring in their hands, but remain untouched in their debasing superstitions and their instincts. While they could indulge their foul practices, as it were, in a corner, so that the revelation of them to the Christian civilized communities of Europe came only at wide intervals and in a very shadowy form, we might ignore them, and believe that it was no affair of ours to interfere with them.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""CHRISTMAS-DAY AND NEW YEAR'S DAY."", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that will have closed before this paper can reach the hands of our African readers has been one marked by great and important events in Europe, which, as the chief field of Christian profession, may naturally be expected to undergo startling and terrible visitations as the world draws nearer and nearer to that end to which we have pointed. Among the political events we are inclined to regard that which has cast down thrones in Germany, and seems to be culminating in a new German Empire, as chief in menace and in promise. It has roused strong animosities, and may lead to new combinations of powers for working out those changes which are coming upon the earth. We have no prophetic spirit—we do not profess to know what even a day or an hour may bring forth; but we feel, and we hope that all our friends both in Europe and in Africa will feel with us, that these are times in which we cannot be too zealous in the performance of those works which have been given us to do. We know that our work is to bring all the forces that we can command to bear for promoting and furthering the Christian civilization of Africa. And if this duty is ours, how much more evidently is it that of every educated African. There is no hope for Africa but in that civilization, as there is scarcely an educated African anywhere who does not owe the education he has received directly or indirectly to Christian effort on behalf of him and of his race. The governing authorities would have left him everywhere in the thraldom of ignorance and degrading superstition, even when freeing him from absolute bodily slavery to his fellow-man; but various Christian organizations have, in obedience to the Divine command, come forward in his behalf and to his rescue, with results which are scoffed at and derided only by those who would have used his race for ever as victims of their interests, and of all those evil passions by the indulgence of which they who are not Christ\'s work out the devil\'s work on earth. This very fact, even supposing no love of Christ in his heart, no religious feeling to have been generated in or brought home to him with the knowledge he has received, ought not only strongly to impress every educated African with a sense of duty, but to show him clearly and unmistakably in what direction his path of duty lies. In striving to advance his own individual earthly interests, whether in science, trade, commerce, agriculture, or manufacture, let him keep constantly in view that all he has received by which he has been made to differ from the most filthy and degraded of the savages of his race, is the fruit of advancing Christian civilization, and of that alone; and keeping this in view he will not, and cannot, fail in combining with exertions for his own personal advantage and aggrandisement, equally constant and strenuous efforts for the spread of that same civilization on the continent and in the islands which he inhabits. European Christians have begun the work among the Africans, and they will not abandon it; those to whom we now write are the first-fruits of that work; but to spread widely abroad among their race the Christian civilization which has been to them individually as the breath of life, raising them up to stand before the world as fellow-men, and vindicate their claim to the equal possession with others of every land and hue of those mental endowments which divide, as by a line of eternal fire, man from the brute—to spread widely abroad this Christian civilization among their fellow Africans, is the task manifestly allotted to Africans. It is on this ground, among others, that we advocated and enforced in our last the assuming by the community of Sierra Leone of the expense of that educational work among them hitherto at the charge of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, that the funds now thus appropriated by those societies may be set free for commencing similar work in other West African districts. And it is on this ground also that we are so anxiously endeavouring to stimulate them to the production and demand among the natives of new articles for commerce. All civilization must have material resources upon which it may feed, by which it may be supported and strengthened. Christian civilization, and bodily filth and misery as the characteristics of the whole mass of the people, cannot co-exist. As the former progresses, the arts of civilization and the ameliorations of civilized existence must go with it; and these cannot go with it unless the earth is made to ""yield her increase"" by the application to it of a certain organized industry, which it will never receive except under the impulse of a trading demand. The natural riches of Western Africa are enormous, and are such as will sooner or later support a commerce to which that at present existing on the Coast is merely fractional; but for this the means must be employed by those whom God is manifestly raising up for the work. And lastly, it is on this ground that we call upon all the European employés of the British Crown in Africa to use the means and power of their position for helping on the educated Africans in that propaganda of civilization of which we have been treating. The Parliamentary Committee of 1865 has declared in favour of the preparation of Africans for self-government; and whatever may have been the opinions previously entertained by governors and others in authority on the Coast, from that moment it has become additionally their duty to bring the educated Africans into consultation and into participation in power, as regards the revenues to be raised among them, and the mode in which and the objects for which those revenues shall be spent.

Never yet has the future of Africa been so full of hope and light. Here, too, there is a north and a south struggling—not for supremacy over each other, but for the regeneration of a continent. In Algeria the French are fast displacing the torpid vestiges of Moorish sway, and are transforming a fertile and healthful country into a lesser France. Where the Moslem, for five centuries, forbade Christian foot to land—where, under the cold shade of the crescent, man has so long wrapt the earth in lethargy—not far from where heathenism crouched under Carthaginian ramparts—on the very spot where a power that imperilled Europe and conquered Spain, held rule thereafter—a prosperous Christian community, great in every element of strength, is now established. Within twenty years this French colony has so grown and prospered, that it is now the home of 200,000 Europeans, consumes seven millions sterling of imports, and ships three millions sterling in the form of exports, such as corn, tobacco, cattle, fruit, oil, and minerals. That the French influence in Algeria is for good, cannot we think be disputed. From the coast to the confines of the Sahara that vigorous and vivacious people are imparting to North Africa quite a different character, and are literally making the wilderness blossom like the rose. But a yet more interesting work goes on in Egypt. Capital is flowing there from Western Europe in marvellous measure. Vast have been the benefits and the material wealth secured to Egypt by the fact of its being the highway to the East, they are as nothing compared with the blessings that are about to be conferred on it by the interposition of foreign influence, and the growing discernment and wider knowledge of those who rule Egypt. Possessed of a soil of perennial richness, calling for little culture, and naturally irrigated, the valley of the Nile, which is as prolific now as it was in Pharaoh's time, is already yielding largely in cotton and corn. Tenacious though the people may be of old customs and traditions, much of their dogged Orientalism is breaking down before the resistless forces of the age—the constant friction caused by the ever-flowing stream of western life that permeates Egypt. We say nothing of the gigantic canal scheme, which, whether it fails or succeeds—and in the interests of our common progress we hope for the latter—has enriched Egypt by the expenditure in it of millions of money. The extraordinary extension of cotton culture there—the rapid covering of the soil by a most valuable crop—the establishment of mills and factories for the better manipulation of local products—the commencement of steam traffic down the Nile, and the probability that before long a railway traversing the valley where as yet the shades of Thebes, of Karnak, and of Abou Simbel have had the desert in all its grim silence to themselves—will penetrate into Abyssinia, not only draining of their natural wealth those lower districts, but tapping the yet more varied fields that lie beyond—these are but some of the onward symptoms that are making Egypt a great power for good, and that will exercise a most beneficent pressure upon the savage kingdoms of the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND HER EVANGELIZATION', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A friend of Africa would naturally be guided by the practical result of the religious and other means adopted for her elevation in the social scale, and her enjoyment of those advantages which Christianity alone possesses.

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around.

With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

What they have found bears little resemblance either to the \'fanatical witch-doctors\' of colonial reports, or to \'the magic of despair\'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that \'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for ""primary resistances"" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.\' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. \'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine\'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the \'high priestess\' was dismissed and executed. \'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.\' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west. Some› times it happened because of the influence of Christian ideas - and Hendrik Wittboi drew upon Protestant Christianity for his doctrine of sovereignty, while an African independent Christian prophet was active among the Nama at the time of their rising against the Germans.

Resistance called for mobilization, and in many regions religious leadership arose to fulfil this role. The era of primary resistance was also the era of the prophets. While the Africans lost the actual wars in the battlefield, the mood of resistance remained entrenched in the hearts of the many. The followers of the Orkoiyot in Nandi remained active and watchful and the Nandi were repeatedly mobilized by this prophetic leadership to resist the abuses of colonialism over the years.$^{4}$ Similarly colonial archives from Kenya are full of references to witch doctors and laibons creating trouble in Marakwet, Kericho and Samburu. In western Uganda the followers of the Nyabingi cult in Kigezi were being watched all through these years. Thus these traditional religious resistance movements provided an element of continuity with the former era. But as the first decade wore on into the second, colonialism appeared to be gaining in strength; to many, indeed, it appeared as if the worst of the evils had come to earth. The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system.

The Esza people of Abakaliki Division, the Uzuakoli and the Aro may be cited as examples.$^{6}$ Some cults were clearly a focus for resistance to colonial rule, such as the Mwari in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), or secret associations like the Poro in Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa. War-charm movements also occurred in Madagascar and the Congo basin. In East Africa, especially Kenya, African prophets arose to provide spiritual reinvigoration$^{7}$ to resist colonialism, such as occurred in the Machakos District among the people of Kilungu in the early months of 1922 (see Chapter 26). One of the best-known movements which used both religion and magic to resist colonial rule and oppression was the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa during the first decade of the twen› tieth century.$^{8}$ (See Fig. 7.1.) Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities. Besides, the movement provided the seed for African nationalism which was later to germinate and blossom into the struggle for independ› ence and its final achievement in the 1960s.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government. In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them. But in both cases, the colonial system finally diminished their authority."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.737, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The role of religious ideas', 'content': ""Thus colonial writers spoke of a 'witch' as leading the Giriama rising in the coastal hinterland of Kenya; more recent historians have reinterpreted her as a 'prophetess'. But Cynthia Brantley Smith, in her admirable and exhaustive account of the Giriama, establishes that she was no sort of religious leader: merely a respected and assertive woman.$^{28}$ This is a case in which a retranslation of colonialist terms like 'witch' and 'witch-doctor' is not enough to correct the distortion of official accounts. It has been suggested by two researchers on Ndebele and Shona history that the same is true of my own account of the 1896 risings in Southern Rhodesia; the British South Africa Company said the risings were fomented by 'witch› doctors'; I argued that they were powered by a profound prophetic ideology; Julian Cobbing and David Beach assert that the spirit mediums were of much more restricted influence than I allowed and that the priests of Mwari participated in the risings hardly at all.$^{29}$ It will perhaps not be found surprising that I am unready for such drastic revisions. But it certainly is true that recent work on African religion in Southern Rhodesia shows that its relationship to resistance cannot have been so straightforward as I had supposed. It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained. Today, African art, music and dance are not only taught in educational institutions of all kinds but are now in boom in Africa and gaining recognition in Europe.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Essentially a spirit, God had no images or physical representations and was acknowledged as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. Power, justice, beneficence and eternity were attributed to Him, and as the Source of all Power, God had power over life and death. He rewarded men but also punished them when they went wrong and was in many ways likened to the Overlord of Society and was the Final Authority in all matters. On the whole, God was unlike human beings and was completely above His creation, but at the same time, He was involved in the affairs of men, sustaining creation and upholding the moral order. Human beings depended upon Him as a Power superior to them. God was therefore transcendent as well as immanent.\nThere was a hierarchy of spirits. Below God were the ancestral spirits, which were always treated with reverence and with awe, and then there were also the deities or gods who were believed to have the power of rewarding human beings or punishing them with misfortune, disease or even death.

The former, as we have seen, was the fostering of a sense of identity and consciousness among the various classes or ethnic groups inhabiting each of the new states, or, as in the French West African colonies, a cluster of them; while the latter was a sense of identity of black men the world over. The vehicles for the articulation of the former were, as B. O. Oloruntimehin has shown above (Chapter 22), various movements, political parties, youth leagues and associations, religious sects and newspapers, while those of the latter were the various Pan-African Congresses discussed by R. D. Ralston above (Chapter 29). But important as this legacy was, it is a typical example of the accidental by-products rather than deliberate creations of the colonial presence. No colonial ruler ever set out to create and nurture African nationalism.\nBut if there were positive effects, even greater were the negative ones. In the first place, important as the development of nationalism was, not only was it an accidental by-product, but it was not the result of a positive feeling of identity with or commitment or loyalty to the new nation-state, but a negative one generated by a sense of anger, frustration and humiliation caused by some of the oppressive, discriminatory, humiliating and exploi› tative measures introduced by the colonial rulers.

He prayed for the Governor, and those in authority under him; and when he mentioned the King, who was kneeling at the right hand of the Governor, a slight tremor in the voice and the subdued tone told how the feelings of holy joy and gratitude had overcome the eloquence of the tongue.

While we admire the generosity which awakened this regret, we can rejoice that in the administration of Him who is exalted a Prince and a Saviour not a moment is lost to mercy.\n\nLet me assure you that opinion is gaining ground in Europe that all future success in the work of christianising the heathen and Mohammedans in Africa depends on a judicious development of native agency. The work of christianising Africa can never be accomplished by foreigners; there is the language, climate, and strength against him. Nor can he think and feel as they do. He may speak to them lovingly and tenderly as only lips moved by a heart burning with compassion can speak, but it is yet the voice of a stranger.\n\nThe Native Church, thus planted and supporting itself, is determined by the help of God to conquer the evil of this place, to resist the assaults of Satan, to win souls unto Christ, and to become a grand centre of evangelisation and civilisation to the interior countries. All natives therefore must know that in this great work we are all fellow-labourers, and cannot free ourselves from its responsibilities. It is not confined to the missionaries and pastors alone; it is all, both lay and clerical.\n\nOur duty, my dear friends and countrymen, is a solemn one, for religious privileges involve also religious duties. Let us aid the pastors in every possible way, and give for the promotion of God's glory and the well-being of our fellow creatures.

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Bishop of Sierra Leone on the Education of the West African', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Christianity which Bishop Ingham longs to propagate in the Black Continent is a system of conduct; it must manifest itself in practical utilities, and not in barren propositions.

The interesting communications that we have lately inserted, made by persons but too deeply concerned in the Educational department of the colony, on which, with that of religious teaching—the Native Pastorate—the earliest discomforts of the position seem to have fallen, in strict accordance with the old official principles of government in the colony, appeal too strongly to our well-known sympathies and convictions to allow of our doing so. We have received so many letters during the last few months, in which the writers give most saddening pictures of the moral state and condition of the colony, which our personal experience of a too prevalent dishonesty only too fully confirms, that we look upon the curtailment of education and of public religious teaching with the most serious alarm for the future of the colony and for the reputation of Sierra Leoneans everywhere down the Coast. We are quite aware that the old enemies of the African people will point to those conditions of individual mind and practice which our correspondents stigmatize, and of which we complain, and say, ""Education and religious teaching, forsooth! behold the fruits of them; we have had too much of them already. Some of the greatest cheats are men who have more than any other a redundancy of Scripture phrases at the tip of their tongue."" But they are grossly mistaken. Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people. But that retrenchment, on which we feel thus bound to insist, ought never to have touched the School Department or the Native Pastorate. This is indeed beginning at the wrong end.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years. We do not want to see a white teacher back in Buganda till we have converted the whole people to the Mohammedan faith.""\n\nThere is a lesson to be learnt from this case, and what has lately happened to the German East African Company in Zanzibar. In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

Such men will, we are sure, secure the confidence and respect of the native clergy. The native Church and the colony are not so far advanced in education and intelligence as to be independent of foreign aid.

In his letter he tells us of some things we had not before heard. Mr Ussher seems by his report to have been in great pain shortly preceding his death, for the letter says, “He was heard, hard by the Castle, growling from the effects of his disease, and at death he was buried in a plain-dressed (unfurnished) coffin, and had the ill-fortune to be interred without the reading of the burial service.” Now this, if true, is, we think, a just cause of deep reproach to the other officials at Accra. What! could not one of them exert himself to obtain the assistance of a missionary, or himself read the beautiful service appointed by the Established Protestant Church? We could scarcely have believed it possible for British officials, under any circumstances, thus to fail in the last token of respect for a late chief, whom but a few hours before they may have been ready too obsequiously to serve. Our correspondent does not say that there is any necessary connection with the above and his letter, but it seems to us that there was a connection in his mind between the two statements. He says, “To this may be added that during his lifetime he was often seen on Sundays with his rifle over his shoulder going hunting or sporting, in utter disregard of the duties of the Sabbath.” Although, perhaps, there are not other high officials of the British Government on the West Coast who would thus show the “utter disregard” thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher, we have thought it well to print these observations that they may see how such conduct, when it does occur, is noted and commented upon by the Africans, who have been educated in the Missionary Schools, and who are taught to look upon the British as a Christian Government, and upon British Government officials as representing in Africa a British community one of the great characteristics of which is an abstention on the first day of the week from all ordinary secular amusements and employments, except where circumstances may make the latter absolutely necessary. And we cannot refrain from expressing our deep regret that any British Government officials on the West Coast should set such an example as is thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher. As representing such a community as that of Great Britain, we certainly think it their duty to “affect a virtue even though they have it not.” It is true we cannot charge the British Government with having done much to promote education among the West African people, and therefore cannot accuse them of imparting a mere secular education which in Africa, we are quite sure, would produce most baneful effects, as affording a people whom it is proposed to release from the sway of the most debasing, degrading superstitions, increased means for the perpetration of evil, without bringing them under the really civilizing restraint of those higher principles of human action which the blessed doctrines and precepts of Christianity inculcate for the guidance of responsible human beings in their intercourse with each other. But we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, the propriety (as it seems, if what this correspondent reports be true, there is a necessity) of laying it down as a rule for Government officials in the British settlements on the West Coast that they shall not by their conduct neutralize the teaching of the Protestant missionaries, to whom the African people are indebted for all the education they have received. What we desire for Africa, and what ought to be at least desired for her by the British Government, is not only that she shall advance in civilization, but that the civilization in which she advances shall be a Christian one; and we do not think we ask too much of a Secretary of State for the Colonies in asking him to lay down such rules as we have above mentioned for the conduct of British officials holding appointments under the Crown in West Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

It was evident that the recent choice of her Majesty's Government had been judicious, as Major M'Callum's experience in Asia had been somewhat similar to that which would await him in Lagos.

His East Indian experience showed him that there were no opponents more obstinate as to sanitary reform than the Natives themselves, and that it was necessary to carry such reforms vi et armis.
