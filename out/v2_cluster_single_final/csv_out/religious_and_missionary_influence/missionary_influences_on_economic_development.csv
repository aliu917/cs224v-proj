The General History of Africa highlights that missionaries were not solely focused on building churches and converting Africans but also on promoting agriculture, establishing experimental farms, and teaching skills such as masonry, carpentry, and tailoring. They set up schools and colleges, which played a crucial role in spreading Western education and literacy, and contributed to the introduction of a money economy by developing plantations and promoting commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, and cotton. Missionaries were also instrumental in infrastructure development, such as roads and railways, which facilitated economic activities and minimized regionalism. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the role of missionaries in teaching the value of labor alongside the Gospel, with examples like the Baptist Missionary Society's report from the Cameroons and the Basle missionaries' efforts in road construction and agricultural promotion in the Gold Coast. The articles also discuss the integration of commerce and Christianity, with European merchants and missionaries working together to promote legitimate trade and economic development. However, both sources acknowledge the complex and often exploitative nature of these contributions, noting that missionary activities were closely linked to colonialism, sometimes weakening traditional African societies and hindering genuine progress through negative influences like the gin trade and superficial Christianity. Overall, the observations from both sources align with the claim by showcasing the multifaceted role of missionaries in Africa, combining spiritual and practical efforts to foster economic growth and European influence.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that missionary activities in Africa combined spiritual outreach with practical contributions to expand European influence and foster economic growth.

As European nations increasingly became interested in the acquisition of African territories, the missionaries paved the way in some areas of Africa and served, quite consciously, as agents for European colonialism. Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': 'Missionary work, during the period under discussion, was in its pion› eering phase. On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': 'In Southern Africa, even greater attention was paid to education than in other parts of Africa, thanks partly to the grants-in-aid that were given by the governments of the Cape and Natal during the period. It would appear that the educational activities of the missionaries had been far more successful than their evangelical activities by 1870.$^{18}$ Not only had many elementary or village schools been established but, from as early as the 1840s, teacher-training and secondary institutions were founded. The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Evangelical Christianity', 'content': ""Evangelical Christianity, in whose eyes the Origin of Species was damnable heresy, had no qualms, nevertheless, in accepting its racial implications.

But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible. The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

In the main, evangelization took the form of American black missionaries working, first, in the service of mainstream, predominantly white denominations. For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education. (Not only were some of the 'white church' evangelists black, but some white mission› aries were placed in Afro-American schools to prepare for African service.)

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'The greatest social impact of the missionary revolution, however, was the emergence of an educated elite in Africa.

There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone.

On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""One of the factors that enabled the Maghrib to maintain for so long this ambiguous relationship with the capitalist world-economy (half in, half out) was the large role the trans-Saharan trade played in North Africa's economic life.

The cutters will be capable of carrying a gun and ammunition in addition to their ordinary crew, and will possess buoyancy sufficient to prevent the hull of the boat, with its gun, ammunition, and crew, from sinking in the event of its being struck by shot, or stove from any other cause.\n\n**IMPORTANCE OF INDUSTRIAL AGENCY IN AFRICAN REGENERATION.**—How strongly this is shown in the following extract from a Report to the Baptist Missionary Society, dated ""Cameroons"":—\n\nThe circumstances of these people require that they should be taught the value of labour as well as the Gospel. I do not wish to undervalue pulpit duties and good preaching, but a man that could do no more would be but a sorry workman on the West Coast of Africa. The working man who has the love of Christ in his heart, and can preach Christ in all plainness and simplicity, is the man that will find work to do for many years to come.\n\nThe last remark is full of important truth, and will go far to explain to our readers the manifold employments which fill the missionaries\' time. It must not be forgotten that on this coast there are none of the advantages of civilisation. All trade is barter; and it is only by gifts of cloth, tobacco, and the like, that the missionaries can secure the fruits of the earth for food. If they want a house, they must build it. They must be both workmen and instructors of workmen. In other lands the missionary can have all his wants supplied, if he only possesses money to purchase what he needs. In Africa, he must be his own purveyor, his own carpenter and brickmaker, and money is of no use. Thus he depends on stores from England, and on the exchanges he can effect with the natives, for his daily food. Inevitably his day is occupied with manifold secular employments, as well as with exertions for his great object—the evangelization of the people. Here the Gospel is accompanied by the arts of civilised life, and the missionary must be the pioneer of both.'}, {'id': 340, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '04-11-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_05_1864', 'content': '\n\nI have often thought of giving you a short notice on this most important subject, which lies necessarily at the very root of African improvement, and consequent civilization.

In the Transvaal and in the Free State they deal with the natives on the patriarchal principle. In the Free State, for instance, every Boer has five natives, that is to say, five families attached to his farm, and these five natives are not allowed to leave the farm to which they are bound. A similar rule prevails in the Transvaal. In some parts of the Transvaal the land is let on the métayer system, that is to say, the natives take the land from the farmer and pay him half the profit, and some of the natives, among whom this system prevailed, appeared to me to be among the finest and most prosperous in South Africa. Throughout the whole of South Africa the morals of the natives are very shady. I found everywhere a recognition of the superiority of what are called \'mission natives\'—that is to say, natives among whom missionaries have established their agencies. They grow more corn, do more trade, and generally consume much more British manufactured goods than Kaffirs, among whom missions have not yet been extended. The Transvaal State is largely a misnomer. In the Transvaal there is no State in the sense of an organic whole obeying the orders of a Central Government. There is the semblance of a State, but decentralization and individualism are carried to such extent that the orders of the Central Government are set at naught whenever the local Landrost and his neighbours prefer to disobey them. This it is that renders it so very difficult to deal with the Transvaal, which is but a loose confederation of a great number of farmers scattered over an immense territory, each of whom does first that which is good in his eyes, and obeys the Government or not as it pleases him.""\n\n**THE MATABELE.**\n\n""Right to the north of Bechuanaland lies the most fertile territory in South Africa, Matabele-land.

Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Human interest, resting in Europe upon the strong fulcrum of human wants, is the mighty lever that God has clearly ordained for lifting the great continent of Africa to the position she has been endowed for. She has passed rapidly, though it may seem to have been slowly, through the earlier stages of her elevation. The epoch of more potent effort has now arrived. Combined mercantile energy enters the rich field where legitimate individual enterprise has been preparing the way for it. Just as powerful European organizations prosecuted the slave-trade in Africa which individual cupidity desultorily commenced, and thus gave to that accursed traffic the enormous development to which it attained, so will powerful European organizations now take the field in giving development to that legitimate commerce for which Africa possesses so many rich and copious elements. A century and a-half ago English African companies were erecting their fortified slave factories along the Western Coast of Africa. Now English African companies are holding out their peaceful hands to the African people, to tempt them onward in the path of agricultural industry. There are large fields for legitimate commercial action in Africa, and large profits to be obtained there, if they be honestly, actively, and intelligently sought by organizations of practical experienced men, with such sufficient capital as shall enable them to plant firmly where they trade, the standard of their peaceful industrial array. Companies with too restricted capital can only do the same sort of work that individual merchants have been and are performing. This was and is useful enough for Africa, and beneficial to the merchant, as far as it can prudently go. But Africa now wants more than this. She wants powerful companies, that shall prudently but boldly stimulate and assist her to a much higher and more extensive industrial development.

To distant people, we form one of the most intelligent and civilized portions of Africa, who, although not under a European Government, are enjoying as much of their influence as if we were born civilized. But to have a proper knowledge of the cotton tree, it is necessary to approach it more closely, when it will be discovered that it is full of thorns. This is the only way I can contrast what our country is with what it is considered to be. Our country is, undoubtedly, a great port for the palm-oil trade; and it appears to me that the only influence existing is that of raking and draining it of every speck of oil that could be got—and nothing more. Sordid avarice and insatiable gain is their only and chief aim. We own that we are poor, ignorant, heathen people, and, perhaps, vile savages too, as we are often styled; but we cannot feel more happy than when we have Europeans among us, whose goodness we feel proud to copy and imitate. I do not think that the days of contraband, when man formed the chief article of trade among us, were worse than ours—the period when lawful commerce takes the lead, and the Christian religion regulates its progress. Trade, from the way it is carried on, has a rather debasing effect on us; religion, from the stingy manner it is introduced and its principles engrafted, tends to steep us in a twofold ignorance, almost as dark as that in which it found us; so that the only improvement resulting from the advantage both of commerce and religion among us, at present, is a low cunning and a doggish reverence. People whose ears are accustomed to hear the fair carol of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in our country through European influence and missionary efforts, might be constrained to denounce my observations as a slander: but if they know the truly meaning of multum in parvo, and how it is unscrupulously practised by their agents abroad, I need not labour to convince them. I do not ignore the fact that faithful workers have from time to time been sent to our country, and that, through them, we should have been better; but the thing is this, those already in the field informed them, ""When you go to Rome, do what Rome does."" The merchant, whose only ambition is to hoard up all he could rake from the negro\'s hide, grins with pleasure and satisfaction at his wretchedness, contrives new methods of aggravating humanity, and uses all his subtle skill in advocating, if possible, the total extinction of the vague, glimmering twilight that shines around us; and the missionary, as a rule, teaches the black man hardly anything beyond the Bible, transcribed in his own tongue. In one of their conferences, held at Gaboon, the missionaries have decided not to give us and our children any intellectual training. We keenly feel the result of such selfishness, not only for ourselves, but for our children and children\'s children. How painful it is to think that there is not a single youth in our country who is capable of being more than a menial servant in any of the European establishments here! Why is it so different at Bonny, at New Calabar, at Brass, and throughout the Niger territory? It is thirty-six years ago now since a mission was planted in our midst; yet we do not present a brighter aspect than that of a dilapidated and neglected plantation. There is nothing of civilizing industry introduced into the country whereby to profit our youths; whereas in the Niger Mission—which is working exclusively by native agency, headed by its Bishop, and a grand train of clerical and lay assistants—industrial training is incorporated with the work. To every mission-station in the Niger is appended a first-class boarding-school, the pupils of which are fit to teach the teachers whom the Mission here laboured so arduously to produce. The Niger is able to furnish herself with a good staff of able and competent artisans, interpreters, clerks, and teachers; and is getting up a theological institution to train their own men.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared.

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction. More commonly, the competition for captive labour generated intense hostility among and within trading factions.

In several instances, they overstepped their authority and enslaved their own subjects or neighbours in order to main› tain the flow of wealth and weapons upon which their power rested. The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades. Fifty years later the Gwemba, Nsenga and Tawara rose up against their mestizo (Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Asian) and Chikunda overlords who had been enslaving them and exporting them to the coast.$^{48}$ } '' The Shona-dominated region, stretching from the southern margins of the Zambezi to the Inhambane hinterland, becariie a secondary source of slaves, as did the Delagoa Bay area to the south.

The Lozi aristocracy and landlords also used slaves to dig canals and ditches in order to bring fertile marshy soil into cultivation. By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position. To the extent that slaves acquired as corvØe labourers tended to become chattel, the nature of slavery often changed from earlier forms which emphasized the reproductive role and the use of slaves primarily to expand the size of the kinship network. accompanied the raids and the expansionist activities of the slave-traders. Fields were ravished, entire villages destroyed and survivors often com› pelled to flee their homelands and resettle in inaccessible, unproductive locations. One nineteenth-century traveller recalled the effect of the Yao raids in the 1860s against the Manganja: A number of the Manganja went with them. Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony.

Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time.

The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'With the effective end of the Atlantic slave trade and the increased demand for gold, palm oil, palm kernels and peanuts from western Africa, sugar cane from Mauritius, RØunion and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean, as well as ivory and cloves from East and Central Africa, there was an increased demand for captives not only to produce these goods, but also to transport them by headload or by canoes down to the coast. Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'.

After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C.

If the missionary comes to teach or preach, he is welcome, the Association will assist him to the utmost. If a man comes to travel, the land is before him; let him travel, observe, shoot, go where he will; the country is free for him as if he owned it. If a man comes to settle, he will have advice, assistance, and protection; but there is no room for political intrigue, nor further occasion for it. We have been building a State, and it behoved us to fence it round with all measures calculated to insure its being undisturbed in its period of infancy and weakness.

To distant people, we form one of the most intelligent and civilized portions of Africa, who, although not under a European Government, are enjoying as much of their influence as if we were born civilized. But to have a proper knowledge of the cotton tree, it is necessary to approach it more closely, when it will be discovered that it is full of thorns. This is the only way I can contrast what our country is with what it is considered to be. Our country is, undoubtedly, a great port for the palm-oil trade; and it appears to me that the only influence existing is that of raking and draining it of every speck of oil that could be got—and nothing more. Sordid avarice and insatiable gain is their only and chief aim. We own that we are poor, ignorant, heathen people, and, perhaps, vile savages too, as we are often styled; but we cannot feel more happy than when we have Europeans among us, whose goodness we feel proud to copy and imitate. I do not think that the days of contraband, when man formed the chief article of trade among us, were worse than ours—the period when lawful commerce takes the lead, and the Christian religion regulates its progress. Trade, from the way it is carried on, has a rather debasing effect on us; religion, from the stingy manner it is introduced and its principles engrafted, tends to steep us in a twofold ignorance, almost as dark as that in which it found us; so that the only improvement resulting from the advantage both of commerce and religion among us, at present, is a low cunning and a doggish reverence. People whose ears are accustomed to hear the fair carol of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in our country through European influence and missionary efforts, might be constrained to denounce my observations as a slander: but if they know the truly meaning of multum in parvo, and how it is unscrupulously practised by their agents abroad, I need not labour to convince them. I do not ignore the fact that faithful workers have from time to time been sent to our country, and that, through them, we should have been better; but the thing is this, those already in the field informed them, ""When you go to Rome, do what Rome does."" The merchant, whose only ambition is to hoard up all he could rake from the negro\'s hide, grins with pleasure and satisfaction at his wretchedness, contrives new methods of aggravating humanity, and uses all his subtle skill in advocating, if possible, the total extinction of the vague, glimmering twilight that shines around us; and the missionary, as a rule, teaches the black man hardly anything beyond the Bible, transcribed in his own tongue. In one of their conferences, held at Gaboon, the missionaries have decided not to give us and our children any intellectual training. We keenly feel the result of such selfishness, not only for ourselves, but for our children and children\'s children. How painful it is to think that there is not a single youth in our country who is capable of being more than a menial servant in any of the European establishments here! Why is it so different at Bonny, at New Calabar, at Brass, and throughout the Niger territory? It is thirty-six years ago now since a mission was planted in our midst; yet we do not present a brighter aspect than that of a dilapidated and neglected plantation. There is nothing of civilizing industry introduced into the country whereby to profit our youths; whereas in the Niger Mission—which is working exclusively by native agency, headed by its Bishop, and a grand train of clerical and lay assistants—industrial training is incorporated with the work. To every mission-station in the Niger is appended a first-class boarding-school, the pupils of which are fit to teach the teachers whom the Mission here laboured so arduously to produce. The Niger is able to furnish herself with a good staff of able and competent artisans, interpreters, clerks, and teachers; and is getting up a theological institution to train their own men. But here no such things are studied, although I am sure of their meeting the ready approval of our benefactors in Britain.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1884#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

Over large areas drink is almost the sole currency, and in many parts the year\'s wages of the negro factory worker are paid altogether in spirits.\n\nWe read with shame and alarm the wanton acts of misgovernment, which are of periodical, if not constant, occurrence on the West Coast of Africa, from the Gambia down to the mouth of the Niger and the Oil Rivers District. The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

They made such a plausible tale that I was quite taken with them, and forwarded a box of gold dust, together with samples of goods I wanted in return. This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me. But I hope my experience will be of some use to others who, trading on the West Coast of Africa, are under the necessity of trusting so much to persons or firms in London or the other European capitals.—Yours faithfully,', 'last_edit_date': '1891-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1891#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL DEPRESSION ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The most unpleasant side of the question to me is that, after these inexperienced European merchants have so imprudently supplied goods to adventurous traders without securities, or worthless securities (and many a time without any reference to the Coast respecting the pecuniary status or reputation of the consignee), they are only too ready to brand all Africans as a race of dishonest robbers. A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings. Often upon the receipts of large credits new modes of living are at once adopted; artificial wants rapidly increase; the luxuries, the expensive, and perhaps not innocuous pleasures of European life, and the extravagance of foreign fashions, become at once indispensable; large houses are built and furnished, perhaps in very expensive style. . . .

In English settlements or trading ports the Englishman\'s predominate; and along the south or Slave Coast Portuguese or Spaniards predominate. There is one Government official here who has a prominent Government situation (got by some freak of fortune), who has been lately married; that man actually received another officer\'s mistress (he being tired of her, or not wishing to have such encumbrance longer with him). Well, this prominent official had this young person living with him as openly as possible for upwards of two years, if not more; at last he took it into his head to marry (whether through love or for pecuniary reasons is a question), so he fabricated all sorts of falsehoods, and, being rather ""hard up,"" got a lot of money from the girl\'s friends through her influence, besides a quantity of gold trinkets, went to England, and returned to Africa and married a young lady who is by far too good for him. The poor deserted girl has been and applied several times to him for the money he borrowed of her, but he has cleverly shuffled her until she was obliged to give the matter up.

There is absolutely not a single place, where the natives are left to their own free-will, in which there is the slightest evidence of a desire for better things.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes.""

The statement of these men is somewhat alarming, and presents a new feature in the history of plunder and brutal treatment to persons which from time to time are reported to us as taking place on that river. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How Commerce Alone Civilizes', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trade in palm oil in the Brass river is very considerable.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Slaves obtained their freedom, thus forcing those who formerly depended on slave labour to do their own work for themselves or shift to dependence on wage labour. Lands hitherto reserved for gods and goblins were released either for arable use or for the siting of social institutions like the school, hospital and so on. The younger generations went to school where they learned new techniques which equipped them for employment in government, commercial firms or missions. And since these jobs were available for the most part in urban areas, it means that conversion to Christianity could also imply a predisposi› tion to live in urban areas. Or to take another example, a man could go to the urban area in search of economic advancement while being still staunchly loyal to the traditional religion.

In the first group are those organizations which could be described as purely 'social', that is devoted to promoting conviviality and relaxation. These were made necessary by the absence from the towns of the traditional forms of amusement, relaxation and citizenship training - such as the masquerades, age-grade associations and traditional festivities. There was also the attraction of forms of modern European social life as advertised in the life of the European community in each colony. In this category were the football clubs, Scout and Girl Guide movements, debating societies and alumni associations.\nIn the second group are the ethnic unions. These were an extension of rural ethnicity to the urban areas. There were different hierarchies of them - village, clan and ethnic unions. These had two main functions. One was to help the individual who had migrated newly to the town to adjust as smoothly as possible to the conditions of urban life. Thus when a migrant first reached the town, he usually made his first contacts with members of his village or clan union who would help to find him accommodation, to introduce him to employers of labour or master craftsmen to teach him modern skills. They also taught him how to comport himself in the city. Through such associations members got help when in difficulty. They could get loans to continue their business if they sustained crippling losses. Funeral, marriage and other expenses approved by the association could also be met with loans or donations from the group as the case may be. ' ° The other function of the ethnic unions was 'to provide a channel for progressive public opinion at home', especially through maintaining an organized link between the sons at home and the sons abroad. To do this they had to take an interest in the political and social development of their homes. At first this won the associations the opposition and obstruction of suspicious colonial officials. In south-eastern Nigeria, for instance, where by the 1930s the colonial power was still toiling to entrench the idea of native authorities, the formation of these unions caused uneasiness in official circles.

Here we have in mind the rise of new organizations which helped to mediate the adjustment of many individuals and their rural homes to the new demands and norms of colonial society. These new organizations have generally been described as 'voluntary' by social scientists. They are 'voluntary' in the sense that people are not born into them as they are born into lineages, villages or ethnic groups. But closer analysis would show that for some of them, especially the ethnic-based welfare or improvement associations, membership is not that voluntary since the practical alternative to member› ship is generally ostracism of a kind.\nAfricanists are agreed on the social conditions which brought these organizations into being. It has been found that they generally originated in the urban centres, although some of them - like the ethnic-based ones - in time established home branches. The fact was that, as Professor Wallerstein has aptly put it, migration from 'the traditional rural to the modern urban area' led to 'dislocation and disorientation for the indivi› dual'.$^{8}$ Since neither the traditional society nor the colonial administration had the means to step in and meet the new needs of such migrants, they had to evolve their own institutions, systems and norms for achieving meaningful existence in the strange and heady social world of the town.\nThe studies of Godfrey Wilson in East Africa have shown that there was a clear correlation between the pressure of colonial society and the formation of these organizations. Thus Kenyan Africans, whose traditional culture came under unusually severe pressure from colonial rule and settler aggressiveness, had stronger and much more numerous ethnic associations than Africans in neighbouring territories like Tanganyika and Uganda. There was thus an element of individual self-protection and selfstabilization in the formation of the associations. Furthermore, urban conditions of existence created opportunities that made it relatively easy to form such organizations since, as Thomas Hodgkin has put it, it provided 'physical centres ... where men and women, with particular interests in common, can collide with one another'. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.595, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': 'Missionary work, during the period under discussion, was in its pion› eering phase. On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.588, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""Social organizations which contributed to the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics included the several branches in Africa of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association which had been founded in America in 1917.

Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization.

Before the hour of seven had arrived, the edifice was densely crowded, the admission being by free ticket. The chair, which was to have been occupied by Miss Alice Harris, Medical Doctor, and President of the Women\'s Christian Temperance Union, was taken by Mrs. Kezia Leah Cole, wife of the Rev. C. W. Cole of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Liberia, but a native of Freetown. This meeting was the first of its kind in the Colony. There was a hymn paper printed for the occasion, and perfect order and decorum prevailed throughout the meeting. Among the officers present, besides the acting chairman, were Mrs. Selina G. Robbin, the Archdeacon\'s wife; Mrs. Marian Mousa, wife of the Rev. S. Mousa, of St. John\'s Episcopal Church; Mrs. Rebecca Frederick, wife of the Rev. J. Frederick, of the A. M. E. Church; Mrs. C. D. Leigh, wife of the Rev. W. J. Leigh of the United Methodist Free Church; and also the Revs. E. Liversuch and H. W. Johnstone, and Mr. J. C. Thomas. When the company were all seated, the chairman arose, and announced the opening of the meeting by singing, ""The Temperance Ball is rolling on,"" which was followed by prayer by Mrs. Frederick; song by the Union, ""Fall into line, soldiers, fall into line;"" reading of Psalm cxlvii. by Mrs. Robbin. Then followed the chairman\'s address: ""Dear Christian friends, ladies and gentlemen,—The occasion that brought us here to-night is an important one. It is much to be regretted that the lady president, Miss Harris, who had intended to address you is, I am sorry to say, at home, prostrated with fever, for which reason I am here standing before you in her place; I would rather that the present business of this night were imposed upon some one abler than myself, as I did try to waive it yesterday when I was sent for by the said lady, not having rested my mind previously on any subject for this occasion, and not knowing that such unmerited honour, combined with great responsibility, was resting on my shoulders until the afternoon of yesterday. I trust, therefore, that I shall have the sympathy of this meeting. Our society is the Women\'s Christian Temperance Union; by the word Temperance, many people have understood the meaning to be moderation in all things, but the scriptural term in which our Union is understood is total abstinence; we need only refer to few Scripture passages to confirm the assertion. We notice this in 1 Cor. ix. 25; 1 Timothy iii. 2; Acts xxvi. 25; Romans xii. 3; and it is elsewhere rendered with closer adherence to its original signification—\'in his right mind,\' or \'sound mind,\' \'soberminded,\' \'discreet\' (Mark v. 15; 2 Timothy i. 7; Titus ii. 5, 6). These references will at once show that the temperance and sobriety inculcated in Scripture do not imply the ordinary use of intoxicating liquor, and that we have on the ground of verbal criticism as good right to apply these terms to abstinence as an objector has to set them up in opposition to it. Now, the object of our Christian Temperance Union is to restore peace, comfort, and happiness to the home which intemperance has shorn of its beauty, happiness, peace, and comfort; reason to those who have been deprived by its pestilence; and health to those who have been made feeble by its temptation; to make good citizens, good wives, and good husbands; pious and sober ministers of the Gospel in the place of those who are otherwise; sober and reliable members of the Christian Church in the place of false ones. This is our object and nothing more; we seek not worldly honour or reward, but following with a glad mind, and with an eye single to God\'s glory, the injunction of our Saviour—\'When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\' This we intend to do not in theory, but in practise; and for this noble work we determined never to give up our hold, but to persevere faithfully unto our life\'s end, while we extend our cordial invitation to as many as are willing to unite with us, and in the language of one of old \'Come thou with us, and we will do thee good, for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.\'', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.587, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Temperance Movement on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nAnamaboe, November 13, 1864.\n\nSir,—The third anniversary meeting of the Temperance Society was held here on September 15, 1864, at the Wesleyan Chapel, as usual.

The influx of Mohammedans into the Gold Coast has been very noticeable in recent years. In Accra alone, irrespective of the Hausa constabulary, there are probably not less than 1,000 followers of Islam.\n\n**Education.**—The educational system is based upon an ordinance passed in 1887 for ""the promotion and assistance of education in the Gold Coast Colony"" and upon rules framed by a Board of Education.\n\nAlthough there are two well filled Government schools, one at Accra and the other at Cape Coast, the work of educating the natives is practically in the hands of the Wesleyan and the Basel missionary societies. In 1892 the former had 26 schools with 2,948 children on the registers, and the latter 32 schools with 2,192 children. The Roman Catholics now have nine schools with 1,189 children on the registers. The total number of children under instruction in the Colony during the last five years has been as follows: 1888, 4,585; 1889, 5,038; 1890, 5,356; 1891, 6,688; 1892, 7,572.\n\nAlthough these figures show advance, the result is very meagre having regard to the population. As a matter of fact only five per 1,000 of the population are now attending the elementary schools, and there remains therefore an enormous amount of work to be accomplished.\n\n**Imports and Exports.**—Of the total imports about two-thirds come from the United Kingdom, the remainder being supplied by the United States, Germany, France, and Holland. The total value of the imports during the last six years is shown as follows: 1887, £363,715; 1888, £432,112; 1889, £440,868; 1890, £562,102; 1891, £665,781; 1892, £597,094.\n\nThe value of the exports during the last six years is shown as follows: 1887, £372,446; 1888, £381,619; 1889, £415,926; 1890, £601,348; 1891, £684,304; 1892, £665,064.\n\nBy far the larger quantity of the exports go to the United Kingdom; next in order are Germany, France, and the United States.

The transport of the timber from the timber grants to the coast is at present the principal obstacle to the success of the trade.\n\nOne of the most remarkable exports is that of monkey skins. During the last five years an average of 175,000 monkey skins, valued at about £30,000, have been exported annually.\n\nThe total value of the exports per head of the population was in 1892, 8s. 10½d.\n\n**Shipping.**—Under this heading the Report gives full particulars of (a) The number of sailing ships and steamers which have entered and cleared during the past five years; (b) The countries from which they have entered; and (c) the countries for which they have cleared during the same period.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1894#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.58, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GAMBIA CLUBS ORDINANCE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The third paragraph of the memorial states, ""That these societies have been standing uninterrupted for several years, and have been the means of producing good effects on the conduct of most of their outlawed and troublesome members, &c."" The right honourable gentleman and yourself may not fully comprehend the meaning of this important point in the memorial, and be led to inquire what are the good effects which have been produced by those societies. I will explain. Between 1837 and 1841 the sitting magistrates at the Gambia were wearied with one complaint and one plea throughout the rainy seasons, when business is half closed, and no employment can be found for the lower class of workmen, such as labourers, &c. These men must live, and when they could not obtain their living honestly, they procured it by dishonesty, going about stealing from the merchants\' stores, &c., and when taken before the magistrates they pleaded not guilty, giving as their poor, groundless reason, ""that they were in want, and, having nothing to live upon, as there was no work to do in the rains, and no merchant willing to give them credit, they were obliged to rob."" The magistrates then saw the real wants of the people, and consulted a Wesleyan missionary (now in England) to see if he could manage some means of restraining those lawless characters. The rev. gentleman then called on one of his local brethren to see what could be done. They concluded to form a ""Workmen\'s Club"" for assisting each other throughout the rains. The local brother mustered the whole of his tribe and explained to them in their own language the shame and disgrace some had brought on themselves, &c. He then showed them the necessity for a Workmen\'s Club, for assisting each other in time of need. The proposal was unanimously voted; and thus the first Eboe society started in the year 1842. It consisted of both males and females, and up to this day a male member pays 1s., and a female 6d. per month. At the close of every meeting the members were warned to be honest, and informed that should they require any necessary assistance the club will be ready to meet their wants. In the course of two years the practices complained of were totally forgotten. People became honest and respectful, other tribes following their example, until all the various tribes in the Gambia formed themselves into similar societies with similar objects. It succeeded so well that the magistrates and merchants returned their thanks to the rev. gentleman for his kind suggestion to the people. The people are also, to this day, grateful to him and to his local brother, their own countryman, whose son is now in London, sent by his countrymen to study for their further welfare.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-12-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1865#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.579, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CHRISTIANITY AND THE OTHER RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are only two Government schools in the settlement—one being at Cape Coast, and the other at Accra—each of which is unworthy of the name of a model school, although there are many English-speaking youths of educated parents along the many regular seaport towns and decently populated inland countries; of water tanks, only two—the one at Elmina, and the other at Accra—to which the public sometimes have access for a pot of water per family daily.

As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony. It is signifi› cant that except in North Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar, these languages have remained the official languages even to this very day.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Christianity served a similar purpose, providing a cultural framework for creating a Creole society out of disparate groups of peoples settled in Freetown and surrounding villages, as in various settlements on the Liberian coast, or in Libreville, Freretown, and other freed slave settlements. In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': 'In broad pan-Africanist terms, however, the evidence seems clear that African political and ideological visions were expanded and technical expertise was improved because of colonial African interactions with American blacks. The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora. This latter vision seemed not so much to discard as simply to vindicate and to reorientate to an African perspective the idealism implied in the earlier vision.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Introduction', 'content': 'The djihäd movements of Islamic reformation covered the whole of the Sudanic zone of West Africa, and the eastern Sahara up to Cyrenaica, and spread south to the borders of the forest region as their impact reached Senegambia and the Voltaic regions, the southern Mandinka, northern Yoruba and the Edo-speaking peoples. As the European demand for palm oil, peanuts, ivory, sisal and rubber grew and the internal network of long› distance trade routes responded to these demands, trade became a major factor affecting access to firearms and the acquisition of wealth, and hence the rise and fall of states over wide areas of Africa. As a consequence of this expanding European trade and the activities of European and American missionaries, Christianity and European ideas of social and political organ› ization also became factors of change over a wide area stretching from Sierra Leone to Southern Africa and Madagascar.\nWhat stands out most prominently in these different movements is the efforts of various African leaders in the nineteenth century in different parts of the continent to reform their societies. Some of the efforts were inspired by the heritage of cultures in Africa, others by reformist ideas in Islam. In most cases, the leaders were only too ready to take advantage of opportunities offered by the expanding scope of trade and the activities of Europeans, whether traders or missionaries, hunters of game or hunters of concessions. Another feature that stands out just as prominently was how these efforts of African leaders to reform were systematically being undermined by the very activities of European traders, missionaries and hunters that African leaders tried to exploit.\nIt is remarkable how little attention so far has been paid to this feature of the nineteenth century: of internal efforts at reform systematically being aborted by external intervention. Because of the assumption that colonialism and integration into the world economy were necessary con› ditions of modernization, most historians have failed to notice how much the nineteenth century represented an African effort at self-development and to what extent European conquest and colonialism was a subversion of that effort.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': 'Like Blyden, but unlike Samuel Ajayi Crowther, James Johnson advo› cated \'Africa for the Africans\', while he also popularized the concept of Ethiopianism in his sermons and writings.$^{49}$ Unlike his contemporary Crowther, he also passionately believed in and advocated the evangelization of Africa by Africans and vigorously and vehemently condemned the doctrine of black racial inferiority then being advocated.

From the earliest days of the process of presenting Christianity to Africans, some converts had accepted the new faith lock, stock, and barrel. Others, on the other hand, accepted it on the basis of what they already knew, and understood Christianity in terms of the basic underlying concepts of African traditional religion, relating the message of the Church to their enduring religious needs.\nThus Christianity did not come merely to supplant traditional religious beliefs and practices, rather it came to supplement them. In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious. This is why we have termed it indigenous Christianity.\nUnderlying indigenous Christianity is an expression of religious crea› tivity and cultural integrity, and not a mere reaction, response or adaptation to outside stimuli, as some scholars are wont to assert. Usually, and with a few exceptions, the explanation for the emergence and proliferation of movements of indigenous Christianity has been derived from factors outside these movements themselves which has given them a functional reasonableness or a dysfunctional aberrant quality. Such interpretations may not be devoid of validity but they tend to overstress the role of outside factors in the emergence of these movements.

But, alas! it seems that with it, as with the possessed maniac whose healing by our Blessed Saviour is recorded in the Scriptures of Divine Truth, Satan will, ere he relinquish his mighty hold (as he will ultimately be compelled to do), first rend and tear it, and make it an object for compassion and pity. His hold over the African countries for ages upon ages past has been an enfeebling and a ruinous one. But the finger of God is now manifestly stretched forth over them, and the glorious work of their deliverance and emancipation will be accomplished. We had great hope at one time from the labours of the Church Missionary Society in Abeokuta, which, under the direction, as we believe, of unerring and infinite Wisdom, it had chosen for the centre of its operations against the kingdom of the Evil One in the Egba countries; and although, as might have been expected, there has been a check in its onward course of success as a divine agent in freeing the victim from the hand of the spoiler, it has, nevertheless, sown the seed from which the harvest of power will one day appear. As shown by the letter of a Lagos correspondent in this our September number, the only small successful effort made by the Egbas during the late Dahoman invasion, was by a Christian war chief with his few Christian soldiers, which had the effect of precipitating the retirement of the cruel invaders to their own country. Abeokuta now breathes again. The public heart pulsates with the regularity which proceeds from a feeling of security. But unless some measures more efficacious than any hitherto, be adopted by or for her, that feeling of security will be only for a few months. The cloud of fear will then again overshadow her; her territory will be again invaded, her farms pillaged and burned, and her children carried away by a cruel and remorseless foe (a sister servant of Satan) to captivity and slaughter at Abomey. Even during those few months of security, the paralyzing influence of a future fear will arrest the hand of willing industry; labour will not be applied, where the results that should reward it may be destined to fall into the possession of the dreaded enemy; and soil which might be made fruitful will remain barren and uncultivated, to the increase of individual poverty and national enfeeblement. All this might be avoided. Security might be obtained, and the signal chastisement of the enemy be made certain. But for this there must be a generally acknowledged supremacy of one man, or of a body of men, in Abeokuta. There must be some authority which commands all the will and the obedience of the community. A house divided against itself is on the verge of ruin. As union is strength, so discord is feebleness; as union would help toward victory and power, so discord must precipitate defeat and ruin. We want to see Abeokuta achieve victory and power. But to achieve an end, means must be used. If Abeokuta be so divided that, of its own volition, it is unable to take the first steps toward that condition of security which is indispensable to the strength that it needs, the educated children of Abeokuta—the children whom God, in His all-wise providence, led to Sierra Leone through the holds of slave-ships—they and their descendants, elevated by education, and in many instances, we hope, by personal Christianity, ought to go in to her aid. We said in our July number that the security and entire delivery of Abeokuta from the cruel pest and terror of Dahomey, ought to be an object near to the heart of all of them. We desire to enforce this upon them. Abeokuta should be the central spot toward which all their desires and affections tend. They should be all apostles and helpers in the work of her deliverance and strength. Their souls should know no peace until Abeokuta become a praise, a joy, and a glory in Western Africa. How? they will ask, or rather we hope they will ask. The first step seems to us to be, by an union among them, with this end, object, and aim—such an union as they have often been accused of in Sierra Leone, for advancing each other's individual interests against the community at large. But this union should be an open and avowed one. All should be members of an Abeokuta club—all, whether at Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, Lagos, or elsewhere—to bring their united strength and influence to bear on the great question of Abeokutan security and pre-eminence. The golden cord to unite them must be Christianity. There can be no deliverance and independence for Abeokuta without this. Heathenism can never accomplish it. We see nothing in the uncontrolled heathenism of Abeokuta to entitle it to any preference over that of Abomey.

It has now been sufficiently established that the Africans are receptive, that they are easily taught not only the rudiments of education, but when good masters are found for them, and they are placed under a good system, the higher branches also. We are not, therefore, asking the British Government to take a leap in the dark—to organize educational institutions without absolute knowledge as to whether the people are capable of receiving education. We could point to members of that once despised African race who occupy really an eminent position in law and medicine; and if we have not yet skilled engineers among them, it is only because there have not yet been inducements among them to the cultivation of those sciences whose mighty power is at this time revolutionizing the world. There is every possible encouragement, therefore, to the British Government in entering upon the noble work which we maintain that it is now their duty to undertake and set about in right good earnest. We would have two superior institutions established, one at Lagos and the other at Accra. These settlements and seats of Government are at so little distance from each other, and the facilities for passing from the one to the other are so frequent and so good, that one supreme organizing and superintending educational head would suffice for both. It is not a little feeble, glimmering light that we thirst to see introduced at those important points of West Africa, but one in educational power that shall resemble the electric among illuminating flames. Great Britain will thus, indeed, justify her presence and extend her beneficent influence on the West Coast of Africa. The work of African civilization is an immense work; the means employed, to be worth anything, must be commensurate with the end to be obtained. We need for those West African countries a host of African evangelists and apostles of civilization; we ask that ignorance shall be beaten down by an array of educational power capable of overcoming its inertia, conquering its will, and subduing to itself its sympathies and its love. Oh, 'tis a glorious work to be undertaken, a glorious aim to be accomplished—a work and an aim worthy of a Government that has taken seriously in hand the deliverance of South-eastern Europe from the paralyzing influences of a rule under which every noble aspiration has been strangled, and the commonest principles of humanity have been outraged and trampled under foot. And we cannot conceive on what ground such a work can be any longer neglected and delayed. That the whole civilized world, and more especially Great Britain and the other European countries, have the deepest possible interest in the civilization of Africa, and that development of her wondrous resources which can only take place through the diffusion of civilization, is beyond all doubt; and since West Africa herself, under the organizing and administrative help of Great Britain, can be made to furnish the means, we earnestly exhort the Secretary of State for the Colonies to plant there without delay that tree of knowledge which alone can effect it. It is only thus that the prophecies of a Buxton and a Palmerston can be fulfilled; and Africa become the glory, instead of the reproach and disgrace, of the Christian civilized world.""}, {'id': 5092, 'article_title': 'The Congo and the Conference in Reference to Commercial Geography', 'full_section_title': 'The Congo and the Conference in Reference to Commercial Geography', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_05_1885', 'content': 'Here I hold a paper signed by M. Arntz, in which the question given to him was—""Can the independent chiefs of savage tribes cede their States?"" This question presents two aspects—first, the rights of the grantor; secondly, the rights of the grantee. First, they say, with regard to the law of nations, we must ask ourselves whether the chiefs of savage tribes can make treaties, &c., or whether the tribes they represent are considered as States capable of making international treaties. The answer given was, that the rules of the law of nations had been looked upon as the special privilege of Christian races; and it was only in 1856 the Porte, by the Treaty of Paris, was permitted to participate in the advantages of international law and of the European concert. Therefore his opinion is that it was obligatory on these nations that they should recognize these laws, and they could not allow those nations to participate in its advantages who did not recognize this law as obligatory upon themselves. Publicists and moralists taught that Christian sovereigns should conduct themselves honestly, and observe the rules and justice of equity and Christian morality. Feeble, half-savage races, deprived as yet of the benefits of civilization, are now no longer considered merely as prey for the rapacity of civilized nations, or as furnishing a field for their enterprise. But what are the conditions under which a State can be capable of negotiating treaties? According to Klüber, a certain number of men and families congregating together, and fixing their abode in a country, associating themselves and submitting to a common chief with the purpose of insuring the safety of all, form a State. Sovereignty is acquired by a State at the time of its formation, or when it frees itself from a condition of dependence. Therefore, only territories without masters, that is, those in which no sovereign power is as yet established, can be rightfully available for occupation.'}]","[{'document_title': '1863 AND 1864, AND THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'filthiness, she glories in her vileness, and feels no need of renovation.

Why are we urging this upon the Government—upon governors, and upon subjects? Because with an increase of the useful power of civilised government in the interior, those roads will also act as a curb to the aggressive instincts of Ashantee—as stimulants to increased production, because affording facilities for increased commerce—as placing the engines of civilization in immediate contact with the hitherto unmitigated barbarous superstitions of Ashantee; and rendering it possible for the missionary society labouring in the protectorate to advance and maintain its outposts, in an efficient state at a considerable distance from the Coast without a ruinous expense, and without that dangerous and weakening isolation which has hitherto almost neutralised the zeal and devotion of its indefatigable agents.\n\nIn such a country as Africa, and among such people as the Africans, the power of Christian civilization must be exhibited wherever there are efforts for inculcating Christianity, if these latter are to have any corresponding success.

They could not fail surely and more or less rapidly to ameliorate the social condition of a people which, amid tropical luxuriance, suffers most frightful privations.

Such palpable evidences that Christianity has the ""promise of the life that now is"" will dispose them the more readily to believe that it has also indeed and in truth ""the promise of that which is to come."" And in our humble opinion it is as much the duty of a Christian people to exhibit such material evidences to the heathen, as adjuncts to missionary teaching, as it is their duty to send the latter. The material blessings which God has bestowed upon the world through Christianity ought to be pressed into his service as allies of Gospel truth.

Among the political events we are inclined to regard that which has cast down thrones in Germany, and seems to be culminating in a new German Empire, as chief in menace and in promise. It has roused strong animosities, and may lead to new combinations of powers for working out those changes which are coming upon the earth. We have no prophetic spirit—we do not profess to know what even a day or an hour may bring forth; but we feel, and we hope that all our friends both in Europe and in Africa will feel with us, that these are times in which we cannot be too zealous in the performance of those works which have been given us to do. We know that our work is to bring all the forces that we can command to bear for promoting and furthering the Christian civilization of Africa. And if this duty is ours, how much more evidently is it that of every educated African. There is no hope for Africa but in that civilization, as there is scarcely an educated African anywhere who does not owe the education he has received directly or indirectly to Christian effort on behalf of him and of his race. The governing authorities would have left him everywhere in the thraldom of ignorance and degrading superstition, even when freeing him from absolute bodily slavery to his fellow-man; but various Christian organizations have, in obedience to the Divine command, come forward in his behalf and to his rescue, with results which are scoffed at and derided only by those who would have used his race for ever as victims of their interests, and of all those evil passions by the indulgence of which they who are not Christ\'s work out the devil\'s work on earth. This very fact, even supposing no love of Christ in his heart, no religious feeling to have been generated in or brought home to him with the knowledge he has received, ought not only strongly to impress every educated African with a sense of duty, but to show him clearly and unmistakably in what direction his path of duty lies. In striving to advance his own individual earthly interests, whether in science, trade, commerce, agriculture, or manufacture, let him keep constantly in view that all he has received by which he has been made to differ from the most filthy and degraded of the savages of his race, is the fruit of advancing Christian civilization, and of that alone; and keeping this in view he will not, and cannot, fail in combining with exertions for his own personal advantage and aggrandisement, equally constant and strenuous efforts for the spread of that same civilization on the continent and in the islands which he inhabits. European Christians have begun the work among the Africans, and they will not abandon it; those to whom we now write are the first-fruits of that work; but to spread widely abroad among their race the Christian civilization which has been to them individually as the breath of life, raising them up to stand before the world as fellow-men, and vindicate their claim to the equal possession with others of every land and hue of those mental endowments which divide, as by a line of eternal fire, man from the brute—to spread widely abroad this Christian civilization among their fellow Africans, is the task manifestly allotted to Africans. It is on this ground, among others, that we advocated and enforced in our last the assuming by the community of Sierra Leone of the expense of that educational work among them hitherto at the charge of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, that the funds now thus appropriated by those societies may be set free for commencing similar work in other West African districts. And it is on this ground also that we are so anxiously endeavouring to stimulate them to the production and demand among the natives of new articles for commerce. All civilization must have material resources upon which it may feed, by which it may be supported and strengthened. Christian civilization, and bodily filth and misery as the characteristics of the whole mass of the people, cannot co-exist. As the former progresses, the arts of civilization and the ameliorations of civilized existence must go with it; and these cannot go with it unless the earth is made to ""yield her increase"" by the application to it of a certain organized industry, which it will never receive except under the impulse of a trading demand. The natural riches of Western Africa are enormous, and are such as will sooner or later support a commerce to which that at present existing on the Coast is merely fractional; but for this the means must be employed by those whom God is manifestly raising up for the work. And lastly, it is on this ground that we call upon all the European employés of the British Crown in Africa to use the means and power of their position for helping on the educated Africans in that propaganda of civilization of which we have been treating. The Parliamentary Committee of 1865 has declared in favour of the preparation of Africans for self-government; and whatever may have been the opinions previously entertained by governors and others in authority on the Coast, from that moment it has become additionally their duty to bring the educated Africans into consultation and into participation in power, as regards the revenues to be raised among them, and the mode in which and the objects for which those revenues shall be spent.

The swarthy races in Africa have not done their part in this great work to which the Creator appointed mankind. It has yet to be accomplished, and the time seems now to be at hand for it to commence. The fringe of the continent has been touched at divers places by the hand of civilization, but only, so far, to show how lamentably inadequate and inoperative were the means hitherto employed. We shall not particularize, because the fact is patent to every one. The agencies now at work seem, however, to promise much more extensive and satisfactory results. We had intended to enter largely on their consideration this month, but although we place before our readers a portion of the public intelligence relating to them, we have determined to postpone that consideration at least until our next number. The spirit of civilized progress now claiming Africa has put forth its claims with so much vigour, at so many points, and in so many diverse ways; the public attention and interest are invited and demanded so persistently and forcibly; the torpor of the African peoples if left to themselves, and their utter inability of themselves, or by the aid of mere trading or missionary effort, to make even the smallest advances towards civilization and Christianity, has become so incontestable,—that we look forward now confidently not only to a continuance of mercantile enterprise and the efforts of Christian philanthropy in its yearning for African souls, but to the speedy operation, also, of Governments and associations in furtherance of those claims. Yes, thanks be to God, we see such forces marshalling to assail the power of Satan, the evil enemy of mankind, in Africa and throughout Africa, that, although we cannot but deplore what seems to us the mistaken award of Marshal MacMahon as regards the right of sovereignty over Delagoa Bay—respecting which we shall have something to say in our next issue—we can rejoice, and we do rejoice, in spirit. Our soul is made jubilant within us by those foreseen and anticipated new conquests of the Gospel of our Blessed Lord which are certain to attend the steps of invading civilization. It is something to have been permitted to live and labour in our humble way for this; and something more to be allowed to behold the dawning of that day for the faint herald-rays of which we have been praying and watching in gloom and darkness. We feel and know that He to whom all power has been given in heaven and on earth, is about to come and establish His universal sovereignty, and this present awakening of interest for and in Africa is to us a new sign of His speedy coming.

That the Mohammedan negro has reached a more real civilization, a higher stage of education, and a richer mean of material prosperity than his Christian brother is certain. One of the most obvious explanations of this, of course, is that while Arab missionaries have been at work in Africa for many centuries, the effort to Christianize its peoples is of very recent origin. Moreover, the negro Mohammedan has access to an ancient and poetic literature, and he has availed himself of it to a far wider extent than might be supposed. Dr. Blyden thinks that the spread of the English language will have a powerful effect in arresting the progress of Islamism; and he may be right. He is sanguine that Christianity must ultimately be the dominant faith of Africa. That it should be so is apart from purely religious considerations, of vast practical importance, since Christianity alone offers adequate safeguards against the continuance of the slave trade.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The spread of Christianity, Islam and western education was another important impact of colonialism. There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Both the new elite and the urban proletariat were important as agents making for change in rural colonial society, but the former were indis› putably the more important in the political, economic and social history of colonial Africa.

The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education. Literacy was for many African peoples a new magic, and was sought after as such and at all costs since it appeared to open the treasure house of the modern world. To know the amount of power, authority and influence which the first generation of African clerks, interpreters and teachers exercised is to have some idea of the spell which literacy cast over many African peoples.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and jingoism to hear it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 65, 'article_title': 'EXTRACT FROM A JOURNAL KEPT ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.—No. II.', 'full_section_title': 'EXTRACT FROM A JOURNAL KEPT ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.—No. II.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_12_1862', 'content': '\n\nanger than the others, and we were told that it was the House of Audience, where his Majesty would receive us, but that by some mischance or mistake he had not arrived from his residence at the other town. We were invited to sit down under a large tree on two old chairs, which perhaps once had seen better days, for they were English. Mr. M. exclaimed at the want of punctuality, and declared we would only stay twenty minutes, when, if the King did not arrive, we would return. Now, imagine us sitting side by side (I in my best blue jacket and a pair of scarlet plaid trousers, and a fireaway cap; Mr. M. in a costume of equal splendour), with a few hundred blackies round about, one face behind another, like an assemblage at a circus. We did our best to contain ourselves and behave with due gravity, seeing that all were silent and respectful—the elders who came forth to meet us at our feet reclining on mats. I looked at my shoes, and Mr. M. ditto; but accidentally raising his eyes, they fell on the countenance of an old woman, who was sitting smoking a pipe. He touched me, and whispered, ""Look on your left, in the second row, at that old woman."" I did look, and it was too much; I burst out laughing, and he also. Such a funny face I never beheld—so serious and yet so comic. She was puffing out smoke through her nose, and seemed so absorbed in contemplating us, there seemed such a mixture of absurdity and consequence about her, that it was inimitable. I exclaimed, ""O for Hogarth\'s pencil! What would I not give for a sketch!"" The ice being broken, we both looked about us, and certainly we had a rich treat in quizzing them. Our twenty minutes being nearly up, we determined to give them only ten minutes more of our company, and then off. At the stated moment up we jumped, and a great scamper there was. I suppose they thought we were going to eat them, for they fled in all directions, except some of the older and wiser ones, who pressed us to stay, for that the King was certainly on the road, and would shortly arrive. We would not; for I wanted to proceed further, and view the country, especially as a high hill was at no great distance, and I wished to mount it, and feel again as if in my own country. None can imagine how dear a hill is, when long used to flat plains, or the monotony of the sea. We mounted our hammocks and went in the direction. Our guide told us we should have to pass through another town, where dwelt a former king (now deposed) but still retaining the title ""King Tom."" In this country the monarchy is elective, and one man cannot reign beyond four or five years, when the throne is put up for auction, and knocked down to the highest bidder, if the rest of the people are satisfied; but if two parties arise, then there is a small palaver, and a small war—a few men get killed, and the victorious chief is made king. Well, this old King was at home, and after we had sat down at the entrance of the town, to give him time for dressing, he sent us word he was ready, and we must proceed. We went forward, and was soon in the presence of his august Majesty. He wore an old faded blue and red cotton velvet cloak, trimmed with brass lace, a present from some former trader in slaves, I suppose. He was sitting at the door of his hut with a mat spread, and a low bench placed for us to occupy. He shook hands, and said in good English, he was glad to see us. He was a fine old man, with a flowing white beard, and the most intelligent native I have seen. He could converse well; spoke, in addition to English, French and Portuguese. He told us how many presents he had received from different white men when he was in power, and amongst other curiosities showed us a small Bible which an American captain had given him. It was half eaten away with ants and worms, and he certainly had no more idea of its contents or knowledge of religion than a stone. We gave the old King the presents we had intended for the other, and we told him we wished to ascend the hill and view the country. He immediately tried to dissuade us, and told us no white man had ever been up. One only (a Spaniard), a long time ago, attempted it, and for his temerity he got his reward—""he never came down to tell what he saw, for a snake chopped him."" We were highly amused at this story, and if we needed any further spur to induce us to be off, this would have been enough, for we felt that there was some hidden cause for his objecting to our going, and our curiosity was excited to the utmost. We had no sooner declared our determination, than plenty of volunteers were ready to accompany us, and we found there was no cause for any fears. A tolerable footpath led right up to the top, and half-an-hour presented us with the noblest scene I think I ever beheld. Far down below our feet was the river which we now saw for the first time winding along, its banks verdant with corn and every production of a tropical clime. Oranges and limes, cotton and sugar cane, all growing wild in great luxuriance. We could trace it far inland, now hidden with trees, and then again shining bright like a sheet of silver. It seemed not like a continued stream, but a succession of small lakes, each one more beautiful than the other. Sometimes it was lost for a long distance by wooded hills, and then again you caught a peep of it afar off, until, at last, it was hidden beyond a range of lofty mountains. We were both entranced, and could only say, ""How beautiful!"" ""How beautiful!"" Our next wish was that we could trace it to its source, and sadly lamented that business would not allow it at present. After we had drunk in all the beauties of the prospect we descended to the river\'s bank, and a difficult task it was, all rocky and thick bushwood. I led the way (for I flatter myself few can excel me up or down a mountain track). Every moment we started a monkey, which would skip about from pinnacle to pinnacle, and chatter and grin as if in derision of our clumsiness. After many hairbreadth escapes we got to the bottom, regaled ourselves with some wild water melons, and continued our course down the river side. Not far off we discovered a canoe anchored near the bank. We determined to embark, and find out the depth of the water in the middle of the stream, and if it were navigable for a vessel of any burthen. In we jumped, Mr. M. taking one paddle and I another. We went along famously, and found, by the aid of a long stick, that the depth was considerable, being upwards of twelve feet. Having landed again, we journeyed on, a few of the natives who had kept with us being our guides. By a long circuitous route we reached the town where our own men, hammocks, &c., were in waiting. His Majesty sent his compliments, and would be glad if we would stay and dine with him; but being tired, and a long way from our house, we declined the honour, and once more got into our hammocks, and went off on a gallop, pursued by all the idle boys and dogs in the village, and (shall I tell it?) the ladies had lost their bashfulness, and came scampering along laughing, and evidently highly amused. At last, making an exceedingly ungraceful curtsey, they said, in their language, as our interpreter informed us, ""Farewell, white man.""

Mr. Young, in his little steamer, reached that place on the 16th, having, as we know by former letters, left the Rongoni mouth of Zambesi on the morning of Aug. 12. He writes in capital spirits, as he and all his party were well, and his steamer had proved a success. The expedition had not, however, escaped without misfortune, for one of the two sailing boats sent on ahead by Mr. Young had been capsized, some of her native crew drowned, and nearly all the personal luggage belonging to the members of the mission lost. The Englishman in charge of the boat fortunately escaped.\n\nThey found the Zambesi rather low, but such was to be expected at that season of the year. The Sheri river, into which\n**81**\n\nthey will turn after ascending another fifty miles, is always deeper, flowing as it does direct from the great Lake Nyassa. Already the news of Mr. Young's arrival had been passed up country, and he was met at Mazaro by his faithful old servant, John Gaitty, who, it will be remembered, accompanied him as one of his boat's crew when he performed his famous expedition into the heart of Africa to ascertain whether the reported death of Dr. Livingstone was true or false. The poor fellow expressed great delight at again meeting his former master, and assured Mr. Young that his old boat's crew would soon assemble again to take service under him. No trouble had been experienced in getting natives to work, nor have we reason to anticipate any, seeing how invariably well they were treated by our countrymen in times gone by.\n\nWe may fairly expect that Mr. Young reached Chibisa, at the head of the Sheri, below the Murchison Falls, by the end of August, and, allowing him a month to carry his steamer and goods past the falls, and put the vessel together again, he probably launched on the lake about the first week in October, which would leave him ample time to establish the mission station on Cape Maclear, and explore the lake before the rainy season set in, in November. There is every reason why we should be satisfied with the progress made; some of the greatest difficulties have been overcome, and though there still remains much which must try both the courage and devotion of all concerned, still under such a leader as Mr. E.

JOSEPH THOMSON ON EUROPEAN INTERCOURSE WITH AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Joseph Thomson, the African explorer, lectured at Edinburgh, on January 11, on ""The result to the African of European intercourse."" There was a large attendance.\n\nThe Lecturer, after observing that one of the most remarkable features of the century had been the phenomenal interest displayed in all things African, and that people\'s imaginations had been touched by the varied story of the Dark Continent, drew attention to the apparently unselfish form of the public interest manifested in Africa. The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In that letter Mr. Rosenbush, who has been eighteen years resident at Sierra Leone, states, as an incontrovertible fact, that missionary efforts have produced very beneficial results—that the most cursory comparison of the people of Sierra Leone, composed in a great measure of Africans liberated from the holds of slave-ships, with the natives of places where the influence of missionaries is not known, will establish this without dispute. We refer our readers again to his letter on this very important point, because we feel that as the past has depended, so the future must in no small degree depend, on this of late most calumniated body of men. Whatever may be the other measures adopted for the advancement of Africa, any relaxation of the efforts of missionaries would be a result deeply to be deplored by every one who is looking and labouring for the day of African regeneration. Mr. Rosenbush\'s views so intimately coincide with our own as to the means by which ""improvement and civilization"" may be best advanced in the colony of Sierra Leone, that we may be excused again entering largely upon them at this time. The agricultural improvement of the colony demands the special attention of Government authorities; and when, as in this case, a means is pointed out which only requires a better disposal of the revenues raised in the colony itself, by making them instrumental in obtaining reproductive results from the enforced labour of the criminal portion of the population, instead of that labour being wasted, as at present, no trivial objections or inapplicable theories ought to be allowed to stand in the way of its adoption. There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil. As Christian civilization had to be introduced from Europe, so must the impulse to agricultural industry be introduced from Europe also.

It gives us new tastes, at the same time that it affords the means for their gratification; it enables us to compare our own laws, institutions, and manners with those of the Europeans, to profit by their example, or to take warning by their fate. Let us compare Lagos thirty-five years ago with Lagos today, and we have a striking instance of the potency of commerce as a civilizing agent. Lagos thirty-five years ago—ruled over by a despot, at whose nod a soul could be hurried into eternity; Lagos with its idolatry, its slave barracoons, its bush and miserable mud huts. Lagos of today—an emporium of legitimate commerce, a place of refuge for slaves, a centre of civilization; law, order, and justice, the rule and not the exception; the bush substituted for roads; in place of mud huts, with their thatched roofs, that fall so easy a prey to fire, we are having substantial brick buildings, with iron or slate roofs; the churches, the schools; the moral and mental improvement of the natives—are not these proof enough of the good wrought by commercial intercourse with Europe? Well, I will give one more instance. In 1873, domestic slavery was abolished on the Gold Coast. By force of arms? No!

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

With every trading colony of any size—that is to say, where there are more than three or four trading houses—there is a medical officer, jointly paid by the various firms.\n\nPerhaps in no body of Englishmen abroad has such an improvement taken place as in the class of men who now conduct the trade with the natives in West Africa. In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa. Yearly the improvement continues; more and more the great trading companies of Liverpool and Bristol have realised that their interests are better served by men of good manners and refinement.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ""COMING"" CONTINENT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In an article, entitled ""Africa for Africans,"" published in a magazine issued in Washington, U.S.A., the vast possibilities of progress and development possessed by this continent are so eloquently and aptly set forth that we quote the passage *in extenso*:\n\n""Africa is to-day the object of more interest on the part of a larger number of people than any other quarter of the globe. England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern. Captain Burton has asserted that he knows nothing to equal the prodigious wealth of the land, even in California, or in the Brazils. \'Gold dust is panned by native women from the sands of the sea shore.

Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""Another group of White Fathers left Tabora and went westwards to set up a mission station at Ujiji in 1879 and from there to Rumonge in Burundi, some 120km south of the present Bujumbura, but the station was abandoned in 1881 after the massacre of three missionaries there. 'The White Fathers were not able to return to their mission for almost fifty years'.$^{58}$ In 1885 the White Fathers took over two stations near Ujiji, which had been established by the African International Association after King Leopold of Belgium had decided to concentrate his efforts in the Congo Free State.\nUntil 1884, therefore, European pressures in the East African hinterland were mainly exerted by missionary societies. Even where there existed commercial activities, they were offshoots of missionary work. Two such examples existed. The first was the Livingstonia Central African Trading Company, which was associated with Scottish missionary activities in the Lake Nyasa region. Its aim was said to be that of supplying the mission station at Blantyre with necessities through running steamships in the waterways of the region and also that of bringing ivory for commerce at a price that would undercut the Arab merchants using slave labour for porterage. The second example is also associated with the Scottish Free Church. A member of the Church, William Mackinnon, who owned the British India Steam Navigation Company, started running ships to Zan› zibar in 1872. A few years later he was able to convince the sultan of Zanzibar to approve his plan for building roads to Lake Nyasa and Lake Victoria.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': 'In Southern Africa, even greater attention was paid to education than in other parts of Africa, thanks partly to the grants-in-aid that were given by the governments of the Cape and Natal during the period.

They demanded the transport and marketing infra› structure, seizing the opportunity as soon as a railway line was completed. In many cases, they pioneered before the colonial governments had built bridges and feeder roads. Seed for new crops were taken from the colonial governments, from missionaries, from European farms and from Africans who were already engaged in cultivation. Cocoa and coffee are the two best known and most important of the cash crops whose extension relied mainly on African initiatives. Minor crops such as tea, tobacco and pyrethreum also bear out the same principle. Besides, Africans fought specifically for crops which were better money-earners than others. In the case of cocoa, this meant cultivating lands which were only marginally suitable. At other times, African preference precipitated a struggle against discriminatory colonial legislation. Thus, the latter part of the 1920s and the early 1930s saw a determined effort on the part of Africans in several highland areas of Tanganyika to cultivate Arabica coffee rather than hire their labour out or grow the less profitable Robusta variety. The Africans won literally by planting coffee trees faster than the colonial administration could destroy them. 10 Where peasant cultivation established itself as the hegemonic form of the colonial economy, it functioned like mines and plantations in drawing labour resources from an area much wider than the actual zone of production. Senegambian groundnut farming attracted seasonal labour from the hinterland of the Senegal and Niger rivers; cocoa in the Gold Coast and in the Ivory Coast drew upon Upper Volta; while Ugandan coffee-growers turned to Ruanda-Urundi and Tanganyika to expand output. Together, cash-crop farming and the wage labour of mines and agri› culture accounted for the overwhelming majority of Africans who partici› pated directly in the colonial economy. However, a host of other activities were generated or transformed by the new commodity relationships. It was rather late before the extensive forest reserves of the continent were seriously maximized, but an extractive timber industry arose early in Gabon and in varying degrees some such enterprise was pursued wherever forest reserves existed.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Infrastructure', 'content': ""One of the most important aspects of marketing is infrastructure.

Most railways ran directly from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. Only a few lateral and inter-colonial links were established. Railways therefore served only limited areas, and, important as they have been, their role in 'opening up' the continent has certainly been exaggerated.$^{86}$ Only in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa were there more sophisticated railway networks, mainly intended to connect and serve the widely-scattered mining areas and settler farming regions.

To be sure, a certain number of territories offered a wide range of products: cotton, coffee, sugar cane, sisal and maize in Angola; coconuts, groundnuts and rice in Mozambique; wood in Gabon and the Ivory Coast; and bananas in Guinea. But exports continued to be based almost exclusively on minerals and oil-yielding plants. Few territories were as favourably situated as the Belgian Congo, whose improvement was based, at best, on two or three groups of products which, at least, were already partially processed. These were vegetable oil whose production increased from 2500 tonnes in 1914 to 9000 in 1921 and 65000 in 1930; and copper, which tripled between 1922 and 1931, from 43000 to 120000 tonnes before falling again the following year to 54000 tonnes, as a result of a reduction in production decided upon by international agreements.\nSource: S.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Secondly, the decreased cost of transport increased the profit margins of producers and encouraged the expansion of the cash sector.

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads. Nor were they meant to facilitate inter-African travel and communication. Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts. In the second place, such economic growth as occurred in the colonies was based on the natural resources of the area and this meant therefore that areas not naturally endowed were totally neglected.

African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported. However, in East Africa the 'Asian' merchants were essential for keeping the money economy intact and avoiding reversion to barter, just as their capital had been the original basis for the extension of specie and small-scale money exchanges throughout the region.$^{16}$ In the final analysis, therefore, the British administration co-operated to protect the interests of these retailers and produce buyers.

If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states.

To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth.

Your energy, courage, enterprise, and resource have made that work a splendid and unique success, and you have shown the nations of Europe how a vast free equatorial state can be projected and realized. All must admire the wonderful diplomatic skill, the unwearied patience, and the great forbearance by which, in spite of the wild, war-like, and turbulent character of many of the tribes, you have made your way, step by step, up the Congo for a distance of 1,400 miles to Stanley Falls, in so peaceful and bloodless a manner, and no words are too strong to express the society\'s satisfaction with this feature of your work. With regard to Christian missions to the Dark Continent, it is well known and gratefully recognized that the comparatively recent impetus given to missionary work in Central Africa owes its origin in great measure to you.

The promoters of that and similar efforts in Central Africa have sought with much respect and deference your advice in the carrying out their missionary projects—advice which has always been readily and freely given. It is in regard to your work on the Congo River, however, that the Baptist Missionary Society feels its own particular deep obligations. Owing to the jealously guarded trade interests, our efforts to push the mission into the interior were viewed with suspicion and strenuously opposed by the natives, and the missionaries of the society were forced to have recourse to the route you were opening up from Vivi to Stanley Pool.

This fact the society desires gratefully to recognize, showing, as it does, how much it owes to your work.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country.

George Nicol, Colonial Chaplain of the British Settlements of the River Gambia, who is at present on a visit to this country, desires to draw attention to the following statement: His special work is to minister to the officers of the Colonial Government, the European merchants, and the large and increasing body of Christian traders who are constantly coming into the settlement from Sierra Leone and other parts of the Coast. To these he ministers, and superintends an organization similar to that found in any well-worked parish in England. The congregation is occasionally increased by the visit of one of Her Majesty’s ships. He has also the spiritual charge of the convicts in the gaol and the inmates of the Colonial Hospital. In connection with the Colonial Church at Bathurst there is now a congregation of 200 Christian worshippers and about eighty communicants. The church can only accommodate 250. In addition to the work connected with his chaplaincy, Mr. Nicol recognizes the claims of the heathen upon the Christian Church, and has started three missions for those in and around the town of Bathurst; but as yet has been unable to reach the neighbouring tribes—namely, the Jolas, the Sérérés, the Polos, and the Mandingoes. For upwards of 600 miles higher up the River Gambia, on either bank of that noble river, one mercantile firm alone has seventy trading factories. There is not one resident missionary preaching the Gospel to the people trading with these merchants. Merchant clerks and other traders go up and down the country for the purpose of trade, but there is not one Christian teacher, European or native, who has taken up his residence among the people to learn their language and to instruct them. It is this sad state of things Mr. Nicol is anxious to remedy. He has formed at the Gambia a Native Church Missionary Association, and by the aid of his congregation and the merchants on the spot, has raised 50l. and built a small school chapel on the outskirts of Bathurst which is open daily for service and evangelistic meetings, and where a lay-helper is rendering efficient service. He has also been invited to build another chapel at Albreda, eighty miles up the river.\n\nThe present appeal is for funds to build School Chapels and Mission Houses at several of the most important trading stations. To do this satisfactorily, 1,000l. must be raised; and to maintain the necessary mission agents and teachers, at least 500l. per annum is required.\n\nIt may be added that the Church Missionary Society would rejoice to see this work advanced, though unable themselves to undertake the responsibility of any fresh expenditure in this part of the world; and that the Rev.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE.""

What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support?

It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported.

This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. Stanley on the Congo Railway', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In reference to the _Times_ article upon the above subject, which will be found in another column, Mr. H.

That portion to which I take objection is as follows: ""We may probably take the higher estimate of £2,000,000 as being nearer the mark of the actual expenditure required than the lower, and £2,000,000, it must be admitted, is a very large sum on which to obtain a working profit from the commercial intercourse between the interior of Africa and the external world."" £2,000,000 is undoubtedly a large sum to expend at the first inception of trade development in the basin of the Upper Congo; but the gentlemen connected with the syndicate have no idea of spending such an enormous sum, or any figure approaching it, in the Congo regions. What we proposed was to have the power of increasing the capital to £2,000,000, should circumstances demand such increase. The first issue is to be only for £1,000,000; but in the event of any extraordinary expansion of trade we have reserved the power to increase the capital so as to meet the needs of trade and commerce. £52,000 is paid annually for human porterage of goods and merchandise from the Lower Congo to Stanley Pool. Considering the sparse population, this human porterage is not capable of expansion to any appreciable degree. Animal carriage is impossible unless a road suitable for wheeled vehicles be made between the landing places on the Lower Congo and the nearest landing place above Livingstone Falls. It is the sum now being paid for human porterage by the Congo State authorities and others that has been the basis of our studies. Whether a railway, turnpike, or public road be constructed, this sum must be expended on porterage, unless the French Government, the Congo State Government, and the religious missions were to retire in a body from their possessions on the Upper Congo, which, needless to say, there is very little prospect of their doing.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1886#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

We find a minute of the proceedings of the Society, dated April 7, 1795, to the following effect: ""Inquiries having been made whether there be any farther openings in the heathen world encouraging to attempt the spreading of the kingdom of Christ in it, it appears to us from the Sierra Leone reports, lately published, that such favourable appearances do exist in Africa as deserve our immediate attention."" A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools. The difficulties to be overcome in this mission have been very great; not the least being the necessity of providing the people with written languages. Mr. Saker has translated the Word of God in the Dualla, and has compiled a dictionary and hymn-book.

Why so? Because ministerial discord and dissension are at the bottom of it. One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'RAILWAYS FOR WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Mr. Hutton, of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said that this subject had always been of the greatest interest to the Manchester Chamber, for they were deeply impressed with the necessity for new markets and of the extension of our old ones in order to provide employment for our growing population. For a long time the interests of West Africa had been much neglected, which makes it the more necessary now to miss no opportunity of preventing any further alienation of trade. If railways are laid into the interior the existing trade will be attracted to the cheapest route, and in this way we shall be able to counteract the efforts the French are making to divert the caravans from the interior to French ports. Although we have now been trading with West Africa for over a century we have hardly done more than touch the fringe of the Nigerian Soudan, and the reason is that the roads into the interior are little more than wide ruts through the bush and forest. This is particularly the case on the Gold Coast, where duties were increased, with the object of improving these so-called roads. If railways were constructed these difficulties would disappear, and we should soon see a large and substantial increase in our trade. Had railways been in existence the Jebu and Ashanti expeditions would have cost very much less, and probably there would have been no necessity for them, for with good means of communication it would be easier to maintain friendly relations with the interior chiefs, who would soon recognise that their interests were identical with ours in promoting trade with the Soudan. If the merchant could take his goods into the interior at a reasonable rate, he would find an unlimited demand for his manufactures, and the Native could cultivate his soil to its full capabilities. In this way a new market of enormous possibilities, would be created for British trade. We cannot hope for any great extension of our West African trade under present conditions, but with railways the possibilities of an increase are enormous, as we should then be put in connexion with an industrious race of people and systematic cultivation. He could not speak too strongly about the urgency of the question, for if they delayed too long France or Germany may step in, and one of the best markets in Africa would be lost to this country.\n\nMr. R.

The first came from the unknown number of maroons and Africans taken from confiscated slave ships during the nineteenth century, and shipped back to Africa by the British in their zealous attempt to terminate the trade in slaves and replace it by 'legitimate' trade. The second source of African returnees came from an even smaller number of missionaries recruited in the Caribbean and southern states of the USA, principally by the Moravians and Presby› terians, to assist in the propagation of the Christian Gospel in West Africa. The most well-known example of this is perhaps the Basel Mission enterprise among the Akwapim hills of Ghana in the 1830s and 1840s, and their decision in 1843 to use Jamaicans as substitutes for German and Swiss missionaries whose mortality in the field proved too high for evan› gelical efficacy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora and Africa', 'content': ""While Africans who came to the New World can be numbered in millions, their descendants who returned to Africa amounted to only a few thousands.$^{56}$ Many reasons account for this, not the least of which was the significant lack of support to establish the type of transportation system which had previously facilitated the westward trans-Atlantic flow. Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found.

This approach was used by Octavio Ianni and Fernando Henrique Cardoso$^{69}$ to study the process by which former slaves entered the free labour market and, subsequently, their integration into the urban economy.\nThis type of analysis makes it possible to evaluate the extent to which the population of African origin is integrated in the economic systems and societies of South America. However, it leaves on one side the continuing prestige of African cultural values in the New World, although of course one may hold the view that this can only be measured by using a racial criterion or that it is not an important variable.\nHere there are two conflicting schools of thought. The position taken by M. J. Herskovits$^{70}$ regarding the 'reinterpretation' of African culture as reflected in continuing cultural elements, provoked the black North American sociologist, E. Franklin Frazier$^{7}$ ' to draw attention to the central problem of integration in society as a whole. As Frazier saw it, Herskovits' theory could lead to the conclusion that the persistence of African cultural values might be regarded as evidence supporting the racialist argument that blacks cannot be assimilated. In the United States, on account of various factors including the work of the Protestant churches, the former slaves lost most of their traditional African cultural values and became part of the Anglo-Saxon cultural world.\nThe parallel between North America and South America and the Caribbean in terms of the African presence and particularly of African cultural values is not conclusive, for the situations were very different in view of the different ways in which the former slaves became 'integrated' in those regions, even from one country to another.\nFrom the cultural standpoint, whereas in the United States conversion to the Protestant religion led to the forsaking of cultural traditions and to the emergence of a new outlook, in Latin America and the Caribbean African cultural values persisted to varying degrees or underwent a process of transformation.\nMethodologically, two forms of presence should be distinguished: the cultural presence of Africa and the Negro presence in the physical sense.

These changes naturally affected, in turn, the culture of these three areas, and contributed to a sharper distinction and discrimination of each region's peculiar culture. 48 Part of this reality, of course, was the bewildering variation in the situation in which an arriving African could find himself. In the Caribbean, the Africans formed the majority of the population. The phenotype was self-evidently black. In the USA on the other hand, black phenotypes were a minority of the national population, however concentrated they might have been in some individual states. In parts of Latin America such as Ecuador, Chile and Argentina, the blacks had virtually disappeared genetically among the American Indian and European groups, illustrating a broad spectrum of biological intermixture. 49 Nor did the demographic evolution of the regions follow the logical pattern of relative participation in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The AfroAmerican components of American societies did not necessarily correspond to the proportion of Africans imported during the centuries of the slave trade. Brazil, for example, imported about 4 million slaves during the course of the trade, a figure which, as we have noted, was approximately 38 per cent of the trans-Atlantic trade.$^{50}$ At the end of slavery in 1890, Brazil had an Afro-American population of about 4 million, which comprised 33 per cent of the local Brazilian population and about 36 per cent of the total Afro-American population of the western hemisphere. The Caribbean region imported approximately 5 million slaves, or 43 per cent of the trade, and when the last Caribbean island to abolish slavery - Cuba - did so in 1886, the region had a mere 3 million Afro-Americans, which, while they averaged about 60 per cent of the local regional population, accounted for only 18 per cent of the total Afro-Americans in the hemisphere.

Of this number, 41 per cent went to Brazil, 35 per cent went to the fledgling British, Dutch and French colonies (mainly in the circum-Caribbean region), and 22 per cent went to Spanish America. This was the period in which the fully organized, highly capitalized transAtlantic slave trade began. The annual average importation rate rose from about 1800 Africans during the sixteenth century, to more than 17 000. The declining relative participation of the Spanish reflected the demographic recovery of the mainland Indian populations. But the slack in the Spanish sector was more than compensated for by the increasing demand for labourers in the expanding Brazilian sugar zones of the north-east, and the developing socio-economic complex based on sugar production in the eastern Caribbean islands.\nThe eighteenth century constituted the apogee of the African migration to the Americas. Both the plantation societies in the Americas and the slave trade which supplied the manpower needs reached their fullest maturity. Between 1700 and 1810 more than half of all the Africans ever to come to the New World arrived: perhaps far more than 6 million Africans.

In general American societies were hostile to Africans and African culture.\nNevertheless, the impact of Africa was inescapable in many aspects of American society: phenotype, language, music, religion, cuisine, art, agriculture and architecture. In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white. The relatively small number of white persons at the top of the social pyramid in most societies afforded the dominant African majorities the opportunity to impose their values and their cultures on the rest of the society.\nWithin the three-tiered structure each caste had its own set of legal rights and social privileges based on a combination of wealth, colour and occupation. In the sugar and plantation-based economic zones of Brazil, the Caribbean, and the lowlands of Mexico, Colombia and Peru, the rights of slaves as well as free persons of colour tended to be circumscribed in direct proportion to the overall demands of their labour. In the coffee, cattle and fishing areas of south-eastern Brazil, Puerto Rico, eastern Cuba, and the interior provinces of Venezuela and Argentina, social mobility tended to be greater, social distances shorter, and internal class and caste distinctions more relaxed and less formal than in the plantation zones.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class.

Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'Introduction', 'content': 'Africans and Afro-Americans, both as slaves and as free persons, helped subdue the vast wildernesses everywhere throughout the Americas from Alaska to Argentina.

They actively participated in forging the new communities which formed the bases for the later heterogenous and polyphonous societies.

Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did.

It was on the 1st of August, 1834, that an Act of the British Parliament came into force by which the abolition of the last vestiges of slavery in British dominions was effected. To Englishmen of the present generation it seems impossible that slavery, which had been for centuries illegal in Great Britain, should be not only tolerated, but absolutely supported—and in its very worst and vilest form—by the same laws which made all in England free. Those who never knew what the Western slave-trade was cannot even conceive its horrors. And yet men like Clarkson and Wilberforce had to toil year after year, and session after session, to make their own countrymen see that such a state of society was opposed to the spirit of Christianity, and that, with such an incubus, the true material progress of a nation was impossible. The present century was some years old before the terrible evils of the foreign slave-trade were put down by force; and slavery, as a ""domestic institution,"" was allowed to linger on for three and twenty years later. It is a matter of history that even then the Parliament of Great Britain was called upon to pay £20,000,000 compensation for the loss of service to the slave-owners—though surely that was a tax that was paid willingly enough, and would be paid over again quite as readily if needed. The great outcry of the slave-owners was, at the time of the abolition, that they and the land would be ruined—that those who had only worked because they were compelled would, when compulsion was no longer used, give themselves up to rioting and idleness. There was no doubt much truth in this; the negroes had been for generations treated at the best as naughty children, and it was only fair and reasonable to expect that when once the whip which had so long been held over their backs was removed, they would behave as such. But the fact, we are glad to say, was far otherwise. As a general rule, the negroes were, by the gift of their freedom, urged on to higher things. That which had been necessarily in many cases mere ""eye-service,"" became true and loyal labour, by which the employer was to gain and does gain far more than the owner could hope to look for. And there is one other effect of the great abolition which must not be lost sight of. In how many cases has it enabled Africans to return to the country from which, perhaps, they had been torn away in their childhood, but to which, all through their hard trial, their hearts had turned; and to go back, not empty-handed to the land of their birth, but with them bring the treasures of education, civilization, and Christianity, and by this means to help on the coming of the still greater Day of Emancipation when all her sons shall be free from the dark cloud of ignorance and oppression, and the Dark Continent shall once more take her foremost place in wielding the destinies of the world.'}, {'id': 5714, 'article_title': 'The Late Mrs. J.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement.

Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants.

Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The process of suppression', 'content': 'routes for the export and distribution of slaves.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'Although the African diaspora took place mainly through the slave trade, Africans also found their way into the outer world as free people inde› pendent of the slave trade, or as a new phase of life after a period of slavery in the tropical Americas. Indeed, Africans had been present in Western Europe from Classical Antiquity onwards, though the numbers only became substantial from about the fifteenth century on, when black Africans, first as slaves and then as freedmen, began to appear in southern Spain and Portugal, arriving at first by way of the trans-Saharan trade to North Africa. Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did. From 1685, residence in France was held to confer freedom, and the same was true of England after the notable judicial decision of Lord Mansfield in 1772 already noted. In both situations, however, slaves from the colonies were still slaves de facto; in many instances until the European powers abolished slavery in the colonies themselves, in 1834 for Britain, 1848 for France, and 1888 for Brazil.\nIn spite of their ambiguous legal status, free Africans were present in Western Europe in considerable numbers from at least the mid-eighteenth century on. Estimates vary, but by 1800 they would have numbered several thousand in each of Spain, Portugal, France, or Britain; and in Spain or Portugal they would have been more numerous in an earlier period. The numbers were small in any case, compared with total European populations, but the African immigrants tended to be concentrated in the main cities, particularly in the port towns, so that their presence was more visible than their numbers would suggest.$^{31}$ It goes without saying that, for any period before the 1840s, far more people of tropical African descent would have been found in Europe than Europeans in tropical Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'African nationalism and international developments', 'content': ""Kenyatta (Kenya); as well as J.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Every month's experience justifies more and more the views of the African-Aid Society upon this question—views which they have only not carried into practical operation because, hitherto, there have been no funds for the work. To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth.

Dr. Peters said that there were to be found in Africa a number of cool and healthy high plateaux, where the white man could not only live in comfort, but where he found all conditions for agricultural and pastoral pursuits just as in his old country. There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry. A modern traveller had truly said that ""the greatest treasure of Africa consists in the inexhaustible labour force of its inhabitants."" The Native population, which was estimated at about 200 millions, only required to be organised by the whites in order to raise the natural wealth of the continent. A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon. Africa required railways and highways in every part for the purpose of its economic development and civilisation. Rinderpest must be exterminated.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns.

The following is from the monthly organ of the Society: ""It was deeply felt by the Committee that the hope for the evangelization of Africa must mainly rest on the employment of a native agency. The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life.

On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered. The river, the Lomami by name, was found easily navigable and with a good depth. The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town. The communication between Niangwe and Stanley Falls by the Congo is almost impossible, owing to the many falls and rapids; and the Lomami will form a further means of extending protection and bringing civilisation to regions which have suffered much from the Arab raids for slaves."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The River Gambia as a Trading Route to the Interior of North-west Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""We have pretty well worked up about three-fourths of the markets of the world and glutted them, leaving the remainder, Africa, almost untouched; for, as yet, except in South Africa, our trade has but barely penetrated beyond the coast line, and our merchants remain at the outposts competing with each other and over-working the local markets. Expeditions are rapidly following one another and giving us full information about the interior of Equatorial Africa. Railways and canals are proposed for the opening up of that part of Africa, and they will, years hence, no doubt, prove an incalculable benefit; but why should we wait for these costly works? Why not utilize the arteries already provided by nature for traffic with the interior? Northwest Africa is a market to a great extent as yet unworked. The markets of Sego and Timbuctoo, Hamdallahi, and other large towns on the Upper Niger are most inadequately supplied with British goods by caravans from Tunis, Tripoli, Mogador, and Senegal, and the carriage is so expensive that none but the lightest and most valuable can be imported across the desert. Now the French river, Senegal, though it drains the country for over 700 miles, is practically useless as a channel of commerce. It has a bad and dangerous bar. Ships have often to lie outside weeks, and even months, waiting to enter the port of St. Louis. Its channel into the interior is full of sand bars and rocks, obstructing navigation by even small craft for most of the year; and the tribes to the north-east of its head-waters, of Arab origin, are ferocious and predatory, living by plunder; therefore, commerce meets with danger and difficulty in their neighbourhood. About 180 miles to the south is the Gambia, which seems intended by nature to be the main road for commerce, civilization, and religion into North-west Africa. At all states of the tide, at all seasons of the year, you have a deep and safe channel over the bar; vessels of 2,000 to 3,000 tons can come in and anchor off Bathurst, and discharge and load. The traffic up the river is carried on by large cutters and schooners. Even oceangoing vessels of large tonnage go up to M\'Carthy Island, 185 miles from the mouth, and load. Lately, an ocean steamer, of about 900 tons, went there direct from Marseilles, and loaded there; and at the present moment, a French firm trading in Gambia is building a 1,200-ton steamer to run between Marseilles and that island every season, and discharge and load there, instead of breaking bulk at Bathurst. At M\'Carthy Island there are five fathoms of water in mid-channel. Then, vessels drawing ten feet of water can go up to Yarbutenda, 160 miles further; so that had we steamers suited for the trade, like the French vessels I have mentioned, they could load at Liverpool or London, reach Bathurst in twelve days, M\'Carthy Island in twenty-four hours, Yarbutenda in twenty-four hours more, making fourteen days in all.""', 'last_edit_date': '1879-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1879#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH AFRICAN EXPLORATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The writer proceeds to give some interesting information about a European established in these parts, one M.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes.

Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation.

The socio-political impact of Benin on other Edo-speaking peoples as well as the Itsekiri, the Urhobo, and the Isoko to the east and north of Benin has been much more systematically studied. 39 Above all, the nineteenth century witnessed the foundation of the modern settlement pattern in which location along or close to the coast conferred great advantages: witness, for example, the heightened status of Warri visà-vis Benin, Lagos vis-à-vis the rest of Yorubaland, Porto Novo, Whydah and, most spectacular of all, Cotonou on the Aja coast.

There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone. Unfortunately, this integration was effected in a very disadvantageous and exploitative manner for Africa and not even twenty years of independence have funda› mentally altered the situation which has now become known as neo› colonialism."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'elite.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Perhaps the two best examples of this power shift occurred in the northern states of Undi and Kazembe.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions.

Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

The number of troops set apart for this work has had to be considerably augmented, and we hope that this will lead to a large development in trade and in the cultivation of the land in regions which have hitherto been depopulated by the slave-raiders.""\n\n""Does this active interference with the slave trade not raise up enemies?""—""Notwithstanding these operations, the relations with the Mohammedan Emirs continue on the whole friendly, the principal exception being the Emir of Muri, a province to the north of the Upper Benue. Strong pressure has been brought to bear upon him by the Sultan of Sokoto, who is an ally of the Company, and with whom we have a treaty, to bring the Emir to a more pacific frame of mind. There is nothing in this hostility to cause the slightest anxiety, as the Company are perfectly able to cope with any force the Emir of Muri can bring against them. In a vast country split up into a great many separate States and tribes it is impossible to expect that perfect peace should reign, but on the whole the condition of affairs is decidedly pacific and encouraging.""', 'last_edit_date': '1892-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1892#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

There are some who fear lest European influence should become too strong and firmly rooted in our land, and ourselves either down-trodden or swept off the face of the earth. There are two most effectual bars to such an event—our climate, and the present elevated tone of society, which would at once raise up an outcry against tyranny and oppression. If we would only cultivate the spirit of unity and love amongst ourselves, regardless of tribal and personal interests, civilization and religion would progress rapidly, and we should be better fitted to govern ourselves; but until such time, it is best to have foreign government, and strangers to bring order and their improvement. History is always repeating itself, and will do so again in Africa; there will surely come a time when Africa will be civilized, enlightened, and self-governed. In the meantime, there is One who watches over our interests, and will allow no harm to come to us without just cause—who loves us, however degraded we may be.

The Chairman strongly recommended the petitioning of the British Imperial Government, as well as the German Emperor, and the Congress at Berlin, and the Government of France; and spoke strongly against the English monopoly of trade on the Niger, by endeavouring to refuse the natives the medium of conveyance to and from that great river.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home. With every trading colony of any size—that is to say, where there are more than three or four trading houses—there is a medical officer, jointly paid by the various firms.\n\nPerhaps in no body of Englishmen abroad has such an improvement taken place as in the class of men who now conduct the trade with the natives in West Africa. In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion.

In this paper the author described his impressions of the lower part of the Niger and of the Central Soudan acquired in the course of a commercial and political mission last year to the Sultans of Sokoto and Gandu. On his way along the West Coast of Africa he noted the influence for good or evil which contact with white men has had upon the natives, and concluded that while there is much we have reason to be proud of, there is still more of which we ought to feel ashamed. He expressed the opinion that for every negro the missionaries have influenced for good by Christian teaching, a thousand had been driven into deeper degradation by other influences. He also found the settlements absurdly over-governed on a system totally unsuited to the peculiarities of barbarous races. That part of the Niger which the author traversed is divided into three sections according to their physiographical features—(1) the delta, (2) the low-lying region between the delta and the coast mountains, and (3) the irregular valley which has been cut out of the interior plateau. On reaching Lokoja, at the confluence of the Benué with the Niger and the commencement of the third section, the Central Soudan is entered. The changes which occur here, whether physiographical or ethnological, are striking in the extreme. ""Behind us are the unwashed, barbarous *sans culottes* of the coast region, with fetishism, cannibalism, and the gin bottle in congenial union; before us lies a people astir with religious activity and enthusiasm, and wonderfully far advanced in the arts and industries."" Mr. Thomson took occasion to point out the enormous influence for good—though not unmixed—which Mahomedanism exercises among the inhabitants of the Central Soudan. On reaching Rabba in the Kupé country the river journey ended, and the journey to Sokoto had to be continued by means of the ordinary African caravan. The difficulties with the porters were described and the countries traversed were sketched, the route being through Kupé and Yauri to the Gulbi-n-Gindi, which is then followed to the neighbourhood of Sokoto. In conclusion, the author described the commercial prospects of these parts. He expressed the opinion ""that in all the wide range of tropical Africa there is no more promising field for commerce than this semi-civilized region which forms the central area of the Niger basin."" He came to this conclusion not on the ground that it is more fertile or more rich in natural productions—though in those respects comparing favourably with other parts—but for other reasons. These may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) It is more densely populated than any other part of Africa, and divided into powerful and, in Africa, exceedingly well-governed empires, in which life and property are almost as sacred as in Great Britain. (2) The peoples are far advanced in civilization, and throughout Northern Africa are famed for the excellences of their various manufactures. (3) The necessary machinery and organization to work the inland trade is ready to hand, as the Houssa trader is famed for his commercial genius and enterprising spirit. (4) An efficient transport service already exists, as the horse, camel, bullock, and donkey flourish in their thousands. (5) Owing to the much sterner conditions under which the people live, labourers are to be found without stint. (6) The River Niger presents an uninterrupted waterway into the very heart of this region. (7) The country, for Africa, is eminently healthy, especially away from the immediate neighbourhood of the rivers. While thus presenting such a favourable view of the prospects of the Central Soudan, the author was careful to warn people that African trade is not to be developed with a sudden rush, but as the results of forethought and careful plodding.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Roll of African Worthies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our heart swells with exultation whenever we are able to point to a name to be inscribed on the historical roll of African worthies.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Thomson agrees with Dr. Blyden as to the causes of these astonishing results.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': ""In East and Central Africa, by as late as 1850 only a single society, the Church Missionary Society, was operating.

In the main, evangelization took the form of American black missionaries working, first, in the service of mainstream, predominantly white denominations. For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

They were movements which were emancipatory in character, expressing what is essentially a universal phenomenon in situations in which communities had to express their dissatisfaction with their living conditions and a desire for regeneration. They represented an ideology competing against colonial› ism in so far as the latter represented a negation of indigenous culture and economic, social and psychological depression of the colonized. In the words of Lanternari, 'They reflect the anxieties and hopes of the groups that participate in them for a sudden and total transformation of their physical, social and psychological environment.' 16 Prominent examples of such movements in our period, some of whose activities have been discussed in Chapter 20 above, were Ethiopianism in South and East Africa, and the movement spearheaded by millenarian preachers in Southern and Central Africa, notably the Kitawala (African and Congo Watch Tower) with large following in the Rhodesias, spreading to the Congo (now Zaire) and Nyasaland (now Malawi); the Kimbanguist movement (founded in the Belgian Congo by Simon Kimbangu) with following in Belgian and French Congo and the neo-Kimbanguist Mission des Noirs founded in the Lower Congo by Simon-Pierre Mpadi. Otherwise known as the Khakists, the movement had influence among the population of French Congo and Oubangui-Chari (now Central African Republic). Some of these movements were inspired by their acceptance of Christianity but were disenchanted with the expression of the religion in the organized Church of the colonial societies. African nationalists who were anxious to preserve Africans against colonial oppression found the Church at best indifferent. They therefore broke away very much in the spirit of the Reformation which has been characteristic of the growth and spread of Christianity in many societies.

The right honourable gentleman and yourself may not fully comprehend the meaning of this important point in the memorial, and be led to inquire what are the good effects which have been produced by those societies. I will explain. Between 1837 and 1841 the sitting magistrates at the Gambia were wearied with one complaint and one plea throughout the rainy seasons, when business is half closed, and no employment can be found for the lower class of workmen, such as labourers, &c. These men must live, and when they could not obtain their living honestly, they procured it by dishonesty, going about stealing from the merchants\' stores, &c., and when taken before the magistrates they pleaded not guilty, giving as their poor, groundless reason, ""that they were in want, and, having nothing to live upon, as there was no work to do in the rains, and no merchant willing to give them credit, they were obliged to rob."" The magistrates then saw the real wants of the people, and consulted a Wesleyan missionary (now in England) to see if he could manage some means of restraining those lawless characters. The rev. gentleman then called on one of his local brethren to see what could be done. They concluded to form a ""Workmen\'s Club"" for assisting each other throughout the rains. The local brother mustered the whole of his tribe and explained to them in their own language the shame and disgrace some had brought on themselves, &c. He then showed them the necessity for a Workmen\'s Club, for assisting each other in time of need. The proposal was unanimously voted; and thus the first Eboe society started in the year 1842. It consisted of both males and females, and up to this day a male member pays 1s., and a female 6d. per month. At the close of every meeting the members were warned to be honest, and informed that should they require any necessary assistance the club will be ready to meet their wants. In the course of two years the practices complained of were totally forgotten. People became honest and respectful, other tribes following their example, until all the various tribes in the Gambia formed themselves into similar societies with similar objects. It succeeded so well that the magistrates and merchants returned their thanks to the rev. gentleman for his kind suggestion to the people. The people are also, to this day, grateful to him and to his local brother, their own countryman, whose son is now in London, sent by his countrymen to study for their further welfare.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-12-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1865#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns.

The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life.

Henry Johnson, the African clergyman, who has but recently returned to this country from England, where he has been under the kind tuition of your Society, is by birth a Yoruba, descended from parents who are of the Yoruba nation; and as there is an extensive field for clergymen in these countries, he will be a most useful person in these parts if your Society will permit him to be sent to this country.\n\nBesides this, there is another strong reason why we now address your Committee on this subject, and that is, your Committee have already established in Lagos an educational institution for the training of young men, superintended by a European clergyman; who, from the effects of this climate, is very often prostrate with illness, and deterred from carrying on his work for any length of time before he is again laid up; and although this gentleman has been a very active person, and willing to do, and has been doing, his utmost in the performance of his responsible duty, yet constant prostration from illness must weaken his energies to a great extent, and has obliged him to return to England for a change, for the benefit of his health. This state of things has obliged your Committee to consider the necessity of sending out another clergyman to assist this superintendent; and as a European assistant will and must be subject to the same effects of the climate, and not diminish the difficulties and drawbacks to which the institution is subject from these causes, as these two gentlemen might at times be laid up at the same time, your Committee will agree with us that it is apparent that the appointment of an African clergyman to such a post might not only diminish the disadvantages to which such an important institution is subject, and will always be subject, but will save your Society the constant necessary medical and travelling expenses of a European agent.\n\nUnder these circumstances we trust that your Committee will be pleased to consider the subject, and grant that Mr. Johnson be sent to Lagos, where he can be very useful to his own people. —Awaiting your Committee's kind and favourable reply, we beg, &c.,"", 'last_edit_date': '1872-12-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_12_1872#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""A Liberian's View of the African Problem"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following extracts from a recent letter of the Rev.

I said to some of them: \'You are spending millions of money on a line in which it must be wasted. Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty. The enterprises in East Africa, both of Englishmen and Germans, are only commercial movements, not colonisation, and are not only liable to but will share the fate which has befallen all great European, secular or religious, movements in equatorial Africa. You rightly consider that the agents in the work of Africa\'s regeneration are the civilised and Christianised negroes now in exile. Mahometanism, notwithstanding the sneers of some and the ignorance of others, is doing a wonderful work in Africa, really preserving the people against the unscrupulous proceedings of European traders and adventurers. The Arabs can do no harm, they as readily follow as lead in negro land. Jesus Christ as a religious reformer and as a regenerator of all the races of mankind was right. These organisations, which undertake to represent Him among foreign races, have not yet half understood Him, and He will not endorse work which not only contravenes the spirit but the letter of his teachings. After Europe shall have been purged of the wrongs which it has inflicted upon Africa, and has got rid of the gold unjustly acquired through the blood of the children of the Dark Continent, then it may be given to these would-be-masters of humanity to see the proper course both for their own and Africa\'s weal.""', 'last_edit_date': '1889-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_08_1889#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agencies at Work with Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'AMONG the signs of the times, one not the least remarkable is the variety of active agencies simultaneously at work for redeeming Africa from that filthy sleep of ages in which she has been lying, that sleep which has made her a byeword among the nations, and drawn upon her the reproach and scorn of the civilized world; for in that sleep of barbarism the most horrible dreams have exhibited themselves in action, until men have boldly stated their conviction that the slave-trade, with all its horrors, was a beneficent agent acting upon the degraded mass, calling, at least, some individuals out of it, and into that mental activity and physical refinement which vindicated the humanity of the whole race, by showing that its loathsome slumber was adventitious, and removable by the application of the same means that have been successful in other lands and', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Knowing you to be a friend of humanity, and a lover of mankind, I hasten to lay before you the following matters of fact, to dispose of them as you may think fit in the columns of your all-hailed paper.\n\nI was highly delighted when reading the printed circular of the Parent Committee of the Church Missionary Society, ""On Domestic Slavery in the Yoruba Mission,"" especially their truthful assurance in the latter part of the second paragraph, and their noble and Christian desire in the latter part of the fourth paragraph.

There is much independent testimony to the same effect.

Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

The General History of Africa acknowledges the significant logistical and health challenges faced by missionaries, such as the concentration of medical efforts on Europeans and limited healthcare for Africans, while also noting the substantial impact missionaries had in establishing mission stations and influencing local politics and societies. This suggests a reliance on foreign missionaries, who were often agents of colonialism, paving the way for European intervention. However, the textbook also describes efforts to develop local leadership through the creation of an African class of evangelists and leaders, presenting a more nuanced picture than the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the under-resourced nature of missionary efforts, detailing logistical difficulties like the lack of roads and the high cost of carriers, as well as health challenges that led to high mortality rates among missionaries. The articles highlight the reliance on foreign missionaries, who frequently had to return home due to illness, and suggest that a native ministry might be more sustainable. They also discuss political challenges, such as the need for better relations with local tribes and the impact of colonial rule, and call for the development of local leadership through training native agents and establishing educational institutions. Together, these sources underscore the mixed impact of missionary efforts, the unsustainable reliance on foreign missionaries, and the critical need for better support and development of local leadership in Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook provides a nuanced view of missionary efforts in Africa, which both supports and contrasts with the claim.

Health challenges are also emphasized, with frequent references to missionaries suffering from fever and other illnesses, leading to high mortality rates and the need for many to return home for recovery. The reliance on foreign missionaries is evident, with mentions of European missionaries frequently needing to leave due to health issues, and the suggestion that a native ministry might be more sustainable.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'The missionary factor', 'content': ""Both missionary Christianity and education were also important factors which determined the course and nature of African responses to colonial conquest. The missionaries had created an African class of evangelists, teachers, journalists, businessmen, lawyers and clerks who often seemed to accept the supposed cultural inferiority of the Africans, to accept settler colonialism as a fact of life and who admired the white man for his power, wealth and technology.$^{2}$ Examples of these individuals were Tiyo Soga (1829^71), the first African missionary to be ordained by the United Presbyterian Church in Britain, founder of the Mgwali mission where he preached to both Africans and Europeans, and translator of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress into Xhosa as U-Hambo Lom-Hambi, the first book written by an African to be published by the Lovedale Press, in 1867; John Langalibalele Dube, a Methodist minister, an ardent follower of the black American educationalist, Booker T. Washington, founder-president of the Zulu Christian Industrial School, the Natal Bantu Business League and the first president of the African National Congress; John Tengo Jabavu (1859-1921), a devout Methodist, founder-editor of the English/ Xhosa weekly Imvo Zabantsundu; and Walter Rubusana, a Congregationalist minister and the only African ever elected to the Cape Provincial Council.\nIdeologically, these mission-educated Africans shared the universalism, utopianism and non-racialism of the missionaries and of the Aborigines' Protection Society. They were committed to constitutionalism, gradualism, and cultural assimilation as advocated by a few white liberals among the settlers. But they also were disciples of Booker T. Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic. They generally acquiesced in colonial expansion and conquest, partly because, like the missionaries, they associated colonialism with Christianity and 'civilization', and partly because they respected the 'overwhelming superiority' of European weapons and warfare."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""One of the means by which African-American black interchanges were nurtured in the colonial period, short of mass migrations, was the coming of black missionaries to 'elevate' Africa by Christian evangelism.

For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H.

As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Between 1858 and 1873 the CMS, UMCA and the Holy Ghost Fathers were all involved. The CMS continued to work at Rabai near Mombasa, where freed slaves from Bombay were sent to assist Rebmann. The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies. The impact of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters.

The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like.

Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism. However, the Islamic successor states were themselves ephemeral, for they were victims of the same objective conditions that had already doomed the autonomous development of the African states."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': 'In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans. African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': 'There is no need to exaggerate the role of external forces in African statebuilding. The internal forces were the primary mechanism of political evolution and the existing logics of development account for most of the particular details. Furthermore states were constructed in this same era which were quite remote from the world-economy as, for example, the Rozvi.$^{35}$ Also it is quite obvious, by looking at the West African states, that there is an imperfect connection between participation in the slave-trade and state-formation. If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process.

Few societies that effect any permanent good are grand in their beginnings. Precociousness in them, as in children, is fatal to real power. Fiction alone starts into complete existence; while the realities of life build up gradually the individual and general structures of human history. Error is glittering; nothing is easier than to dazzle and win with it. Truth is the reverse of this; and struggles amid difficulty and hardship into appreciation and favour. Look at our great missionary societies. Consult their early records. The Church Missionary Society was at first very coldly received. During some years its income fluctuated from three or four hundred to a thousand pounds a-year. People who could not, or did not, care to see, or were unable to grasp the great principle of its existence, sneered at it, no doubt. It was doing nothing, of course. No one could perceive any rich fruit of its exertions; and yet it had sown and gathered something in from the first seed—and yet it was from the first moment gradually advancing toward the great harvest of its present utility—and yet it had securely laid the foundation of its present goodly edifice. The germ of its actual vigorous life was swelling amid the cerements of the national apathy, anon to throw out its roots, to raise high its head and spread wide its branches; to fatten and flourish in the rich soil and sunshine of popular wealth and favour, and cast around the precious leaves of Christian truth appointed for the healing of the nations.\n\nIt would justly be thought presumptuous in us to liken the African-Aid Society, now struggling through the diseases and feebleness of infancy, with that veteran society whose efforts have been crowned with much success. But there is no presumption in comparing the actual infancy of the one with the remote infancy of the other. All societies of slow development are subject to the same early maladies. The future alone can determine whether the African-Aid Society will pass safely through those to which it, in common with others, has been subject. But we fearlessly maintain that if actual service performed entitles to success, the African-Aid Society has established its claim.\n\nWhat was and is its self-imposed mission? To grapple with the material evils that oppress and degrade Africa, and its people—to hasten the annihilation of the atrocious slave-trade, which drains the African continent of its life's blood—and to aid and stimulate the development of the industrial resources which God has there so lavished.""}, {'id': 425, 'article_title': 'EASTERN AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'EASTERN AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-11', 'issue_date': '23_08_1864', 'content': 'The breaking up of the Zambezi Mission, and the return of Dr. Livingston to England, are events of so decided a nature as regards the progress of material development and civilization in Eastern Africa, that they cannot be allowed to pass without remark. It is but too common, under analogous circumstances, to declare hastily that all the valuable life sacrificed and the money expended have been sacrificed and expended in vain. Because some immediate advance toward the desired end is not seen as a result of the labour and expenditure, the world gives its verdict of entire failure. Nothing can be more erroneous. Setting aside the fact that there is an issue of some sort or other from every even the most insignificant of human actions, it is incontrovertible that every Christian effort made toward the regeneration of a country long condemned to barbarism, superstition, and unproductiveness, must and does bear fruit. The travels of Dr. Livingston—the efforts made by him against the slave-trade—the labours and sacrifices of the Zambezi Mission—have their permanent place, and were, no doubt, indispensable in the great chain of events connected with the future civilized life of Eastern Africa. As believers in the eventual reclamation of the whole world from the exclusive dominion of evil, which for a time prevents portions of it from fulfilling the Divine mandate and intentions we cannot hold or propagate any other belief. We may, and do deplore, that the results desired when the Zambezi Mission first went out from among us, have not followed immediately from the effort. But, we cannot and we think that no one ought to deplore that the efforts were made. And it is only when a false estimate is taken of them that such feelings can obtain. Regarded as isolated facts, the promptitude with which the Oxford and Cambridge Mission was organised, and the pecuniary support that flooded in, had in them something of grandiose. But to have occupied a permanent place among the Christian and civilizing agencies of the Christian world, that zeal and that liberality should only have been looked upon as the small introductory portions of a vastly larger consecutive movement. The Livingston labours and Zambezi Mission ought to be viewed not alone, but in comparison with the end toward which they were directed. What are two or three thousand a-year from a Government aiding the energy of one ardent man, and 20,000l. with a handful of zealous missionaries, when compared with the deliverance of a quarter of a continent from the cruel tyranny of that evil dominion under which it lies prostrate, bleeding, groaning, shrieking in moral and material agony? What are they? Why, infinitesimal. But, alas! and we write it with the sickness of sorrow and shame, every little effort made for Africa is so magnified in importance in the eyes or mind of the maker or the public, that a most unfair estimate is formed of it, and most unjustifiable expectations are attached to it. With regard to many other portions of the world that have not more than half the claim upon us that may be urged on behalf of Africa, men do give in faith and trust. ""Cast thy bread upon the waters and it shall be found after many days,"" seems at least to be believed in. But when they are solicited to turn their hearts towards Africa, a spasmodic contraction of unchristian selfishness seizes them.

He was welcomed with gladness by the educated Africans here, and soon hired temporary buildings and commenced work in earnest. Such was the appreciation of the institution by the people, that within a few weeks about sixteen young women, who had been considered too much grown up to attend the ordinary day-schools, became daily pupils, and would have become boarders in the institution had there been accommodation in the temporary buildings. Within a few months, however, this reverend gentleman and his wife were both so prostrated by illness that they were recommended to return to England. The institution would, for this cause, have had to be closed up, as the other few missionaries in the place had more than their handsful of their own station duties, had not one of our educated African ladies volunteered to carry on the institution till another, or other agents, could be sent out from England. At the same time the Female Institution was established, a ""Young Men\'s Training Institution"" was also set on foot, under the superintendence and teaching of another most useful clergyman, who took great interest in the education of the young; and in consequence of that gentleman being obliged also to return to England for the benefit of his health, the other clergymen had to overtask and burden themselves with the duties of the institution. It was this, I believe, which led the society to contemplate sending out an assistant, who would carry on the work when the principal might be ill or absent. Upon its being known here that an assistant was to be employed, the educated Africans, and others interested in the education of the young, thought it desirable to petition the Church Missionary Society, and urge upon that worthy body the necessity of employing an African to be the assistant, and so save not only expense, but the health and lives of good men, whereupon the petition (copy of which is sent herewith) was addressed to the Church Missionary Society, which petition was duly posted, and, it is believed, duly reached its destination.'}, {'id': 2380, 'article_title': 'MRS.

A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools. The difficulties to be overcome in this mission have been very great; not the least being the necessity of providing the people with written languages.

Alfred Saker and the Rev. George Grenfell, late missionaries, who were at Akwa Town, address to the Baptist Missionary Society concerning Bell Town and Akwa Town, Cameroons. There are millions and millions of Europeans who have never heard of this country, but still there are many who have heard of it and its towns, but don't know the State and tribes of the Cameroons. Permit me, therefore, to say something about them to you to-day, because God has appointed you as an instrument to check ungodly dealings in Africa. The Cameroons are governed by two kings—King Bell and King Akwa. The people of Bell Town are under King Bell's control, and the people of Akwa Town are under King Akwa's control. Each town has its own laws too. So, under these circumstances, although they are called Cameroons, there are two distinct peoples. I am sorry to say that King Bell and King Akwa often engage in contention, and the disputes lead them into war. Under these distressing circumstances, King Bell has his own European trading vessel on his beach, and King Akwa has his own trading vessel too; so that if war break out between Bell Town and Akwa Town, each people can go in their own hulk, and buy whatever they want without molestation. So it was as regards the missionaries also. The Rev. Quintin Wilson Thomson was the Bell Town Missionary, and the Rev. Alfred Saker was the Akwa Town Missionary. Mr. Saker was a very good man, and was exceedingly kind to Akwa Town and all the people of Cameroons; by which he was pushing the wheel of civilization and Christianity in Akwa Town. But Mr. Thomson did not the same with the people of Bell Town that Mr. Saker did in Akwa Town. He became a young tyrant at Bell Town. I call him a young tyrant, because he was very cruel to the people of Bell Town, both to the members of his church and the worldly men, and even to the African boys that were living with him. ... The poor members of the Church of Bell Town could not bear to be under such a pastor, so they went to Mr. Saker and told him their trouble. Mr. Saker told them that he was very sorry to hear of their trouble, but that he had no means of assisting them, and they must write to the Baptist Missionary Society in London and tell them of the ill-treatment which they daily received from Mr. Thomson. So the poor people wrote to the Committee, and told them of the ill-treatment and the cruelty which they daily received from their sacred teacher, and that they will not have Mr. Thomson for their missionary any more. The poor members of Bell Town Church did not understand how difficult it is for a society to find a missionary to send to Africa, and there was no one to make them understand. At last the Society granted their request, and wrote to Mr. Thomson to remove from Bell Town. When Mr. Thomson was leaving Bell Town, Mr. Saker told them that they must not be afraid; the Society would send out a missionary for them. But it is now seven years since Mr. Thomson left Bell Town, and no missionary has come out instead of him. The members of Bell Town Church are, therefore, in great want of a European missionary, because it is a very sad thing for a Christian people to live without having one to preach the joyful news of Christ to them. And now, whenever the members of Bell Town Church write to the Committee or the Baptist Missionary Society, they answer them that Mr. Grenfell and Mr. Saker told them that Bell Town is near to Akwa Town, so the members of Bell Town Church must attend the divine service at Akwa Town. But I am sorry to say that Mr. Saker and Mr. Grenfell have not taken a right view of the case Bell Town and Akwa Town are two distinct towns; each town has its own laws and king; so, therefore, each town ought to have her own missionary, because when the members of Bell Town go to Akwa Town to worship, if the worldly men of Akwa Town have been to Bell and quarrelled there, and got flogged by the Bell Town people on account of that quarrel, as soon as the poor members of Bell Town Church come out after the service, the Akwa Town people catch these poor people and give them a sound flogging, as a revenge for the flogging they received at Bell Town. I think it is right, therefore, that the poor people should have their own missionary. Unless the Baptist Missionary Society send out a missionary to Bell Town this year, the chiefs of Bell Town and the Church members intend to write to the Primitive Methodist or Presbyterian Church to send some one to Bell Town who will preach the joyful news of Christ to them. The new missionary of Akwa Town, Rev. D. Lyall, is very kind to the members of Bell Town Church. I often hear that the Baptist Missionary Society say that their labours in Cameroons are not progressing, and that it is thirty-three years since they first sent the Gospel in Cameroons, and that it is not progressing. It is thirty-three years now since the Gospel came in Akwa Town, but not to all Cameroons. Mr. Thomson was the first missionary who settled in Bell Town, and he was four years in Bell Town; so it is only four years since the Gospel sound came to the knowledge of Bell Town's people. The Baptist Missionary Society, therefore, think that they are pushing the wheel of civilization and Christianity in all parts of Cameroons. They are only pushing the wheel in Akwa Town, and they must expect fruits of their labour in Akwa Town alone. The Cameroons field is very large, but the labourers are very few.—I am, Sir, yours, &c.,  \nAN EYE-WITNESS.""}, {'id': 4867, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-10', 'issue_date': '01_07_1884', 'content': ""THE LATE EX-PRESIDENT RUSSELL.\n\nEX-PRESIDENT A.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country. Some constitutions acclimatize with difficulty, others never; while some fall victims to fever as soon as they reach their destination, and before commencing work.'}, {'id': 5113, 'article_title': 'MR.

His ideas on the subject till he saw Livingstone were of a legendary character. But then he had recognized what a type of noble, physical, and spiritual manhood a good missionary and a good man could be. Ever since he had, thinking of Livingstone's friendly manner, and the intense earnestness of his language, entertained a high opinion of missionaries. The real work of the missionary was very hard indeed—(hear, hear)—and where lay their reward? How could it possibly pay? The missionary had to teach himself, beginning with the very alphabet, and his education must occupy from six to ten years. Meanwhile, what did the home society give to encourage and cheer him in his task? A few sodden bananas, a pound or two of beans, and a few ears of rice. He was thought to be treated in a princely way if he got a little flour. There was no wine, no whisky, no champagne. (Laughter.) He must drink Congo water, tea, coffee, and cocoa, if the society liked, and that was all. He had with that treatment to think of the society kindly. But if they reflected on what their own thoughts would be of any one who had given them fever, they might realize how unbounded was a missionary's charity to be able constantly to think of his work and of his society kindly. (Laughter, and hear, hear.) It was only after the missionary had educated himself by long years of patient industry that he could hope to convert the natives around him, or even to impress them with a kindly feeling. Then he began the story of hope, the story of his own country and of those who had sent him out. He thought he could write an interesting book of the true story of missionary life in Africa, for he was unprejudiced and unbiased, and though some people thought the contrary, he did not exaggerate. When a missionary had got initiated into native ways, and had learned the language of the tribe sufficiently to be able to benefit, he heard perhaps of another tribe, higher up, of more promising character, and then, if he went to them, he had to go through the same process of studying the new language and trying to obtain the same power over the natives by convincing them of his kindly motives and intentions. Otherwise it was hopeless to expect to implant any interest in black men. He had given them the merest outlines of a picture, of which they could fill in the details themselves, and then they would be able to imagine one of their missionaries at his work in Africa. Touching, then, upon the country, he said that the part about the Congo might not inaptly be thought of as a vast botanical garden or conservatory, but instead of a glass dome there was a burning sky, with a white sun shining through it at a temperature between 80 deg. and 100 deg. For encountering the perils of such a country he feared the society did not inquire of their young missionaries how much judgment, discretion, and good sense they had, though a man ought to be blessed with abundance of good sense to know how to live in the Congo country. They had a solemn duty before them to the young men they were about to send out to the Congo or to Africa, without teaching them how to live wisely, and that duty was as manifest on the society as if it were the young men were their own children to whom they wished long life, for a dead missionary six feet under ground was of no more value than any other dead man. (Hear, hear.) What was the value of dead Gordon on the Nile? Absolutely nothing; but had he lived, the civilization that had received its death-blow in the Soudan would still be in its spring, and they would not have had long to wait to see summer dawning in the interior of Africa. (Cheers.) He would suggest to the society what he had impressed upon the Committee at Brussels—that they should prepare some practical precepts for the every-day conduct of young men going out to Africa. The problem was how, on the breezy mountains and in the deep valleys, with tall grasses waving before the eternal South Atlantic wind, he could preserve himself in health and strength to carry out the work for which he was sent. The great danger to which a novice in Africa was exposed was getting chills from the ever-prevalent South Atlantic wind when bathed in perspiration, by sitting in the coolest spots he could find, bathing in every stream he came across, and drinking immoderately of its water. It was the commonest thing for young men making their way from the mouth of the Congo on first landing to Stanley Pool to over exert themselves, by doing the distance in fourteen or fifteen days, committing all these errors on the way. If they were sufficiently strong to escape without an immediate attack of fever, and to arrive in apparent health, they were attacked when reaction set in, and probably paid the penalty of imprudence with their death. With this state of things he contrasted the spectacle of Livingstone living to his 61st year in the interior of Africa without medicines or stores, living on corn cobs and bananas, and up to the last talking with enthusiasm of the beauties of Africa. In reality, with prudence and the exercise of common sense, the climate of Africa was not half as dangerous as many parts of the Southern United States. He could take that company to a place in the Southern States where they would not be twelve hours before all of them would be down with fever. (Laughter.) Yet at that very place the population since 1860 had doubled, and they would see plenty of beautiful women and children. If women and children could live there with care, what was to prevent the same thing in Africa? The same sort of foolish exposure which in New York carried off young people with pneumonia, knocked down people with fever in Africa; and in both cases it could be avoided by avoiding the sudden chill which did all the mischief. These were little practical details, which they ought to impress on the minds of the young missionaries whom they sent out to Africa. Acknowledging then the receipt of the handsome testimonial, which he explained would have to be consigned to packing cases, which contained sixty or seventy of the same sort, for which, pending his final settlement, he could find no place, he said that though he could not carry the testimonials themselves, he could and did carry the kindly feelings and sentiments by which they had been accompanied. All that he had done for the Baptist missionaries had been done with good-will on his part; but to be honest with them, it was not out of his spontaneous good-will alone, for it was equally in obedience to a command of his Majesty the King of the Belgians. (Applause.) Should he find himself again in a position to do any further service either to the Baptist or to any other missionary society, he should do it with a free heart, and with perfect impartiality to all those labourers whose toil he had seen to be more severe than any his own in the heart of Africa.

The Need of Endowment. We set on foot an Endowment Fund on the twenty-first anniversary of our existence as a Native Church, in 1883. We have raised £250 towards it. One of our Native Church members has given £1,000. Our object in raising an endowment is to set us free to appropriate all we can possibly raise annually to educational and missionary effort. At present our daily supply barely meets our daily need. The sooner our Church members and friends can endow the Pastorate the sooner shall we really be aggressive. It is a vast undertaking to raise enough money to ensure to some fifteen pastors £100 a year, but it must be done. We wish our delegates to press this matter on the minds of those who wish to see us a truly aggressive Church, and we beg our friends to understand that a very false impression exists as to native wealth in West Africa. There are a few wealthy men, comparatively speaking, but they are scattered amongst the many Christian bodies.\n\n(b.) We are resolved to improve the quality of our education, and our delegates will plead for money to enable the Native Church to set on foot a good system of training of schoolmasters. If we are to be a Missionary Church and a light to the darkness around, the training of our children must be taken up in real earnest. At present many grow up untaught, many more with but a surface knowledge, and thus with this most dangerous smattering, go off from us along the coast, miserable and unfair representatives of Sierra Leone Christianity. We profess to speak the English language in this colony, but education has much to do in this particular. (c.) And some of us are concerned further that we as a Church are training no missionaries. We have not the means. We trust that one result of the mission that is to be held will be that we shall have the young men who will gladly volunteer to ""endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ."" We wish to support a missionary who will preach to the heathen also in our streets in their own languages. For these two last stated objects Fourah Bay College (C.M.S.) is at hand and open. The Principal is ready to receive all we can send him, and to train them in both departments. We have also a C.M.S. Grammar School and a female C.M.S. Institution, that are doing their work well; but none of them will have the right material on which to work until the native Church attends more thoroughly to the early and infantile grounding.'}, {'id': 5199, 'article_title': 'What African Missionaries Have to Go Through', 'full_section_title': 'What African Missionaries Have to Go Through', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-12', 'issue_date': '01_09_1885', 'content': 'About six months ago a party of over forty missionaries left the Mersey for St. Paul de Loanda, South-west Africa, in order to conduct their work in that district, and as far as possible into the interior.

According to accounts which from time to time have been received in England, the missionaries have had to undergo terrible hardships, and the latest information shows that those of the party who are alive are in a most deplorable condition. The party, on leaving Liverpool, included men, women, and children, and were evidently totally unacquainted with the nature of the country they were going to. In a very short time after their arrival many of them were stricken down with fever, and soon death terminated the sufferings of several. The missionaries appear to have been ill-provided with funds, and although two or three of the party have returned home, they were only enabled to do so by the consideration of the English steamship companies trading to the port. A gentleman who has been engaged in trading at St. Paul de Loanda for some time past has just arrived in England, and from him some very sad facts have been obtained. So badly off were the party at latest accounts that they had sent a request to the trading houses to be given the leavings of their tables. Many of the party, if they acted on the promptings of their own feelings, would return to America, but they were afraid of being accused of acting in their own interests, and abandoning the noble work they went out to pursue.

It seems that a much larger proportion of the African agents than we were aware of have failed in one way or another, and have either left or been disconnected during the thirty years the mission has been carried on. Most of these have been subordinate teachers, whose very names were unknown to us in England; but some have been ordained men—of which class no less than five had been disconnected prior to the present year. The most serious steps in this respect were recorded in the annual report for 1883-4, in which the fact that the Bishop had admitted some of his men too readily to holy orders was commented on.\n\nJust twelve months ago, the African missionary in charge of the Upper Niger Mission (Archdeacon Henry Johnson) was requested by the Committee to withdraw from Lokoja. He did so forthwith, and has since been at Lagos awaiting further instructions. At the same time, some of the stations that had been reckoned to the Upper Niger were transferred to the Lower Niger Mission, with three ordained Africans who were in charge of them; and two other ordained Africans in the reduced Upper district were sent down to stations in the Delta.

Why so? Because ministerial discord and dissension are at the bottom of it. One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa.

Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country. Some constitutions acclimatize with difficulty, others never; while some fall victims to fever as soon as they reach their destination, and before commencing work.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NATIVE CHURCH OF SIERRA LEONE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Revs. D.

I send with them a clear statement of our purpose, and especially of those circumstances which are making us feel the need of sympathy, help, and encouragement from our brethren in the Mother Church. In venturing to trouble you with a few facts, I am acting as the spokesman of all those principal Church members who assembled at Kissy Road Church, on June 2, to bid our brethren God speed; and I trust the following statement may meet the eye of many friends of Africa.\n\n(1.) This is the scene of the earliest work of the Church Missionary Society. It was led up to by striking providences. It has been costly in human life as well as in money. Not less than half a million, I believe, has been spent here. The outward and visible result is a compact Native Church of some fifteen parishes, not including the cathedral, with a native pastor, parsonage, church and school in each parish.\n\n(2.) This Church, though mainly self-supporting, is still receiving £300 per annum from the C.M.S., which is now being withdrawn at the rate of £50 per annum. We raised last year, for instance, for the Pastorate, _amongst ourselves_, £1,169 18s. 3d class pence alone producing £937 14s. 11d. This is about the average.\n\n(3.) We are a missionary Church. The C.M.S. handed over its missions to the Native Church in 1875. Our Society is called the Sierra Leone Church Missionary Society. We have two missions in the Bullom and in the Quiah country. We have two ordained missionaries with catechists under them. They cost us about £400 per annum. These missions are not making much progress; we scarcely maintain the _status quo_. We can only be said to affirm the principle of the thing. All this thickly populated region, from the far interior to our very border, is practically unevangelized.\n\n(4.) Sierra Leone is only important, financially, as a depot for trade. The Peninsula, though mountainous and fair-looking, is unproductive. A good understanding with the tribes in the interior is all that is wanted to make the Colony prosperous. We have a fine harbour, and are accessible to England, but the place by itself will neither support a Church nor even a Government. And thus I come to the ground of our plea for sympathy and help. Our importance as a Church is that we may be a depot for the interior and around. Heathen and Mahomedans trade with us, settle amongst us, and crowd our streets every day. Nothing is being done for them. Their influence on us is not for good. We are engaged in hand-to-hand intercourse, but not hand-to-hand conflict with their superstitions and sins. The result is enfeebling. We are awakening to feel our need of more spiritual power. We are planning for a general mission next dry season, but we desire to make known other needs only second in importance.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Baptist Mission at the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Until Dr. Underhill returned, the Committee had not the full knowledge they now possess of the amount of suffering and privation which their brethren in Africa have had to bear.

I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship.

Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

It may be regarded as having been formally instituted at a second meeting at Cambridge, on the 1st of November, 1859. The first head of the Mission was Bishop Mackenzie, who established a station at Magomero, on the River Shiri, where a large settlement of slaves, liberated by the Mission party, was formed under the guidance of Dr. Livingstone. The appeal proceeds with a summary of the work that is being done by the Mission at the present time. 1. On the site of the old slave market at Zanzibar, purchased by the liberality of the Rev. A. N. West, of Pembroke College, who died whilst in sole charge of the Mission, Christmas-day, 1874, a fine church which is far advanced towards completion. Adjoining it the Bishop hopes soon to erect houses for the clergy and mission workers, schools, and a hospital. 2. At Mbweni, four miles from Zanzibar, a settlement of adult liberated slaves has been formed, and attached to this station is a girls’ school. 3. At Kiungani, two miles from Zanzibar, is a large boys’ industrial school, which is partly self-supporting. Much of the carpenter’s and other work for the fabric of the Zanzibar church has been done here. 4. A house in Zanzibar was opened as a hospital on Dec. 12, 1875, upon the arrival of Miss Allen and two nurses. It has already done excellent service. 5. Magila, the Mission station on the mainland, is in charge of the Rev. J. P. Farler and Mr. Moss, and has lately been reinforced by Mr. Clarke; the reports are favourable. Bishop Steere has just returned to Zanzibar after five months’ absence on an expedition to the Nyassa country. The details of this interesting journey, begun from Linoi (a point some distance south of Zanzibar, and the nearest part of the coast to Lake Nyassa), at the end of last October, and completed Jan. 21, 1876, will be found in a pamphlet printed at Zanzibar, and now issued under the title of “A Walk to the Nyassa Country.” This suggests the feasibility of extending the operations of the Mission over 300 miles or upwards on the mainland in the direction of the country first occupied under Bishop Mackenzie towards Lake Nyassa. It also affords convincing evidence of the existence still of the slave-trade in the number of caravans which were met. It reveals likewise, incidentally, the self-devotion and perseverance of the Bishop, who when the European members of his party failed him through ill health, started on the journey with native bearers only. The Bishop estimates that by this means some 10,000 slaves were conveyed to the coast. By God’s providence the journey was, notwithstanding difficulties and privations, accomplished safely. In a letter recently addressed by Bishop Steere to the members of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, he says: “I have just returned from a walk of some 700 miles, through almost unknown country, undertaken in your name and for your honour. I have agreed with the greatest of the native chiefs (Mataka) near the Lake Nyassa for a site and for countenance in our mission. I find that my appeal for personal help is being nobly responded to. We paid during the year 20 outward passages. I hear of four more, perhaps now on their way, and of others pressing to follow them. . . . There remain 14 of us, mostly young students, out of whom I feel no doubt the most efficient missionaries will ultimately be formed. Not one of my helpers is desiring money profit from his work.

Afterwards they went to Suakin, where they took camels and went to Berber. From there they proceeded to Khartoum by steamer. In that place they stayed for four days. They then took the steamer for Sardo—a journey of twenty-five days ordinarily, but they occupied sixty-eight, owing to the immense masses of vegetation. The country between Khartoum and Sardo is very unhealthy, fever being the most dangerous illness. From Sardo they passed to Beden. The river is navigable to that point. Falls then begin. From Beden they went to Kerri, and from Kerri to Rigaf, travelling from Rigaf to Labore, from Labore to Mugi, and from Mugi to Dufli. At Dufli they took a steamer, the Nyanza, and proceeded to Magungo, on the Albert Lake, and in the country of Ungoro. Thence they went to Keroto, and so to Kisuna and Foweira. At Foweira they took native canoes belonging to Rionga, the chief of the country, and went by the River Nile to Mrooli, the last Egyptian station. They received much assistance from Colonel Gordon, the Governor-General of the Soudan, through whose kindness they were enabled to reach Mrooli. From Mrooli they set off for Uganda with an escort of Waganda sent by M'tesa, reaching Rubaga, the capital, on February 14, 1879. Mr. Litchfield remained until April, 1880, when he left through ill-health. Mr. Pearson remained until April, 1881, rejoining Mr. Litchfield at Kagei, a missionary station at the south-west end of the lake. Fever compelled both of them to leave, and passing through the countries of Usukuma, Unyamuezi, Ugogo, and Usagara, they reached Saadari towards the end of September, 1881, and Zanzibar a few days later. Mr. Litchfield is still suffering from fever, but hopes shortly to start for England. Mr. Pearson showed me several jewels worn by the women of the country, and some war instruments.

Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

However, from about the last decade of that century and especially during the first five decades of the nineteenth century, the situation underwent a revolutionary change. Primarily because of the evangelical revival in Europe associated with John Wesley, and the anti-slavery and humanitarian spirit of the age, born out of radical philosophies typified by the American and French revolutions, the attempt to plant and spread Christianity assumed the same dynamic if not militant form that characterized Islamic expansion in the Western Sudan. Here, initially, instead of the Ku'ran and the Sword, the Bible, the plough and commerce were the means resorted to, and the active agents were not djikâd leaders, clerics and their flag-bearers but a host of missionary societies, formed and based in Europe and America, and their African agents in Africa. Thus, whereas by 1800 there were only three missionary societies operating in the whole of West Africa, namely, the Society for the Propa› gation of the Gospel (SPG), the Wesleyan Missionary Society (WMS) and the Glasgow and Scottish Missionary Society, by 1840 only four decades later, there were more than fifteen such societies at work.

The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies. The impact of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work. As a result, the Scottish Free Church plunged for the first time into missionary work in Central Africa.

The push into the hinterland was made possible by the geographical explorations which greatly increased European knowledge of the interior of Africa. Besides, great inspiration was derived by many missionaries from the exploration and ideas of David Livingstone, who made the results of his expeditions known through his prolific writings. His view that missionaries should establish centres of Christianity and civilization which would not only promote religion but also commerce and agriculture, came to be widely shared by many enthusiastic missionaries who penetrated far into the interior of Africa, following the old trade routes.

Recent work has, however, emphasized that they were 'frequently employed as negotiators between colonial and African authorities, as diplomats rather than evangelists', and that though the colonists regarded them as danger› ously pro-African, many African leaders (with greater justification) regarded them as dangerously pro-settler and pro-imperialist. 13 These missionary societies did not restrict their activities to building churches, winning converts and translating the Bible into African langu› ages.

For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley.

Learning belonged to the people who attended the missions, and the advantages that came from taking part made them into a privileged class. But they conformed to a pattern already familiar to the local chiefs, not all of whom approved. Some, however, paraded a superficial Westernization in their dress, their homes, their food and drink and their way of life.

The spread of civilization would be an incidental by-product which the palm-oil trade, limited to coastal transactions, could not achieve on its own. 47 Thus the Protestant missions, very much of this world, took on the role of reformers, which included interfering in political and military strategy. The Abeokuta missionaries suggested to England the making of a road to the sea, in order to speed up the barter trade - and the delivery of war material. They invoked the technical help of British troops against Dahomey. At Calabar their influence in the city-states secured by agree› ment the ending of local customs that they considered objectionable. From their position of strength, the missions did not object to the rival intrusion of Western administrations, but counterbalanced it by siding with or against the established trade. Around 1850 the missions, together with the traders and the political administration, became involved in an irreversible process leading to an early form of colonial rule. The appointment of consuls with expansionist views went hand in hand with armed blockades and the establishment of protectorates.

We shall do all that lies in our power to aid the mission, as well as our enterprising colonial brethren in Natal, in obtaining the release of East Africa from the slave-trade depopulating and debasing thraldom in which it is held, through the claims of Portugal, upon a long line of coast, including the embouchure of the principal rivers.\n\nMeanwhile, we hope it will not be deemed impertinent in us by the distinguished men at the head of the Central African Mission to remind them there are other entrances into Central Africa than those from the East Coast. Why not strike at the interior of Africa from both sides of the continent at once? A secure and most important access is to open them from the West Coast. Rabba, on the River Niger, which will, in some way or other, soon be opened to organised commercial enterprise, is the western outpost of the great Mohammedan error in Central Africa. An able, earnest, prudent, active bishop at Rabba might lay the foundation of a Christian influence that would spread throughout Central Africa, and overthrow that dominant mixture of Mohammedanism and heathenism which now prevails. We feel certain that within no very long period a Bishop of Rabba might be followed by a Bishop of Kano. This is a work too important to be longer neglected, and one that is particularly suited to the ecclesiastical organization of the Oxford and Cambridge Mission. Its efforts in this direction touch us nearly.\n\n[MAY 23, 1863.\n\nwould rest upon the influential basis of British presence and occupation, at Lagos only 180 miles from Rabba, and at the British establishments that must soon permanently occupy the Niger. Intelligence would come to England by every monthly mail, and the zeal and interest of the supporters of the mission would thus be kept alive. We must, with all deference, beg leave to submit that only by such an action from the west, as well as up the Zambesi from the east, can it have a just claim to retain its present title of Central African Mission. If it confine itself to the Zambesi effort, the East African Mission will be its most fitting designation. In our earnest anxiety for the civilization of Africa throughout, we cannot conceal our conviction of the widespread benefits that may result from an immediate action in the direction we now presume to suggest and recommend.'}, {'id': 638, 'article_title': 'Missionary Replies to Burton, Reade, and Others', 'full_section_title': 'Missionary Replies to Burton, Reade, and Others', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_06_1865', 'content': 'It was impossible that the annual missionary meetings should pass over without some notice being taken of the systematic attacks made on Christian missions and missionaries at the Anthropological Society. At the Wesleyan meeting, held in Exeter Hall, several speakers alluded to the subject; but it was in especial brought prominently forward by the Rev. John Bedford, of Manchester, and the Rev. W. M. Punshon. In his defence of the cause of Christian missions the former observed: ""In this cause there is a grandeur that should command our admiration; there is a benevolence altogether in harmony with our Christian feelings and sympathies; and there is a certainty of success, no matter what men may say to the contrary, which should strengthen our faith and stimulate our zeal. While our grand object is the conversion of the world, while we aim chiefly at this, we shall promote all other things that are desirable in connexion with it. We shall promote, for instance, all that is desirable in the extension of legitimate commerce, in geographical discovery, in ethnological science, in the amity and intercourse of neighbouring and of distant nations, in the mental elevation and domestic dignity of the female sex throughout all lands, in the supremacy of just laws and good government, and in whatever else tends to promote the happiness of individuals, the peace of families, the well-being of nations, and the repose of the world."" Mr. Bedford went on to show that the attacks alluded to were not only against Christian missions, but against Christianity itself—against Divine revelation. ""The Gospel claims universal supremacy; the Gospel sets forth a Saviour for all men; the Gospel gives commission to all its ministers to go into all the world, and preach to every creature; and if there be the slightest degree of truth in what these men say, that Christianity is not fitted for the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa, then the issue that is joined is an issue between Divine revelation and Mohammedanism, or some other system which any class of men may see fit to set forward and advocate."" He showed that, apart from Christianity, no remedy for the woes of the human family had been found. ""The philosophers of Greece and Rome, when those countries were in the height of their civilization and refinement, did nothing to heal the moral maladies that abounded in their day. Where science flourished, and art created its noblest monuments, where curious books, and beautiful paintings, and noble statuary, and the finest architecture, proclaimed the cultivation of the intellect and the triumphs of genius, there idolatry as gross in principle, though not as rude in form, as that of savages, and obscenity as vile as ever disgraced human nature, went hand in hand unchecked—nay, encouraged and triumphant. ... And so in modern times, all the nostrums which men have proposed in order to cure the moral evils of society have been utterly unavailing; and even all the secondary measures, not nostrums, which they have laid before us, have failed to accomplish the main thing. As to secondary measures, men may talk as long as they please about curing the evils of society by education, by social improvement, by political theories and arrangements, by legislative measures, and by a variety of other things which are valuable and useful in their own way; but none of these things possesses a principle powerful enough to go down to the secret depths of man\'s soul, and carry a transforming power throughout his passions and his nature."" Mr. Bedford expressed that just confidence in the ultimate result which every Christian ought to feel, though opposed in the arduous and difficult work ""by Pagan darkness, by Mohammedan delusion, by Popish superstition, by Jewish infidelity, by lukewarm Christians, and by men who hate Christianity altogether; as well as by almost every form of natural, political, and moral evil."" And success had attended their efforts—great success if measured by a proper standard; but that success ought not to be ""measured by the standard of a nation like this, which has been growing in civilization and Christianity, growing in a Christian civilization, let me rather say, for more than a thousand years? Do we presume to measure the natives of Equatorial Africa, in every point of view with ourselves in this land? Is that a fair test? Can we expect that men who a few years ago were degraded, many of them enslaved in their bodies and enslaved in their minds, can rise up in so brief a period to all the dignity and nobility of the Christian civilization of this land? ... And supposing it were true, to put the case at the worst, that these same travellers who think Mohammedanism and the Koran better for the poor African than our Bible, had found here and there a case of failure; is that a fair way of testing Christian Missions? I submit it is not. I submit, the fair way is to contrast the state of the individuals and the tribes referred to, before they ever had Christian missions among them, with their state and condition now. Have they risen to any degree of civilization? Have they risen and improved in regard to domestic life? Do they respect the conjugal relationship to any larger extent? I am not asking whether there may not be an exception here and there. You must look for these exceptions. You must look for them in the most civilized portions of the world.""'}, {'id': 2833, 'article_title': 'The East African Slave Trade', 'full_section_title': 'The East African Slave Trade', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_11_1874#article-12', 'issue_date': '30_11_1874', 'content': 'A meeting of the Central African Mission, as bearing on the East African slave trade, was held recently at the Mansion House; Sir Bartle Frere presiding, in the unavoidable absence of the Lord Mayor, who was detained in the Justice-room.\n\nThe Right Rev.

The Daily Telegraph of the 24th inst. contained a letter of Mr. Stanley's, occupying eight columns, in which he gives a lively and most interesting account of his ascent of the River Rufiji, which flows through ten mouths into the ocean. Our space is already too much occupied this month to permit our doing justice to this letter, which proves how little we have hitherto known of the navigable waters of Eastern Africa, and of the facilities which water communication with the far interior, offer to a future commerce; in presence of which, that accursed depopulator of vast regions, the slave trade carried on by Arabs for the supply of Persia and other Mahometan countries, will be no longer possible. Should the life of Mr. Stanley be spared, which we most devoutly hope it may be, it may confidently be expected that he will not only perfect the unfinished discoveries of Dr. Livingstone, but give us such a knowledge of Eastern Africa generally as must lead to great results, both as regards commerce and the spread of Christian civilization. The facilities which so fine a navigable river as the Rufiji affords for missionary enterprise are so much greater than any that have been previously known to exist in Eastern Africa, that we look with confident expectation to our Missionary Societies to avail themselves of them for spreading the tidings of the Gospel of eternal life among the multitudes who are there perishing for lack of knowledge.""}, {'id': 5113, 'article_title': 'MR.

The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life.

It may be regarded as having been formally instituted at a second meeting at Cambridge, on the 1st of November, 1859. The first head of the Mission was Bishop Mackenzie, who established a station at Magomero, on the River Shiri, where a large settlement of slaves, liberated by the Mission party, was formed under the guidance of Dr. Livingstone. The appeal proceeds with a summary of the work that is being done by the Mission at the present time. 1. On the site of the old slave market at Zanzibar, purchased by the liberality of the Rev. A. N. West, of Pembroke College, who died whilst in sole charge of the Mission, Christmas-day, 1874, a fine church which is far advanced towards completion. Adjoining it the Bishop hopes soon to erect houses for the clergy and mission workers, schools, and a hospital. 2. At Mbweni, four miles from Zanzibar, a settlement of adult liberated slaves has been formed, and attached to this station is a girls’ school. 3. At Kiungani, two miles from Zanzibar, is a large boys’ industrial school, which is partly self-supporting. Much of the carpenter’s and other work for the fabric of the Zanzibar church has been done here. 4. A house in Zanzibar was opened as a hospital on Dec. 12, 1875, upon the arrival of Miss Allen and two nurses. It has already done excellent service. 5. Magila, the Mission station on the mainland, is in charge of the Rev. J. P. Farler and Mr. Moss, and has lately been reinforced by Mr. Clarke; the reports are favourable. Bishop Steere has just returned to Zanzibar after five months’ absence on an expedition to the Nyassa country. The details of this interesting journey, begun from Linoi (a point some distance south of Zanzibar, and the nearest part of the coast to Lake Nyassa), at the end of last October, and completed Jan. 21, 1876, will be found in a pamphlet printed at Zanzibar, and now issued under the title of “A Walk to the Nyassa Country.” This suggests the feasibility of extending the operations of the Mission over 300 miles or upwards on the mainland in the direction of the country first occupied under Bishop Mackenzie towards Lake Nyassa. It also affords convincing evidence of the existence still of the slave-trade in the number of caravans which were met. It reveals likewise, incidentally, the self-devotion and perseverance of the Bishop, who when the European members of his party failed him through ill health, started on the journey with native bearers only. The Bishop estimates that by this means some 10,000 slaves were conveyed to the coast. By God’s providence the journey was, notwithstanding difficulties and privations, accomplished safely. In a letter recently addressed by Bishop Steere to the members of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, he says: “I have just returned from a walk of some 700 miles, through almost unknown country, undertaken in your name and for your honour. I have agreed with the greatest of the native chiefs (Mataka) near the Lake Nyassa for a site and for countenance in our mission. I find that my appeal for personal help is being nobly responded to. We paid during the year 20 outward passages. I hear of four more, perhaps now on their way, and of others pressing to follow them. . . . There remain 14 of us, mostly young students, out of whom I feel no doubt the most efficient missionaries will ultimately be formed. Not one of my helpers is desiring money profit from his work.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support? Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CHRISTIAN MISSIONS IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The amount and significance of those facts are the essential points. Mr. Farler cannot be blamed for carrying the war into Dr. Lenz's own territory. Travellers are the favourites of the period; and in no career are the prizes more abundant and brilliant. All the world admires the traveller. The missionary, whom few admire, and certainly not the general public, may think it hard that a casual visitor, whom probably he has aided and befriended, should be listened to as if he were Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools when he informs Europe that African missionaries are worthy people who do a great deal of harm. An Englishman who exiles himself to Central Africa enjoys few of the compensations within the reach of the African traveller. He suffers a hundredfold the privations, and he has to wrestle with a barbarism which may be perverted into something worse by undigested education and proselytism. It would not have been surprising had an African missionary, who has resigned the advantages of civilization and attractive prospects in his own land, infused some bitterness into his retort to a rather too magisterial condemnation of his whole object in life. But the real question remains, whether the charge be true, whoever brings it. The opinion of most who examine the evidence will probably be that any large _dictum_ to the purport that missionary work in Central Africa is all illusory is a gross exaggeration. From unimpeachable testimony it is clear that missionary settlements in the country are bearing fruit, whether much or little. Negroes are actually redeemed from debasing sensuality, superstition, and indolence. There are missionary villages in Central Africa which would compare favourably with many English hamlets. The picture Mr. Farler draws of his own station is corroborated by a body of independent testimony, and it demonstrates the accomplishment of marvellous results in a dozen years. Attention there is fully paid to the primary duty of teaching the native the virtue of regular industry, which he had unlearnt through the excessive complaisance of nature. So long as the effort is sustained there can be little doubt that the beneficial effects will go on, and that the individuals subjected to this process will lapse no oftener than professing Christians in Europe and America.\n\nThere seems to be no ground for questioning the soundness of the influence of British Protestant Missions, so far as its scope extends.

Perfectly true, he said, because there was no bright one as seen in the bird's-eye view he had been taking. What was a missionary here and there compared with the thousand agents of commerce who, with untiring and unscrupulous industry, dispensed wholesale the deadly products of Europe? What was a Bible or a bale of useful goods in opposition to the myriad cases of gin—the thousand guns which competed with them? What chance had a Christian virtue where the soil was so suitable for European vice? But he would be presenting to them an entirely misleading picture of the situation if he restricted himself to the distant and general prospect. A closer and more detailed examination revealed many bright points in the night-like darkness of Africa; and of these none scintillated with a more promising light than the enterprises of the Christian missionary. And yet, however promising for the future, when they looked around and saw with what rapid strides the emissaries of Islam had made their influence felt throughout the whole of the Central and Western Soudan, and left the mental and spiritual impress of their civilisation upon the natives, they could not but sadly wonder at the comparatively small headway that their Christian rivals had made against the sodden mass of heathendom. As compared with the good work of Mohammedanism in Africa, Christianity in these lands had been practically a failure. Wherever Mohammedan seed had been planted there it had taken root, and there it had remained to flourish with a vigorous grip of the soil which nothing could destroy. The same could not be said of Christian seed. It had ever been as a delicate exotic, difficult to plant, more difficult to rear, and ever needing outside support and watering. The Mohammedan missionaries had been men like the natives themselves, men who spoke the same language, lived the same life. On the other hand, the Christian worker had accomplished so little because he had tried to do so much. He had seldom comprehended the problems he had had to face. His education has rarely been adapted to the work before him, and filled with much enthusiasm and ardour and more erroneous ideas, he had gone forth too often to do little more than throw away his life with but small result to the cause he had at heart. Before any great advance would be made in the Christian propaganda in Africa a total revolution in the methods of work must be accomplished. Once the negro was attacked in the right spirit, and with a suitable choice of weapons from the Christian armoury, he ventured to predict even more splendid results to Christianity than had ever marked the progress of Islam."", 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE MISSIONARY WORK OF THE BAPTIST MISSIONARY SOCIETY IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our missions in Africa date farther back than is commonly supposed. We find a minute of the proceedings of the Society, dated April 7, 1795, to the following effect: ""Inquiries having been made whether there be any farther openings in the heathen world encouraging to attempt the spreading of the kingdom of Christ in it, it appears to us from the Sierra Leone reports, lately published, that such favourable appearances do exist in Africa as deserve our immediate attention."" A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools.

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Thomson agrees with Dr. Blyden as to the causes of these astonishing results. The spectacle of the earnestness, poverty, and simplicity of the Moslem missionaries has a powerful effect on the minds of the negroes, while the greed and the evil lives of Europeans go far to neutralize any good results that may accrue from the teaching of Christianity. Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual."" And Mr. Thomson\'s evidence is to much the same effect.\n\nSouth of the Equator the Arabs are Mohammedans only in name, and there the slave trade is a fatal obstacle to all improvement. Indeed, it would seem that Islam fails to exert that power over any of the races of the great Bantu family which it exercises over the true negroes of the Soudan. Here, among the higher Bantu tribes south of the Congo, seems to be the region where Christian effort seems most likely to be crowned with success. The efforts of Moffat and Livingstone among the Bechuanas show how readily they embrace and retain the teaching of Christianity.

There is much independent testimony to the same effect. Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures.

Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time.

Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Much of this labour movement in the third of a century after 1880 was accompanied by appallingly high mortality.

The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""Another group of White Fathers left Tabora and went westwards to set up a mission station at Ujiji in 1879 and from there to Rumonge in Burundi, some 120km south of the present Bujumbura, but the station was abandoned in 1881 after the massacre of three missionaries there.

The first was the Livingstonia Central African Trading Company, which was associated with Scottish missionary activities in the Lake Nyasa region.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Neither the desert dwellers nor the highlanders could take much time off from their orchard farming and stock-rearing; and this allowed the invader to launch real economic warfare against them. During the Adrar campaign in 1909 the French soldiers occupied the oases at the time of the date harvest and waited for the men to be compelled by hunger to come and surrender (admittedly not for long). In areas where seasonal migration with stock took place, they closed off the winter pastures and relied on cold and hunger to bring the inhabitants to terms.

Only four of those promised by Senhor Nunez arrived, and the party hired two more, in which they made their way to Mazar, where they learned that famine had almost destroyed the nations on the Shire up to the mission. Bishop Tozer, hearing that the banks of the Shire were in the hands of Mariano, determined to send on the canoe laden with food which had been found at Mazar, then himself to go with the Rev. C. A. Alington in his whaleboat to the station, and, finally, to visit the Morumbala, for the purpose of reporting on its fitness for a mission-station. The members of the mission report themselves in excellent health."" Dr. Livingstone also is failing in health, and everything seems to presage the necessity of transferring the field of operation in Africa to that part of Central Africa that may be reached from the West Coast, via the River Niger, and the Rabba, &c., where monthly communication could be had with the mission. Dr. Livingstone, writing to Sir R. Murchison, announces the death of a distinguished young geologist, Mr. Richard Thornton: ""Murchison Cataracts (on the Shire), April 23.—With sorrow I communicate the sad intelligence that Mr. Richard Thornton died on the 21st current. He performed a most fatiguing journey from this to Tette and back again, and that seemed to use up all his strength; for, thereafter, he could make no exertion without painful exhaustion. His object was to connect his bearings of the hills at Tette (on the Zambesi) with the mountains here. I knew nothing of his resolution till after he had left. He had resolved to go home after he had examined Zomba and the Melanje range, but on the 11th he was troubled with diarrhoea, which ran on to dysentery and fever. We hoped to the last that his youth and unimpaired constitution would carry him through, as he had suffered comparatively little from fever; but we were disappointed. An insidious delirium prevented us learning aught of his last wishes. All his papers, &c., were at once sealed up, and are sent home to his brother at Bradford. He is buried about 500 yards from the foot of the first cataract, and on the right bank of the Shire."" After alluding to the depopulation of the valley, and the probability of his being obliged to take to pieces the steamer, and screw her together, with the view of a sale, Dr. Livingstone thus concludes: ""Dr. Kirk and Mr. Charles Livingstone now go home. The scene of desolation around its reacts on my health badly.'}, {'id': 1643, 'article_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'full_section_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'last_edit_date': '07-28-1869', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'issue_date': '23_09_1869', 'content': ""Sir,—You will at once perceive that this communication is dated at a place concerning which very little or nothing has ever been inserted in your journal.

John Clarke and Dr. Prince, sent out, under the auspices of the Baptist Missionary Society, as pioneers of the subsequently-established mission in these parts. Not many years had elapsed from the time of their arrival before they had succeeded in establishing mission stations both on the island and on the continent, one at Bimbia, about 1844, and another up the Cameroons river about 1846. Three years after the arrival of the first missionaries in Fernando Po, the small missionary band, having by that time increased to about four or five, was considerably augmented and strengthened. On February 16, 1844, a band of missionaries and teachers from Jamaica arrived at Clarence Core in the Chilmark. This noble band, including women and children, consisted of about forty-three persons, the greater number of whom were either black or coloured persons. These were all dispersed and located as was seen necessary. Printing-presses were had out, translations were begun, and the presses set to work. A missionary iron schooner, commanded by a missionary captain, was sent out and placed at the disposal of the missionaries to facilitate evangelical operations, by enabling them to visit the different places that lie along the coast, and thus maintain an unbroken line of communication between the island and the continent. Schools were established, churches formed, and the stations, Clarence especially (which was then the head-quarters), and Bimbia, flourished most wonderfully, and hopes of a very bright future were cherished, but these hopes were, as it were, nipped in the bud. Not that there was a lack of zeal and energy on the part of the workers, for each one, both white and black, did his part most willingly and faithfully. But death, discord, and necessity gradually weakened that strong band, until at the last it was shattered into fragments. Africa is a fatal place for whites. Several of the white missionaries died; one or two of them, owing to discord, felt it necessary to return home and labour somewhere else. As to the blacks, the most numerous body, a few died in Africa, whilst necessity compelled the rest to return to Jamaica. These are reminiscences of the past. Now for the present.""}, {'id': 1643, 'article_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'full_section_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'last_edit_date': '07-28-1869', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'issue_date': '23_09_1869', 'content': 'in the printing-office are not recognized by the other missionaries, excepting the one under whose direction he labours. Why so? Because ministerial discord and dissension are at the bottom of it. One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.'}, {'id': 1831, 'article_title': 'The Baptist Mission at the Cameroons', 'full_section_title': 'The Baptist Mission at the Cameroons', 'last_edit_date': '05-23-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1870#article-25', 'issue_date': '23_05_1870', 'content': '""Doubtless some mistakes have been made, as was inevitable through the novelty of the circumstances.

But it must be remembered that Mr. Saker found nothing to his hand; he had to plan, to conceive, to construct everything, with few or no resources on the spot. After the fullest consideration I could give to these adverse statements, and after inspecting the presumed evidences of this waste, it is my deliberate judgment that, while in some cases the statements have been exaggerations, in others, when the destructive effects of climate are considered—the interruptions occasioned by illness—the thefts of the native population—the slow and inadequate workmanship of the men Mr. Saker has instructed—the delay arising from want of materials to finish the work, and for which resort must be had to the stores and workshops of England—Mr. Saker has done his best, has never wilfully wasted the Society\'s property, and has not been guilty of extravagance. On the contrary, I marvel at the amount of work, both secular and religious, accomplished in the twenty-one years of Mr. Saker\'s toil.

His ideas on the subject till he saw Livingstone were of a legendary character. But then he had recognized what a type of noble, physical, and spiritual manhood a good missionary and a good man could be. Ever since he had, thinking of Livingstone's friendly manner, and the intense earnestness of his language, entertained a high opinion of missionaries. The real work of the missionary was very hard indeed—(hear, hear)—and where lay their reward? How could it possibly pay? The missionary had to teach himself, beginning with the very alphabet, and his education must occupy from six to ten years. Meanwhile, what did the home society give to encourage and cheer him in his task? A few sodden bananas, a pound or two of beans, and a few ears of rice. He was thought to be treated in a princely way if he got a little flour. There was no wine, no whisky, no champagne. (Laughter.) He must drink Congo water, tea, coffee, and cocoa, if the society liked, and that was all. He had with that treatment to think of the society kindly. But if they reflected on what their own thoughts would be of any one who had given them fever, they might realize how unbounded was a missionary's charity to be able constantly to think of his work and of his society kindly. (Laughter, and hear, hear.) It was only after the missionary had educated himself by long years of patient industry that he could hope to convert the natives around him, or even to impress them with a kindly feeling. Then he began the story of hope, the story of his own country and of those who had sent him out. He thought he could write an interesting book of the true story of missionary life in Africa, for he was unprejudiced and unbiased, and though some people thought the contrary, he did not exaggerate. When a missionary had got initiated into native ways, and had learned the language of the tribe sufficiently to be able to benefit, he heard perhaps of another tribe, higher up, of more promising character, and then, if he went to them, he had to go through the same process of studying the new language and trying to obtain the same power over the natives by convincing them of his kindly motives and intentions. Otherwise it was hopeless to expect to implant any interest in black men. He had given them the merest outlines of a picture, of which they could fill in the details themselves, and then they would be able to imagine one of their missionaries at his work in Africa. Touching, then, upon the country, he said that the part about the Congo might not inaptly be thought of as a vast botanical garden or conservatory, but instead of a glass dome there was a burning sky, with a white sun shining through it at a temperature between 80 deg. and 100 deg. For encountering the perils of such a country he feared the society did not inquire of their young missionaries how much judgment, discretion, and good sense they had, though a man ought to be blessed with abundance of good sense to know how to live in the Congo country. They had a solemn duty before them to the young men they were about to send out to the Congo or to Africa, without teaching them how to live wisely, and that duty was as manifest on the society as if it were the young men were their own children to whom they wished long life, for a dead missionary six feet under ground was of no more value than any other dead man. (Hear, hear.) What was the value of dead Gordon on the Nile? Absolutely nothing; but had he lived, the civilization that had received its death-blow in the Soudan would still be in its spring, and they would not have had long to wait to see summer dawning in the interior of Africa. (Cheers.) He would suggest to the society what he had impressed upon the Committee at Brussels—that they should prepare some practical precepts for the every-day conduct of young men going out to Africa. The problem was how, on the breezy mountains and in the deep valleys, with tall grasses waving before the eternal South Atlantic wind, he could preserve himself in health and strength to carry out the work for which he was sent. The great danger to which a novice in Africa was exposed was getting chills from the ever-prevalent South Atlantic wind when bathed in perspiration, by sitting in the coolest spots he could find, bathing in every stream he came across, and drinking immoderately of its water. It was the commonest thing for young men making their way from the mouth of the Congo on first landing to Stanley Pool to over exert themselves, by doing the distance in fourteen or fifteen days, committing all these errors on the way. If they were sufficiently strong to escape without an immediate attack of fever, and to arrive in apparent health, they were attacked when reaction set in, and probably paid the penalty of imprudence with their death. With this state of things he contrasted the spectacle of Livingstone living to his 61st year in the interior of Africa without medicines or stores, living on corn cobs and bananas, and up to the last talking with enthusiasm of the beauties of Africa. In reality, with prudence and the exercise of common sense, the climate of Africa was not half as dangerous as many parts of the Southern United States. He could take that company to a place in the Southern States where they would not be twelve hours before all of them would be down with fever. (Laughter.) Yet at that very place the population since 1860 had doubled, and they would see plenty of beautiful women and children. If women and children could live there with care, what was to prevent the same thing in Africa? The same sort of foolish exposure which in New York carried off young people with pneumonia, knocked down people with fever in Africa; and in both cases it could be avoided by avoiding the sudden chill which did all the mischief. These were little practical details, which they ought to impress on the minds of the young missionaries whom they sent out to Africa. Acknowledging then the receipt of the handsome testimonial, which he explained would have to be consigned to packing cases, which contained sixty or seventy of the same sort, for which, pending his final settlement, he could find no place, he said that though he could not carry the testimonials themselves, he could and did carry the kindly feelings and sentiments by which they had been accompanied. All that he had done for the Baptist missionaries had been done with good-will on his part; but to be honest with them, it was not out of his spontaneous good-will alone, for it was equally in obedience to a command of his Majesty the King of the Belgians. (Applause.) Should he find himself again in a position to do any further service either to the Baptist or to any other missionary society, he should do it with a free heart, and with perfect impartiality to all those labourers whose toil he had seen to be more severe than any his own in the heart of Africa.

According to accounts which from time to time have been received in England, the missionaries have had to undergo terrible hardships, and the latest information shows that those of the party who are alive are in a most deplorable condition. The party, on leaving Liverpool, included men, women, and children, and were evidently totally unacquainted with the nature of the country they were going to. In a very short time after their arrival many of them were stricken down with fever, and soon death terminated the sufferings of several. The missionaries appear to have been ill-provided with funds, and although two or three of the party have returned home, they were only enabled to do so by the consideration of the English steamship companies trading to the port. A gentleman who has been engaged in trading at St. Paul de Loanda for some time past has just arrived in England, and from him some very sad facts have been obtained. So badly off were the party at latest accounts that they had sent a request to the trading houses to be given the leavings of their tables. Many of the party, if they acted on the promptings of their own feelings, would return to America, but they were afraid of being accused of acting in their own interests, and abandoning the noble work they went out to pursue.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country. Some constitutions acclimatize with difficulty, others never; while some fall victims to fever as soon as they reach their destination, and before commencing work.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN PROBLEM', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The world outside of Africa has not yet stopped to consider the peculiar conditions which lift that continent out of the range of the ordinary agencies by which Europe has been able to occupy other countries.

He fitted out the expedition entirely at his own expense. He, it would be remembered, was the first to settle the point of the existence of a large snowy mountain in Africa, under the Equator. The Baron, he was sorry to say, had lost both his steamers, and when last heard of was nearly dead himself. He had been fighting with the natives; one European and all the natives went down in the small steamer, and the doctor who accompanied the expedition had been ill, but when last heard of was recovering. He was not able to go further into the details of the misfortune. The other failure was that of the expedition of M. Du Chaillu, who had devoted the whole of the little fortune realised by the sale of his book to fit out a little vessel suited for his purpose.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—A very large holder of shares in the West African Gold Mines has called my attention to a paragraph which appeared in the Daily News of March 17th, in which a correspondent of that journal ""earnestly expresses a hope that those who are offered shares in Gold Coast Mines will inform themselves of the deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" and also asserts that ""a white man cannot live there and work; the natives cannot be induced to work: as soon as a road is made the jungle grows over it again; the air is poisonous; and the people are debased beyond conception.""\n\nHaving first landed on the West Coast of Africa exactly thirty-one years ago, since which time I have spent less than six years in Europe, the remainder of the period being passed on the Coast, the Gold Coast Colony included, and, moreover, having returned from a visit of six months to the Gold Mines so recently as the end of July last, I trust that you will kindly permit me to contradict, in the most unqualified manner, all the statements of the unknown correspondent of the Daily News.\n\nThe mere fact that I have passed more than half my life in Western Equatorial Africa, including one continued residence there of ten, and another of five years, and am now in good health, and that I can name many Europeans and Americans who have spent as many, if not more, years there, is in itself a sufficient refutation of the supposed (and quite illusory) ""deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" when they are not constitutionally unfitted for residence in tropical regions, and will take proper care of themselves, and listen to the advice of ""old Coasters.""

We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

It is commonly assumed that the major constraint on population numbers in traditional societies has been the availability of food. However, E. Boserup has argued that critical population densities do not lead to a Malthusian situation but to changes in the methods of cultivation: 'the low rates of population growth found (until recently) in pre-industrial communities cannot be explained as the result of insufficient food supplies due to overpopulation, and we must leave room for other factors in the explanation of demographic trends ... medical, biological, political, etc.'$^{22}$ The African past may well have been more complex than this and the ultimate bounds may have been those of food resources, even though infrequently brought into play. The land available for farming was that land not proscribed by other uses; for instance, the nearly deserted land between warring kingdoms had alternative employment as a no-man's land. In much of the continent little land appeared to be in use at any one time, either because slash-and-burn or savanna shifting cultivation meant that most land at any given time was fallow or because hunters and food gatherers needed huge areas for their support. Only occasionally did extreme famine conditions strike, caused by drought or locusts or by the disorganization arising from war or epidemic. The crisis was usually too sudden to allow any substantial temporary invasion of the fallow,$^{23}$ and in effect the limits of the carrying capacity of the land were reached with resulting huge mortality and a drop in population numbers for decades. The pressure on the capacity of the system to produce food was usually - but not always - too short and sudden to produce the successive changes in methods of land use that Boserup describes.

A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

This uplands shift in population continues today. It involves transitions in production and diet among those pressing upland, the compression of population in the higher elevations, and the expansion of Luo-speaking communities. The process of upland migration has produced some of the highest rural population densities in Africa in the twentieth century, contributing to the exhaustion of soil and the depletion of forest and woodland reserves. 19 Those who did not migrate upland continued to suffer the shortfalls of a fragile agricultural system. The occasional markets offered some relief, permitting the exchange of cattle, grazed in the lowlands, for grain and root crops grown more successfully at the higher elevations. Since, in the lowlands, the period of hunger was also the period of heaviest labour demand for cultivating and sowing of grains in the first rains, the occasional markets provided a means of overcoming rather quickly the excessively long dry season or an earlier short harvest.

Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy.

They finished the people and our work together; and had I believed that the scourge had been half as sweeping as I now find it to be, I should not have come up. I am, of course, sorry to see the failure of my hopes, though through no fault of my own, and I deeply regret ever giving the slightest credence to the protestations of desire on the part of Portuguese statesmen for the civilization of Africa; for with half the labour and expense on the Rovuma we should have left an enduring mark on the East Coast of Africa; while here our footsteps have been dogged, and native emissaries employed to neutralise all our efforts. The most bitter point of all is to see this line of coast, from Cape Delgado to Delagoa Bay, left to those who were the first to begin the slave-trade, and are determined to be the last to abandon it. What a turmoil you Cape people made a few years ago about a few convicts. But fancy 900 miles of coast four-fifths slave 'preserve' and one-fifth convict settlement, and the only religious mission allowed charged 4d. a pound on calico, which they bring to purchase food at a port which they never use. It is, however, very pleasant to see a new bishop and his band of labourers coming in as we retire. Though the blame of the first party's blunders were attempted to be shifted on to my shoulders—not by the good and noble Bishop Mackenzie though—I did with all my heart welcome Bishop Tozer and Mr. Ellington; and, with the greater caution the present gentleman seems to possess, I earnestly wish the mission abundant success. He feels as most do, that the highlands had not a fair trial, and the deaths in the lowlands are enough to prove that sedentary habits are there destructive to life. Without continual activity, we who have been exposed so long in low-lying localities, should all have been in our graves. Our last sad loss, in the Tetté journey, had neither our knowledge nor consent. The bishop likes Merambula as a fair spot for trial. We went only once to the top, and found it about 4,000 feet high. It has nice little fountains and valleys up there, and a hot fountain at the bottom. I can give no opinion about it, except that it seems as likely to be free from fever as the hills here. Everywhere a man has to take as much care of himself here in the matter of chills, wet feet, &c., as at home, and good common sense will help one more than daily doses of quinine. Now that the Church has begun a mission, it cannot be abandoned, unless it is clear that Europeans cannot live; and as Portuguese with all their terrible debaucheries survive, surely men with regular lives will live and become blessings. The anxiety felt about the means of the Society might be diminished by joining one of the great Church societies. If they retire from other than lack of health, it will be, I suppose, the first mission that ever turned tail; but I have no fears. We cannot bring the Pioneer down till the flood of December; and it being clearly the intention of our Government that she should not be abandoned, we imagine to improve the intermediate time by examining the north end of the lake. The sight of the devastation around gave me a month of dysentery, and took away all energy as to carrying the Lady Nyassa across. All was ready, part of the road made, and a waggon-load on to start; but feeling that unless some restriction on Portuguese forays on our footsteps could be put on, and some of the 'dog-in-the-manger' policy of the rivers got over, it was useless for me to risk private property to such an amount in the enterprise. If we could have stopped the enormous slave-trade of Lake Nyassa I would gladly have spent all the money I ever received. Now we shall screw her together again, and may sell her in India. I take Mokololo with me, the only reliable fellows in the country. The murders they are charged with are imaginary. Only one murder was committed, and two deaths were justifiable; of the rest I can find no evidence. They promptly went, at the call of Bishop Mackenzie, to punish Joazamba; lent the mission cloth to a large amount in its need, buried the bishop decently, carried Burrup some fifty or sixty miles, and when a mission hut was burnt and several guns went off in it, many, supposing the English attacked by an armed force, rushed to the rescue.""}, {'id': 3448, 'article_title': 'Concoctions of Mischief in Lagos', 'full_section_title': 'Concoctions of Mischief in Lagos', 'last_edit_date': '09-15-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1877#article-22', 'issue_date': '01_11_1877', 'content': 'Sir,—As your most appreciated journal is intended for the good of Africa and her people, and seeing plots being invented to the contrary, we forward this to you for publication, and hope that mischief-makers will ""cease to do evil and learn to do well.""\n\nThe disturbances and commotions between the Ibadans and the Eghas, commenced a few years ago, are rising to such a height, that it is feared a desperate war will result. They have been only engaged hitherto in skirmishing; and the wild boys among the Ibadans are visiting Egba farms and villages, spoiling and setting fire to them, and carrying away captive men, women, and children. These are warlike people, and resolute in their actions. By starvation, the Ijesa country was taken; and by besieging Ijaye for years, they took it; and they would now shake Abeokuta in a similar way, if the inhabitants are not awake, and on the alert to give them a full attack at first sight, and prevent them. They are also generally known to be contentious, offensive, and oppressive to neighbouring towns; having no particular trade, but that of war, and capturing people, whom they also sell in cases of necessity. Hence several of these which have been tributary to them are now on the part of the Egbas; and the Ijebus are determined to start for Ibadan as soon as the Ibadans leave for Abeokuta.\n\nBut what are the causes of the dispute? One is, that the Ibadans charged the Egbas with having attacked by the way those whom they sent to purchase powder, and robbed them of the same (a charge of long occurrence, but false). The particular cause is, that they are being instigated by a certain club in Lagos, of a certain tribe, who hold occasional meetings, in which plots are concocted, and means devised (known between them and the Ibadans) to effect the entire subjugation of the Egbas. Some of these officious interposers are intelligent men—ecclesiastical officers, Scripture readers, long-coated clergymen; even Christians who kneel down before the Throne of Grace, and pray weekly that God would deliver them from all evil and mischief, from the crafts of the Devil, from all sedition, privy conspiracy, from envy, hatred, and malice, and all uncharitableness, and from the everlasting damnation, which they are wilfully drawing upon themselves; men who have kept to themselves their personal liberty; preachers who mount pulpits, proclaiming that the object of the Gospel is to lessen the dissensions which afflict the world, and bring peace on earth, good-will among men. Let them, therefore, consider the results of these practices, and cease.\n\nMr. Editor, the seeds of destruction, famine, loss of trade, and hindering God\'s work are now sown, and are sure to be reaped to a great extent, except by the merciful interposition of God, if we allow the past wicked actions of these plotters to continue.

From the boundary of their territory to the town of Abeokuta the distance is, as the crow flies, about 85 miles of land, which is inhabited by the Yoruba tribes of the Ketus and Egbados. Towards the south lies the territory of Porto Novo, Ado, Ota, Badagry; the whole extending north to south about 45 miles. This gives an area of about 3,000 square miles of land inhabited by industrious farm labourers; it is the region from which we draw our supply of animal and vegetable provisions, the country which to a large degree supplies the trade of Lagos; the Ijebu country in the east being as yet only open on its coast line. Now what is the result of the annual inroads of the Dahomeyans into this territory? Let it be understood that the inhabitants of these 3,000 square miles do not, for one-third of the year, feel themselves safe from attack, and that this third of the year is the most important part of the year to the farmers—the planting time. It has happened during the last few years that the poor farmers have been lingering about their farms preparing them for the planting of yams, Indian corn, and other things, when the enemy has fallen upon them and carried them away, so that the authorities of Abeokuta have now forbidden them to remain in their farm-villages during this season of danger. But what is the consequence of all this? People fear the breaking out of famine in Abeokuta—a large town inhabited by 100,000 farmers. What an anomaly in a country so thinly populated, and deprived, as it has been so largely, of its able-bodied labourers, by a century of the slave-trade, and yet so it is. This very year the Dahomeyan hordes hunted the country up and down, making towns and villages unsafe, kidnapping on a large scale—refugees from Ota came even here to Lagos—until they finally pounced upon two villages in the Ketu country, which they completely sacked, and returned loaded with plunder. Under such circumstances, how can trade flourish, when people are unable to obtain the necessaries of life, and when their town is threatened with famine? It is but little likely that he who is in anxiety about the needful harvest will take much trouble to gather in palm-nuts, which ripen during the same first four months of the year, or to gather in the cotton which at the same time whitens his fields. Both must rot or be destroyed by birds and insects. It is not easy to imagine how great the amount of produce would be that might be obtained from this extensive region if those yearly raids were put a stop to. One strange feature in the case is, that this happens so near to Lagos—only some twenty miles from the lagoon, which is navigable nearly the whole of the before-mentioned eighty-five miles of territory. The loss arising from these raids is not by any means confined to the people who are the first to suffer; but the trade of Lagos, whether as regards that done in the direction of Abeokuta, Badagry, or Porto Novo, suffers most seriously. It is to be hoped that England will not overlook this matter when the time for settlement with the King of Dahomey comes.

All the time we were talking about the Ashanti war, it was mere child\'s play; it is now that there is war. On the 5th instant—a never-to-be-forgotten day—from 9 o\'clock in the morning, the bush people commenced coming into town with their property, their children, their sick, aged, lame, blind, wounded, and killed. It was a dreadful sight to witness. Between 2 and 7 o\'clock, the influx of people was indeed great, and the effluvia arising as they passed was awful. The crowd was so thick, that the poor people were almost treading on each other; the very little were being dragged along; all rushing to Cape Coast for safety, for the Ashantis were pursuing them. The men who went to fight also returned, every one of them, in great fright and confusion. The excitement was intense. The people were flocking in all night long; and there was such weeping and wailing all night. Some missed their wives, some their husbands, and others their children; and others again their money and other things. We had no sleep that night, and on the morning of the 6th the excitement was worse. The Ashantis were said to be only five miles from Cape Coast—that is, at Sweet River. A great many warriors went out, but returned again. On that day they brought nine Ashantis altogether—six living ones, a seventh very badly wounded (he said the Ashantis were determined to come to Cape Coast to fight), and the heads of two others. Two men\'s heads were cut off at Sweet River, a third by Mr. Taylor\'s farm. On the 7th, it was reported that Ashantis were at Mrs. Barne\'s farm, at Aboom, and at Salt Pond near us. You can just imagine what a panic the town was in: people running every way; some going into town, some going up street. All the brick-sheds were occupied by the bush people; they cook and sleep all about in the streets. Our cellar under the balcony is thick with people. The people from Commenda (the other side of Elmina) are all coming to Cape Coast. The Ashantis are after them, too; they cannot pass through Elmina, as the Elmina people do not like them, so they come by water, and every day some of them die at the landing. In one hour eight boats were sunk; the other day five men were drowned; the day before that, two; yesterday one. Mr. F. C. Grant kindly sent a sailing-vessel to bring the women; she brought 300 of them yesterday, and is going back for more. The water the bush people drink is enough to kill them, and there has been no rain for some time now. They begin to die already. Yesterday they buried two in the field near us. There is never any market now at all; they have rooted up all the plants everywhere. On Tuesday, the 10th June, we had a very heavy shower of rain, of which the bush people were all very glad. Yesterday they buried two bush people again in the field. The sea is so rough that I do not think I shall be able to come. All the soldiers\' wives are going to be sent to Sierra Leone, except four. There are 100 white soldiers now in the Castle, and the West Indian troops are expected. The Ashantis are said to be at Elmina now. All that part of Elmina that are for the English and the British Subjects, are all in the Castle there now. Achampong and other Ashantis are in the town. The man-of-war, Druid, is gone there this morning to watch their movements. They passed many people with small-pox on the day they came to town, all naked. The Ashantis have captured a great many Fantis and some Cape Coast people; some were killed, others taken to Coomassie. The merchants and the educated natives have formed themselves into a company, and go patrolling every night; besides, other patrols go out; the Houssas go out also. The people that came into the town on the 5th were said to be about 20,000, but I think they must have been more; and from that day to this they are coming in from all parts; but some of them have left Cape Coast and gone to Anamaboe and other places, as they could not get food here.""', 'last_edit_date': '1873-06-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_07_1873#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'RAILWAY SCHEMES FOR SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When there is a promise of a settled and peaceful state of affairs it is disappointing that it should not result in a greater flow of trade. There are various causes assigned for the depression in Sierra Leone. I may mention some of these. Stoppage of the slave traffic: A few years ago it was the practice of traders, called Banjuls, from Bathurst, to betake themselves to the riverine towns of the Protectorate, and purchase slaves brought from up-country, and take them back to Bathurst; and the money brought for this purpose was usually spent in Freetown. Again, traders from the Susu country and Futa Yallon used to drive cattle to Freetown, barter them there for trade guns, powder, and Manchester goods, proceed up country—preferably to those parts where slave raiding and tribal wars were going on—purchase the captives taken, and return with them to their own country. All this trade is now stopped, and I do not suppose any right-minded person can regret it when he considers the iniquities of the slave traffic. During my tour last year in the interior I released several parties of slaves consisting of men, women, and children, either shackled with chains or led along tied to one another with halters round their necks. Another cause of the depression has been attributed to the attitude assumed by the domestic slaves, who are not so subservient as formerly to their masters, who find it difficult to get them to gather the produce and send it to the markets. However, I have found that those masters who treat their slaves kindly do not lose them. Hundreds of slaves come every week to Freetown with trade canoes across from Bullom and the adjacent shores, and I have heard no complaints of their deserting their masters. A third cause assigned is the influx of Natives from the interior and the emigration of labourers. It is estimated that 6,000 labourers have proceeded to the Congo since the commencement of the year. This emigration may affect the producing power, but numbers of these labourers return with their wages, which they spend in the Colony; and those who come to Freetown and obtain work there convert their earnings into goods and return with them to their masters. The cessation of the raids and wars which supplied the slave traders, and the entire prohibition of the traffic, must revolutionise the system of trade, and probably accounts for some of the depression that has prevailed, which has been even more felt in French Guinea, as I am informed, than in the Colony of Sierra Leone.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Intestine wars had broken out amongst the natives in the Mellicourie country, near Sierra Leone, and several European factories had been destroyed and plundered.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is quite impossible for us to dismiss the very important subject of a deficiency of public revenue at Sierra Leone with the brief notice taken of it in our last. The interesting communications that we have lately inserted, made by persons but too deeply concerned in the Educational department of the colony, on which, with that of religious teaching—the Native Pastorate—the earliest discomforts of the position seem to have fallen, in strict accordance with the old official principles of government in the colony, appeal too strongly to our well-known sympathies and convictions to allow of our doing so. We have received so many letters during the last few months, in which the writers give most saddening pictures of the moral state and condition of the colony, which our personal experience of a too prevalent dishonesty only too fully confirms, that we look upon the curtailment of education and of public religious teaching with the most serious alarm for the future of the colony and for the reputation of Sierra Leoneans everywhere down the Coast. We are quite aware that the old enemies of the African people will point to those conditions of individual mind and practice which our correspondents stigmatize, and of which we complain, and say, ""Education and religious teaching, forsooth! behold the fruits of them; we have had too much of them already. Some of the greatest cheats are men who have more than any other a redundancy of Scripture phrases at the tip of their tongue."" But they are grossly mistaken. Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people.

There is absolutely not a single place, where the natives are left to their own free-will, in which there is the slightest evidence of a desire for better things. The worst vices and diseases of Europe have found a congenial soil, and the taste for spirits has risen out of all proportion to their desire for clothes—the criterion with many of growth in grace.\n\nThe inaptitude of the natives for civilization is nowhere shown more distinctly than among the Kru-boys, a tribe which every one admits is the most docile, the most manageable, and most intelligent on the coast. To a man, the Kru-boys have spent years in contact with such ameliorating influences as are to be found in those parts, yet their tastes have risen no higher than a desire for gin, tobacco, and gunpowder. These they get in return for a few months\' or a year\'s labour, to go back home and for a few short days enjoy a fiendish holiday. I visited one of their villages and such a scene of squalor and misery I have rarely seen.

This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone.

In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies.

The week-long Congress was intended to promote interest in Afro-American missionary work in Africa, and also in the rights of 'Africans in America'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The spread of Christianity, Islam and western education was another important impact of colonialism. There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony. It is signifi› cant that except in North Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar, these languages have remained the official languages even to this very day.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'The missionary factor', 'content': ""Both missionary Christianity and education were also important factors which determined the course and nature of African responses to colonial conquest. The missionaries had created an African class of evangelists, teachers, journalists, businessmen, lawyers and clerks who often seemed to accept the supposed cultural inferiority of the Africans, to accept settler colonialism as a fact of life and who admired the white man for his power, wealth and technology.$^{2}$ Examples of these individuals were Tiyo Soga (1829^71), the first African missionary to be ordained by the United Presbyterian Church in Britain, founder of the Mgwali mission where he preached to both Africans and Europeans, and translator of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress into Xhosa as U-Hambo Lom-Hambi, the first book written by an African to be published by the Lovedale Press, in 1867; John Langalibalele Dube, a Methodist minister, an ardent follower of the black American educationalist, Booker T. Washington, founder-president of the Zulu Christian Industrial School, the Natal Bantu Business League and the first president of the African National Congress; John Tengo Jabavu (1859-1921), a devout Methodist, founder-editor of the English/ Xhosa weekly Imvo Zabantsundu; and Walter Rubusana, a Congregationalist minister and the only African ever elected to the Cape Provincial Council.\nIdeologically, these mission-educated Africans shared the universalism, utopianism and non-racialism of the missionaries and of the Aborigines' Protection Society. They were committed to constitutionalism, gradualism, and cultural assimilation as advocated by a few white liberals among the settlers. But they also were disciples of Booker T. Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic. They generally acquiesced in colonial expansion and conquest, partly because, like the missionaries, they associated colonialism with Christianity and 'civilization', and partly because they respected the 'overwhelming superiority' of European weapons and warfare."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Evangelical Christianity', 'content': ""Evangelical Christianity, in whose eyes the Origin of Species was damnable heresy, had no qualms, nevertheless, in accepting its racial implications.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Christianity in the colonial era', 'content': ""The African response to the missionary endeavour expressed itself in three distinct ways: acceptance, rejection and adaptation. There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley. The itinerant Liberian prophet, William Wade Harris, travelled through the Ivory Coast and the Apolonia District of the Gold Coast between 1910 and 1915 and converted some 100 000 people.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

Experiments were tried which could not have been done without expense. Some instances were mentioned to me, which were evidently nothing more than differences of judgment between Mr. Saker and the local board; the latter judging that to be wasteful which did not meet with their approval. But it must be remembered that Mr. Saker found nothing to his hand; he had to plan, to conceive, to construct everything, with few or no resources on the spot. After the fullest consideration I could give to these adverse statements, and after inspecting the presumed evidences of this waste, it is my deliberate judgment that, while in some cases the statements have been exaggerations, in others, when the destructive effects of climate are considered—the interruptions occasioned by illness—the thefts of the native population—the slow and inadequate workmanship of the men Mr. Saker has instructed—the delay arising from want of materials to finish the work, and for which resort must be had to the stores and workshops of England—Mr. Saker has done his best, has never wilfully wasted the Society\'s property, and has not been guilty of extravagance. On the contrary, I marvel at the amount of work, both secular and religious, accomplished in the twenty-one years of Mr. Saker\'s toil. He has exhibited an endurance, a devotedness in the Master\'s service, an heroic struggle with perils and difficulties on every hand, which few missionaries are called to exercise, and which his successors will not have to encounter.""\n\nYour Committee are deeply interested in the testimony borne by Dr. Underhill to the character and devotedness of the junior brethren.

For the Lord\'s sake, for the sake of the salvation of these savage and barbarous tribes, they gladly encounter numerous perils, and fearlessly meet the dangers which a residence among an uncivilised people involves.

This may be clearly seen when looking into the number of young people brought up in that Society, and the number of promising youths brought up in the college at King Tom's Point in Freetown, most of whom would, to the society's credit, have held prominent positions in its service if a little caution and kindness had been taken and shown by those directing this Society in that colony. But, alas! through gross neglect, these promising youths, especially those composing their agents, were all discouraged and driven out of that Society, and are left entirely to their own way, through the mal-administration of those inexperienced brethren into whose hands the Committee had so confidently entrusted the entire direction of the Society in Sierra Leone. The Wesleyan Missionary Committee seem, at last, to understand the state of things, and what occasioned the losses sustained by the desertion of all their agents, and to have now resolved, not only to extend their field of labour in Africa, but also to raise up as many of these young men as may be found, knowing that they are capable, even in the highest degree, with God's assistance, of effecting the conversion of their countrymen. Would to God the Committee knew the number of promising youths brought up in the Wesleyan College in Freetown, and the unnecessary course pursued in turning them out of the Mission work! These agents could not apply to the Committee for redress, and the Society, in her report, would represent these youths as being very ungodly and undutiful indeed, as brethren on whose testimonies the Committee solely depend, report that all their agents in Sierra Leone are ungodly and undutiful men, and the matter becomes dead and inquired into no further; whilst the contrary is the case. In one of our publications in Freetown we have been able to mention that a Mr. Woode, late agent, who was unreasonably dismissed by one of their ministers, and was afterwards employed in the Customs Department in Freetown, where a liberal salary was allowed him, has been since recalled by this Society to perform catechetical duties, together with a Mr. Samuel Davis, an agent, and Mr. Harding, all of whom are now recommended to the ministry. If those who were set over the affairs of the Society in Sierra Leone had fully known their responsibility to God for the souls of those young men whom they had trained, they would have kept them in the field of labour, and would not have dispensed with their services for frivolous matters. We are also very glad to hear that the Wesleyan Missionary Society in Lagos has recalled and secured the services of the following gentlemen, viz: Messrs. W. B. George, Moses C. Hagan, John B. Deigh, and Samuel B. Taylor; the two former being placed immediately under catechetical duties. All these were students under the Rev. James Jackson Wray, James Robert, and James W. Berry, all European tutors in the Wesleyan Institution, King Tom's Point, in Sierra Leone. There is no doubt that some of these young men could have continued their labours if they had received the slightest encouragement from their superiors; but instead of this, the Committee, it was said, ordered that their services be dispensed with, because a self-supporting system was to be established. We attribute much praise and thanks to the Rev. J. Milum, of Lagos, who has been the instrument in recalling these young men to their original work. Most of them, we learn, are, or were, holding responsible positions and receiving liberal salaries in the Government and other offices in that settlement, yet they hesitated not to return when the offer was made them by that gentleman. This shows that they entertained no desire to leave the Mission service if they had only received encouragement, not thinking that it is any dissatisfaction with their secular position that prompts them to return, but that they set great value upon the work for which they were trained, and cannot rest satisfied till they are grounded in their proper element. Imagine what vast numbers of youths were trained up in the Wesleyan Missionary Society at King Tom's Point. If not more, they are equal, at least, to those trained by the Church Missionary Society in that colony. What of all these promising youths? Can we even point out half-a-dozen useful men amongst them now? Can it be possible that of over a hundred youths trained up by that Society, not one has the desire to minister in the holy Sanctuary of God, but all to be otherwise employed? We answer, No; the fault rests solely on those in the colony who wield the sway of the Society. But the Church Missionary Society seemed to maintain contrary views on this point. For a moment just throw a glance over their field of labour, and you will find that their stations are filled up by young men of their own training. There are ministers, deacons, catechists, and schoolmasters, many of whom are sent into the very heart of Africa to teach and preach the Gospel to their countrymen; and even wherever there be a European missionary, there is also an African agent to be found, as it is utterly impossible for a European to work successfully in heathen lands without assistance being rendered by native agents. Can any of these be pointed out in the Wesleyan Missionary Society? None, but a Mr. Thorpe alone. Messrs. Marke and King are picked-up men. How has this happened? Is it because students of the Church Missionary Society are much better qualified than those of the Wesleyan? Is it because young men from the Wesleyan Missionary Institution are not sufficiently intelligent to minister in these functions? or is it because the Wesleyan Missionary Committee in England has no desire that youths trained at King Tom's Point, at an enormous expense, should be made as useful as those of the Church Missionary Society? We answer, No. It is because those into whose hands the Committee had entrusted the affairs of the Society in Freetown have very greatly erred. They cared but very little for the services, labours, and welfare of their youths, and would not by any means recommend them to the notice of the Committee as deserving promotion, but rather depress them; whilst the Church Missionary Society set great value upon their youths, especially those whom they themselves have trained. We are happy indeed to find that the Wesleyan Missionary Committee at home is now looking into matters from a different point of view, and sending out a man of such a philanthropic character as the Rev. J. Milum is described to be. He, too, seems to view matters in the same light as the Committee now views them; he seems to admire young men of intelligence, values and encourages them in their labours, and manifests great sympathy when necessity requires him to do so. He seems to be aware that Europeans alone, labouring without the assistance of Africans, cannot succeed so well. For if we look at the period when Europeans only were sent out for the Christianization of the Africans, and contrast it with the period since the Bight of Benin was put into the hands of the African Bishop to Christianize, we shall find that the Gospel has more swiftly run its course through the latter. Is it not obvious in this instance that Africans are also one of the very best means to be employed in effecting the conversion of their heathen brethren? Just cast a glance over the Church Missionary stations in the Niger, and you will find that the whole are occupied by Africa's sons. What retards the progress of the Wesleyan Mission, and prevents their occupying stations in this extensive field? Were not a few men—viz., Messrs. Roach, Jackson, and others—sent down that way for the purpose about twenty years ago, perhaps before, if the Church Missionary Society made a movement there?

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary. He has mistaken his vocation. He may be a very good man, he may have high and exalted motives, he may ardently desire the conversion of the heathen; but if human infirmities of mind and temper'}, {'id': 4052, 'article_title': 'LAGOS IMMORALITY', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS IMMORALITY', 'last_edit_date': '08-23-1880', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1880#article-9', 'issue_date': '01_10_1880', 'content': 'Sir,—Permit me a brief space in the columns of your invaluable journal to inquire, at the hands of the Finance Committee of the Church Missionary Society, in this place, what their intention is regarding the conduct of their schoolmaster here in charge of one of the Church Day Schools, who has been guilty of indecency with a girl connected with that Church, whether they intend passing it over to the scandal of the whole Yoruba Mission.\n\nPublic indignation was much roused when the heinous crime could no longer be kept secret, especially when it is known that whatever the state of vice in this community, a redeeming feature, the only one calculated to do a world of good is the moral conduct of the clergy and other missionary agents amongst us; but when, time after time, the conduct of some of these men finds them out, though very much to be deplored, one cannot help but advocate the disconnection of such with the parent stock, and regard as dangerous to the true interests of Christ\'s Church amongst us, any attempt at screening such a culprit as we are writing about from the justice of a course of action he so much merits by any patron, however potent.

The people were comparatively fearless and friendly, and food was fairly abundant, large gardens in good cultivation surrounding most of the towns.

They walked 169 miles, thirty-one of which were on Mr. Stanley\'s road, now nearly overgrown with grass. They had much difficulty in procuring food for their thirty Kroo boys on this side, but, by paying rather highly for it, managed to get a sufficiency. Bwa-bwa Njali, and the other chiefs at the Pool, received them at first in a friendly way, but afterwards, for some unexplained reason, turned suddenly hostile, and refused to let them cross the river, in order to carry out the plan they had formed of returning by the south side. Our friends had reason to suspect the adverse influence was a foreign one, similar to that which opposed Messrs. Crudgington and Bently on their visit. They returned consequently as far as Nkenke River, near which they secured land for a station from the friendly chief of a populous district; cut timber, cleared the ground, and began to build. It was needful, however, to bring up stores from Bemba, to which station, consequently, they returned after a month\'s absence. Letters from home which met them there decided them, before continuing their building near Inkissi, to explore the rest of the south side from Bemba up to Stanley Pool, so as to be in a position to determine by which road it would be best to carry up the steamer for the upper river. They started on this second journey of exploration about the middle of January, Mr. Ingham remaining at Bemba with Mr. Frederickson, and Mr. Lanceley going forward with the pioneer party.

When I went to East Africa in 1884 the Universities' Mission had no organised work on Lake Nyassa. In that year, in answer to the appeal of the Rev. W. P. Johnson, who had been working there alone, funds for a missionary steamer were provided, and since 1885 missionary work has been regularly and successfully carried on. There is an increasing body of Christians at Likoma, a small but populous island which serves as our headquarters. Schools under native teachers have been established at the large villages on the eastern shore, and are regularly visited by Mr. Johnson in the steamer. Wherever there are schools missionary work is being done.\n\nI have now been five times to Lake Nyassa. This means a walk of 450 miles from Lindi, on the east coast, or a tedious journey from Zanzibar of at least a month by sea and by the river Zambesi. I have each time walked one way as being more useful from a missionary point of view, and twice I have walked the double journey, making a detour to visit powerful chiefs or populous districts on my way. Till last year I have always had good health when travelling, but during my last journey, though I had the help of a donkey, my strength gave way, and at the end I broke down completely and had a long and serious illness. I find that I cannot any longer undertake these long journeys, and my experience has taught me that it is quite impossible for any one man to exercise episcopal supervision over both the work of the mission at Lake Nyassa and the work at Zanzibar and on the east coast.\n\nThe present seems also a very fitting one for establishing a bishopric in Nyassaland. A large tract of country adjacent to the lake has now become a British protectorate, and the English Government appear determined to make that protectorate a reality and to take strong measures to put down the slave trade on the lake. It is likely that a good many English people will be attracted to the Shiré Highlands. There are large heathen populations everywhere, untouched by any mission. It is found that there is no surer way of developing the work of the Church than by sending out a resident Bishop if wisely chosen.""}, {'id': 6484, 'article_title': 'The Hausa Language and People', 'full_section_title': 'The Hausa Language and People', 'last_edit_date': '07-13-1894', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1894#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_08_1894', 'content': 'Mr. James Irving, on behalf of the Geographical Society, expressed the pleasure which the Council felt at having Mr. Robinson amongst them.

A master carpenter, for instance, came for information as to the best means of reaching Sierra Leone, and the chances of buying land there, and he stated that it was his definite intention to go there in the coming autumn. We learnt, on inquiry, that this man did the best carpentering in Antigua, and it was fully believed that he was actuated by the best of motives. Another man, a worker in leather, stated that he was going to do the same. It became very clear that the Church in Antigua was deeply conscious of its part and lot in the Rio Pongo Mission. The Rev. C. W. Farquhar\'s name acted as a talisman there. Many were most anxious to hear about him and his wife, both of whom had taught in the Mico Training School in St. John\'s. The Bishop afforded us the opportunity of meeting the clergy of the island, and after a very exhaustive explanation and discussion one elderly clergyman of colour said that if only he were younger he would offer to go himself. All were of opinion that something should be done to make the Rio Pongo Mission more effective, and, while it was felt that there was little hope of much money being forthcoming, it was agreed that nothing stood in the way of training men continuously for this great work. And as we stood up in the Cathedral, amidst a congregation of some 2,000 people, or at another time faced an equal number of young people so largely African in the same building, we felt bound to concur. Individual offers of service were made, some on the mere impulse of the moment, others perhaps with a truer comprehension of all that was involved.

We refer our readers again to his letter on this very important point, because we feel that as the past has depended, so the future must in no small degree depend, on this of late most calumniated body of men.

The agricultural improvement of the colony demands the special attention of Government authorities; and when, as in this case, a means is pointed out which only requires a better disposal of the revenues raised in the colony itself, by making them instrumental in obtaining reproductive results from the enforced labour of the criminal portion of the population, instead of that labour being wasted, as at present, no trivial objections or inapplicable theories ought to be allowed to stand in the way of its adoption. There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil.

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

Few societies that effect any permanent good are grand in their beginnings. Precociousness in them, as in children, is fatal to real power. Fiction alone starts into complete existence; while the realities of life build up gradually the individual and general structures of human history. Error is glittering; nothing is easier than to dazzle and win with it. Truth is the reverse of this; and struggles amid difficulty and hardship into appreciation and favour. Look at our great missionary societies. Consult their early records. The Church Missionary Society was at first very coldly received. During some years its income fluctuated from three or four hundred to a thousand pounds a-year. People who could not, or did not, care to see, or were unable to grasp the great principle of its existence, sneered at it, no doubt. It was doing nothing, of course. No one could perceive any rich fruit of its exertions; and yet it had sown and gathered something in from the first seed—and yet it was from the first moment gradually advancing toward the great harvest of its present utility—and yet it had securely laid the foundation of its present goodly edifice. The germ of its actual vigorous life was swelling amid the cerements of the national apathy, anon to throw out its roots, to raise high its head and spread wide its branches; to fatten and flourish in the rich soil and sunshine of popular wealth and favour, and cast around the precious leaves of Christian truth appointed for the healing of the nations.\n\nIt would justly be thought presumptuous in us to liken the African-Aid Society, now struggling through the diseases and feebleness of infancy, with that veteran society whose efforts have been crowned with much success. But there is no presumption in comparing the actual infancy of the one with the remote infancy of the other. All societies of slow development are subject to the same early maladies. The future alone can determine whether the African-Aid Society will pass safely through those to which it, in common with others, has been subject. But we fearlessly maintain that if actual service performed entitles to success, the African-Aid Society has established its claim.\n\nWhat was and is its self-imposed mission? To grapple with the material evils that oppress and degrade Africa, and its people—to hasten the annihilation of the atrocious slave-trade, which drains the African continent of its life's blood—and to aid and stimulate the development of the industrial resources which God has there so lavished."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'No one, we think, who has attentively considered the subject of missionary effort in native Africa, can have remained blind to the fact of the great obstacles placed in the way of such noble efforts, by the total absence among the African populations of those facilities for action which the accessories of an extensive commerce and of civilised rule, present to the missionary in almost all other great fields of missionary labour in heathen lands. The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support? Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools. The difficulties to be overcome in this mission have been very great; not the least being the necessity of providing the people with written languages. Mr. Saker has translated the Word of God in the Dualla, and has compiled a dictionary and hymn-book.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Thomson agrees with Dr. Blyden as to the causes of these astonishing results.

Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual.""

Indeed, it would seem that Islam fails to exert that power over any of the races of the great Bantu family which it exercises over the true negroes of the Soudan. Here, among the higher Bantu tribes south of the Congo, seems to be the region where Christian effort seems most likely to be crowned with success. The efforts of Moffat and Livingstone among the Bechuanas show how readily they embrace and retain the teaching of Christianity.

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The available evidence leads to the conclusion that the progress of Islam in Central Africa is more rapid than it is in India.

There is much independent testimony to the same effect. Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized. In Nigeria, a dispensary was opened in Ibadan in 1904 and others followed in Yoruba towns in succeeding years.$^{81}$ By 191 o the Sierra Leonean government"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm.

Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively.

The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies. The impact of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': ""In East and Central Africa, by as late as 1850 only a single society, the Church Missionary Society, was operating.

The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

Burckhardt, the Victorian traveller, observed that, alongside their bonded compatriots, poor African pilgrims largely from West Africa - known locally as 'Tekrourys' - served during their sojourn as porters, dockers, streetsweepers, firewood-fetchers, makers of pots, mats and baskets, and brewers of an intoxicating drink called 'bouza'. 17 In India, the African slave undertook a number of menial tasks which Indians either could not (because of caste restrictions) or would not perform, or for which the British deemed themselves to be unsuited. In the princely states, slaves, especially Africans, served primarily as domestics concubines, eunuchs, water carriers, barbers, personal guards, stableboys, etc. We are informed that the king of Oudh (in what is now Uttar Pradesh) was supplied in the early nineteenth century with many Ethiopian male and female slaves and paid princely sums for them. Upon purchase they were all converted to Islam. We are also told that 'the rich and aristocratic Muslims, especially those who lived in cities like Patna and Calcutta, used to own besides male and female slaves, a large number of Habshi [Ethiopian] eunuchs'.$^{18}$ As in earlier periods, African slaves were considered to be luxury and prestige commodities.

They finished the people and our work together; and had I believed that the scourge had been half as sweeping as I now find it to be, I should not have come up. I am, of course, sorry to see the failure of my hopes, though through no fault of my own, and I deeply regret ever giving the slightest credence to the protestations of desire on the part of Portuguese statesmen for the civilization of Africa; for with half the labour and expense on the Rovuma we should have left an enduring mark on the East Coast of Africa; while here our footsteps have been dogged, and native emissaries employed to neutralise all our efforts. The most bitter point of all is to see this line of coast, from Cape Delgado to Delagoa Bay, left to those who were the first to begin the slave-trade, and are determined to be the last to abandon it. What a turmoil you Cape people made a few years ago about a few convicts. But fancy 900 miles of coast four-fifths slave 'preserve' and one-fifth convict settlement, and the only religious mission allowed charged 4d. a pound on calico, which they bring to purchase food at a port which they never use. It is, however, very pleasant to see a new bishop and his band of labourers coming in as we retire. Though the blame of the first party's blunders were attempted to be shifted on to my shoulders—not by the good and noble Bishop Mackenzie though—I did with all my heart welcome Bishop Tozer and Mr. Ellington; and, with the greater caution the present gentleman seems to possess, I earnestly wish the mission abundant success. He feels as most do, that the highlands had not a fair trial, and the deaths in the lowlands are enough to prove that sedentary habits are there destructive to life. Without continual activity, we who have been exposed so long in low-lying localities, should all have been in our graves. Our last sad loss, in the Tetté journey, had neither our knowledge nor consent. The bishop likes Merambula as a fair spot for trial. We went only once to the top, and found it about 4,000 feet high. It has nice little fountains and valleys up there, and a hot fountain at the bottom. I can give no opinion about it, except that it seems as likely to be free from fever as the hills here. Everywhere a man has to take as much care of himself here in the matter of chills, wet feet, &c., as at home, and good common sense will help one more than daily doses of quinine. Now that the Church has begun a mission, it cannot be abandoned, unless it is clear that Europeans cannot live; and as Portuguese with all their terrible debaucheries survive, surely men with regular lives will live and become blessings. The anxiety felt about the means of the Society might be diminished by joining one of the great Church societies. If they retire from other than lack of health, it will be, I suppose, the first mission that ever turned tail; but I have no fears. We cannot bring the Pioneer down till the flood of December; and it being clearly the intention of our Government that she should not be abandoned, we imagine to improve the intermediate time by examining the north end of the lake. The sight of the devastation around gave me a month of dysentery, and took away all energy as to carrying the Lady Nyassa across. All was ready, part of the road made, and a waggon-load on to start; but feeling that unless some restriction on Portuguese forays on our footsteps could be put on, and some of the 'dog-in-the-manger' policy of the rivers got over, it was useless for me to risk private property to such an amount in the enterprise. If we could have stopped the enormous slave-trade of Lake Nyassa I would gladly have spent all the money I ever received. Now we shall screw her together again, and may sell her in India. I take Mokololo with me, the only reliable fellows in the country. The murders they are charged with are imaginary. Only one murder was committed, and two deaths were justifiable; of the rest I can find no evidence. They promptly went, at the call of Bishop Mackenzie, to punish Joazamba; lent the mission cloth to a large amount in its need, buried the bishop decently, carried Burrup some fifty or sixty miles, and when a mission hut was burnt and several guns went off in it, many, supposing the English attacked by an armed force, rushed to the rescue.""}, {'id': 3537, 'article_title': 'MISSIONARY VICTIMS TO AFRICAN CLIMATE.', 'full_section_title': 'MISSIONARY VICTIMS TO AFRICAN CLIMATE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1878#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_03_1878', 'content': 'The list of missionary victims to the climate in Africa will, we fear, be largely increased in the Eastern and Lake countries.

We extract the following remarks by Mr. Easmon: ""Parenthetically, I confess I always feel disgusted at the amount of ignorance and bad taste exhibited when I hear or read shameful remarks made against missionaries and their work, especially in Africa; for the more deeply I have examined the record of the earlier history of West Africa and also that of more recent years, the more fully have I been convinced that unless for these truly brave pious men, no matter what our political safety, we would have been to-day in the same condition of moral and intellectual blindness that our ancestors were during the early part of the last century. The possibility of existence of such a moral hybrid as a mercenary missionary cannot be doubted, but to roundly assert that white missionaries in their labours among us have been influenced by \'religious ambition to impress their dogmas on another race\' is a gratuitous assumption only worthy of those who are low-minded enough to conceive it; and to maintain that the sake of gain was their inspiring motive, is irreconcilable with facts. To the pure all things are pure! No one who is conversant with the details of missionary labour among us in the early part of the present century (ample testimony to which is borne by one of our most talented and benevolent Governors, one who had the interest of the people he governed at heart—the late Sir Charles M\'Carthy, and also by Parliamentary reports) can agree with the low estimate, or indulge in the sneering tones which our author seems only too ready to adopt. After reading the trials by disease and death among our early missionaries, a learned critic, and I perfectly agree with him, thus observes: \'There is something appalling to human nature, however elevated by divine grace above its ordinary level, in close approximation with pestilence and death, to feel that we stand on the verge of an ever open grave, into which we see one and another of our companions almost momentarily precipitated by a mysterious, invisible, but irresistible influence, and to know that there is nothing in our own case to exempt us from being the next victim after the last whom we saw engulfed.

Afterwards they went to Suakin, where they took camels and went to Berber. From there they proceeded to Khartoum by steamer. In that place they stayed for four days. They then took the steamer for Sardo—a journey of twenty-five days ordinarily, but they occupied sixty-eight, owing to the immense masses of vegetation. The country between Khartoum and Sardo is very unhealthy, fever being the most dangerous illness. From Sardo they passed to Beden. The river is navigable to that point. Falls then begin. From Beden they went to Kerri, and from Kerri to Rigaf, travelling from Rigaf to Labore, from Labore to Mugi, and from Mugi to Dufli. At Dufli they took a steamer, the Nyanza, and proceeded to Magungo, on the Albert Lake, and in the country of Ungoro. Thence they went to Keroto, and so to Kisuna and Foweira. At Foweira they took native canoes belonging to Rionga, the chief of the country, and went by the River Nile to Mrooli, the last Egyptian station. They received much assistance from Colonel Gordon, the Governor-General of the Soudan, through whose kindness they were enabled to reach Mrooli. From Mrooli they set off for Uganda with an escort of Waganda sent by M'tesa, reaching Rubaga, the capital, on February 14, 1879. Mr. Litchfield remained until April, 1880, when he left through ill-health. Mr. Pearson remained until April, 1881, rejoining Mr. Litchfield at Kagei, a missionary station at the south-west end of the lake. Fever compelled both of them to leave, and passing through the countries of Usukuma, Unyamuezi, Ugogo, and Usagara, they reached Saadari towards the end of September, 1881, and Zanzibar a few days later. Mr. Litchfield is still suffering from fever, but hopes shortly to start for England. Mr. Pearson showed me several jewels worn by the women of the country, and some war instruments.

So badly off were the party at latest accounts that they had sent a request to the trading houses to be given the leavings of their tables. Many of the party, if they acted on the promptings of their own feelings, would return to America, but they were afraid of being accused of acting in their own interests, and abandoning the noble work they went out to pursue.

Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers.

In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated.

The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CHRISTIAN MISSIONS IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Rev. J. P. Farler, of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, has made a spirited reply to Professor Lenz's attack on British missions in that region. Dr. Lenz returned in the spring from a journey across Africa. In the course of a sketch of his expedition he expressed an opinion that the outlay of vigour and money on the conversion of the natives is worse than thrown away. The negroes who persevere in Christianity, he declares, become disdainful of manual labour. They prefer to occupy themselves with noisy prayer meetings during their intervals of exertion. Most of their time is spent in loitering and in begging of white men. Their general destination, he alleges, is vagabondism, after which they abandon Christianity altogether, and turn professional criminals. Now Mr. Farler shows that Dr. Lenz has brought a universal indictment against missions in Africa, though the limits of his experience prove he is entitled to speak only of a portion. But Mr. Farler has no inclination to leave the Tanganyika and Nyassa settlements, which Dr. Lenz had opportunities of inspecting, under obloquy. He appeals to the effects produced in every locality in which missions have been established, in evidence that the results have not been small, and still less pernicious. To the magnitude of the difficulties the distinction achieved by travellers such as Dr. Lenz testifies. As Mr. Farler says, the explorer traverses the continent with all possible speed. His intercourse with the natives is confined to the employment of them for his own service. Their habits and moral condition are no concern of his. After a year or two he comes back to Europe, to be glorified by all classes of society. Mr. Farler does not deny the courageous traveller has borne hardships; but he asks, if that be praiseworthy, what is the due of Englishmen who expatriate themselves for life in the Dark Continent, not to learn its ways, but to purify them? If there be some meagreness in the results attained, he points out that the obstacles to be overcome are enormous. He refers to facts which no African traveller will gainsay in confirmation of his statement that much has been done, and in a manner which indicates the possibility of more hereafter."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEWS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Toils and Triumphs; or, Missionary Work in the World\'s Dark Places.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAMEROONS—AFRICAN CRUELTY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Nothing can better illustrate the savagery and barbarism among which our brethren labour in Africa than the following narrative.

Nothing but the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit can change the blood-thirsty natives into children of peace and love: ""Every now and again, some of these heathen people show their thirst for blood by committing some horrible deed of wickedness. A few days since a slave was seized by a number of freemen, and dragged to the beach, close to our mission; they were about tying his legs together, but when they saw me descending the hill, they hurried him into a canoe, which was taken out into the middle of the river; the poor fellow was thrown into the water, but, being a swimmer, he tried to hold the canoe, but was beaten across the head with paddles and sticks. When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver. Had the freemen been equally willing to hear us as were the slaves, they would have saved much suffering and the life of the young man would have been saved also. Frequently these palavers occupy much of our time, but it is not time lost; for it increases our influence for good amongst them, and often saves greater evils and the depression and stoppage of trade, both among themselves and between them and the European merchants.""', 'last_edit_date': '1871-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tribute to African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From a distinguished Christian labourer in Africa: ""From a twenty years\' African experience, I know some of the difficulties that beset your path in advocating the interests of Africa, and in seeking to promote the amelioration of her millions of inhabitants; but your path is that of truth and justice, which has prevailed, and will prevail, in doing good at home and abroad; therefore, take courage, and go on in the good work.""', 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began. As European nations increasingly became interested in the acquisition of African territories, the missionaries paved the way in some areas of Africa and served, quite consciously, as agents for European colonialism. Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

'The White Fathers were not able to return to their mission for almost fifty years'.$^{58}$ In 1885 the White Fathers took over two stations near Ujiji, which had been established by the African International Association after King Leopold of Belgium had decided to concentrate his efforts in the Congo Free State.\nUntil 1884, therefore, European pressures in the East African hinterland were mainly exerted by missionary societies. Even where there existed commercial activities, they were offshoots of missionary work. Two such examples existed. The first was the Livingstonia Central African Trading Company, which was associated with Scottish missionary activities in the Lake Nyasa region. Its aim was said to be that of supplying the mission station at Blantyre with necessities through running steamships in the waterways of the region and also that of bringing ivory for commerce at a price that would undercut the Arab merchants using slave labour for porterage.

A member of the Church, William Mackinnon, who owned the British India Steam Navigation Company, started running ships to Zan› zibar in 1872. A few years later he was able to convince the sultan of Zanzibar to approve his plan for building roads to Lake Nyasa and Lake Victoria.

Some, however, paraded a superficial Westernization in their dress, their homes, their food and drink and their way of life. The missions' purpose was to create a middle class in order to cream off an elite, which would then be trained on Western lines, and would secure and expand the twoway flow of trade to and from the coast. The spread of civilization would be an incidental by-product which the palm-oil trade, limited to coastal transactions, could not achieve on its own. 47 Thus the Protestant missions, very much of this world, took on the role of reformers, which included interfering in political and military strategy. The Abeokuta missionaries suggested to England the making of a road to the sea, in order to speed up the barter trade - and the delivery of war material. They invoked the technical help of British troops against Dahomey. At Calabar their influence in the city-states secured by agree› ment the ending of local customs that they considered objectionable. From their position of strength, the missions did not object to the rival intrusion of Western administrations, but counterbalanced it by siding with or against the established trade. Around 1850 the missions, together with the traders and the political administration, became involved in an irreversible process leading to an early form of colonial rule. The appointment of consuls with expansionist views went hand in hand with armed blockades and the establishment of protectorates.

Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town.

The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire.

For the delta merchants, it meant having to penetrate deeper into the hinterland to the centres of production, and the use of a larger labour force and canoes. It was a situation with the potential for making the old established leaders bankrupt, and encouraging the rise of new enterprising ones. Three major develop› ments flowed from this: first, the new trade led to an increase in the internal slave trade to supply the manpower requirements of the delta states; second, the growth of new Houses and Heads resulted in the disturbance of the internal political balance (Dike's slave revolts) and, third, competition for the hinterland markets led to several wars between the delta states."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 340, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '04-11-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_05_1864', 'content': '## AQUAPEM MOUNTAIN ROAD.  \nTO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.  \nAbokobi, March 9, 1864.\n\nSir,—The agents of the London houses* who promised you certain subscriptions towards this road, conditionally on the report of its being really constructing, have refused to pay those subscriptions.

But when he ordered the King of Aquapem to clear the roads, he did not say, finish what the missionaries have begun, and cleanse the roads they have made. Thus they did what he said—i.e., they cleared their old rugged path and left our new road uncleared. Now, the natives were confirmed in their old opinion, that the missionaries make a road for themselves, which they of course will keep in repair with their own money. Had, now, the Governor asked the missionaries about his plan of cleansing the roads, they would have told him how to act, and the natives would not only have cleansed our new road, but they would have done what you printed in your former number, they would have completed the remainder.

More than usual care should have been taken to soothe the alarm aroused by the rumours of German aggressiveness, and to disjoin himself from the discredit of any similar cupidity. Mr. Wigram’s communication to the press upon this subject dispels any possible inference that the noble Church Missionary Society participates in the liability for the unfortunate expedition. Mr. Thomson says that the Bishop begged the Society not to take him into their counsel, from an apprehension that he might dissuade the Society from countenancing the journey; and, indeed, the letter indicates that a protest could hardly have been of effect. Careers and deaths like Bishop Hannington’s remind a prosaic and artificial generation that the instinct of Christianity remains what it was at its foundation. There is a simplicity about men of his stamp such as there was in the leaders of the primitive Church. In their faith there is no mixture of doubt. To a man of this nature there would be a difficulty in making sufficient account of the prudential pleas in favour of a circuitous passage to Rubaga as against one in itself more expeditious. His eyes were fixed too intently on the object towards which he was bound for him to pause to weigh extraneous considerations. His resolution is to be deplored.

Since that time individual missionaries have been sent out at different intervals both from England and Jamaica. But missionary operations at present are totally insignificant compared with what they were in those times. The once flourishing mission on Fernando Po has been broken up since May, 1858, when Don Carlos Chacon\'s royal decree declared Popery to be the only religion tolerated there. A safe and quiet retreat on the continent was sought out and found, a piece of land was purchased of King William of Bimbia, seven miles from that place a small Christian settlement was commenced, named Victoria (August, 1858), and a little remnant of the broken-up church transferred to it, which remnant has been made the basis of operations, upon which a new church is now growing at a moderate pace, under the pastorate of a black missionary, who, beside his various ministerial duties, conducts a fine and flourishing day-school. Bimbia Station, seven miles from Victoria, had been almost entirely deserted. That bright light which had once burned there had about this period dwindled down to a mere spark, and would have gone out entirely but for the blessed influence of the Gospel at Victoria. Cameroons is at present the head-quarters, nominally so. The effects of missionary operations here have been in a great measure rendered ineffectual by internal discords in the church and ministry, some of which have manifested themselves in a manner which reflects anything but credit on the mission cause. Party spirits have been fostered, dissensions have been created, one especially of a most direful tendency had nearly ruined the church. It may be asked, ""What could be the cause of all this?"" Why, because the members of the church here are wholly uneducated and incapable of reasoning for themselves, and on these accounts can easily be turned about to advantage or disadvantage as the case may chance to be. Does not this circumstance reflect some disgrace on the Baptist Missionary Society, that during more than half a century\'s labour in Africa it has not been able to train up one single teacher, either in Africa or in England, capable of taking a common day-school under his own care and supervision? From Fernando Po parents have been obliged to send their children to the Church Missionary Grammar School at Sierra Leone for education. In Cameroons here the missionaries have been obliged to employ young men as teachers who can, with much difficulty spell through a verse or a paragraph, and with equal difficulty scribble a line in the most illegible hand possible, at the rate of 21l. average per annum, on the just ground that their capabilities do not entitle them to a higher salary. They have been enjoined to put aside all their other duties and attend only to those of the mission. They have promised compliance, and what has been the consequence? Their wages being so very small for the support of their families, and living so very hard, they have been unfaithful to their promise, and have clandestinely engaged either in carpentry or in the oil trade, in some instances in both. At present there is not one of them in the mission employ; they have either been dismissed or have resigned, with a view to better their circumstances otherwise. Teachers are badly wanted, and on two occasions teachers have been applied for and obtained from Victoria School (credit to the conductor of that school) for stations up here, with scarcely any remuneration beyond their feeding. One justly became dissatisfied and returned home; the other still remaining is discountenanced, and his services as a school teacher and compositor\n**35**', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'in the printing-office are not recognized by the other missionaries, excepting the one under whose direction he labours.

One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What African Missionaries Have to Go Through', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'About six months ago a party of over forty missionaries left the Mersey for St. Paul de Loanda, South-west Africa, in order to conduct their work in that district, and as far as possible into the interior. The party went out under the auspices of an American Missionary Society, and was in charge of the American M.E. Bishop Taylor. According to accounts which from time to time have been received in England, the missionaries have had to undergo terrible hardships, and the latest information shows that those of the party who are alive are in a most deplorable condition. The party, on leaving Liverpool, included men, women, and children, and were evidently totally unacquainted with the nature of the country they were going to. In a very short time after their arrival many of them were stricken down with fever, and soon death terminated the sufferings of several. The missionaries appear to have been ill-provided with funds, and although two or three of the party have returned home, they were only enabled to do so by the consideration of the English steamship companies trading to the port. A gentleman who has been engaged in trading at St. Paul de Loanda for some time past has just arrived in England, and from him some very sad facts have been obtained. So badly off were the party at latest accounts that they had sent a request to the trading houses to be given the leavings of their tables. Many of the party, if they acted on the promptings of their own feelings, would return to America, but they were afraid of being accused of acting in their own interests, and abandoning the noble work they went out to pursue.

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country. Some constitutions acclimatize with difficulty, others never; while some fall victims to fever as soon as they reach their destination, and before commencing work.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have to record in our present number another sacrifice in the cause of Africa.

Many of our readers are aware that an obstacle to the opening up of Uganda has existed in the regular route from Zanzibar, for a vast extent of very unhealthy territory has to be traversed. Mr. Joseph Thomson\'s explorations revealed an alternative road, much shorter, and altogether more suitable for Europeans. In addition to its natural advantages, the new course possesses some of a political character, for German acquisitions threaten to block the line from Zanzibar to the Equatorial lakes. Bishop Hannington appreciated the importance of keeping the quick route open for missionary communication with the interior, and he resolved to be its pioneer. Within two days\' journey of Rubaga, where the King of Uganda resides, Mr. Thomson had turned aside, seeing the full danger of proceeding further in that direction. This risk is owing to the dislike on the part of the King to intercourse by what correspondents call the ""back door.""

But it was also understood that the arrangements for the Lower Mission were provisional, and that there were other cases which might be dealt with by the new finance committee on the spot.\n\nThe English mission party went forth in February, accompanied by Bishop Crowther, who had come to England a few months before to join in the deliberations, and without whom nothing was done. In the Lower Mission, Mr. Dobinson and Mr. Bennett settled at Onitsha and Obutshi, and Mr. Eden travelled about, visiting all the stations, in some cases accompanied by the Bishop and Archdeacon Crowther. In August last, the new Finance Committee met for the first time, and had two sessions of three days each. The result was as follows: Three lay agents were disconnected, and two ordained men suspended by the Finance Committee as a body; and two ordained men were suspended by Mr. Eden on his own authority as Secretary, one of these being Archdeacon Crowther himself.\n\nThe word ""suspension"" as applied to an action of the Society means properly a prohibition from engaging in C.M.S. work pending the decision of the C.M.S. Committee. It is not an ecclesiastical matter. The Society claims no right to suspend an ordained man from clerical functions. That power appertains to the Bishop. But the Society has the right to decline to employ in its own service any one of its agents.\n\nThe power of its representatives in a mission to disconnect an agent in this sense, or to suspend him, depends upon the authority given to such representatives. In 1883-4 special powers were given to Archdeacon Hamilton, while Secretary of the Niger Mission. Mr. Eden, believing himself to have similar powers, acted in the two cases as a last resource under what he considered to be extreme circumstances. Of course the justice of the disconnections and suspensions is not affected by the regularity or irregularity of the procedure adopted. The condemnation might be just, but the procedure irregular. The procedure might be regular, but the condemnation undeserved. On these points, for the present, we express no opinion.\n\nIt was the hope of most of us here that the new arrangements on the Niger would result in a development of the mission, and would solve the problem how to unite in a common work the African and English missionary. One or two removals of existing men were expected to prove necessary, and we knew these removals would not be effected without some controversy.

That portion to which I take objection is as follows: ""We may probably take the higher estimate of £2,000,000 as being nearer the mark of the actual expenditure required than the lower, and £2,000,000, it must be admitted, is a very large sum on which to obtain a working profit from the commercial intercourse between the interior of Africa and the external world."" £2,000,000 is undoubtedly a large sum to expend at the first inception of trade development in the basin of the Upper Congo; but the gentlemen connected with the syndicate have no idea of spending such an enormous sum, or any figure approaching it, in the Congo regions. What we proposed was to have the power of increasing the capital to £2,000,000, should circumstances demand such increase. The first issue is to be only for £1,000,000; but in the event of any extraordinary expansion of trade we have reserved the power to increase the capital so as to meet the needs of trade and commerce. £52,000 is paid annually for human porterage of goods and merchandise from the Lower Congo to Stanley Pool. Considering the sparse population, this human porterage is not capable of expansion to any appreciable degree. Animal carriage is impossible unless a road suitable for wheeled vehicles be made between the landing places on the Lower Congo and the nearest landing place above Livingstone Falls. It is the sum now being paid for human porterage by the Congo State authorities and others that has been the basis of our studies. Whether a railway, turnpike, or public road be constructed, this sum must be expended on porterage, unless the French Government, the Congo State Government, and the religious missions were to retire in a body from their possessions on the Upper Congo, which, needless to say, there is very little prospect of their doing.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1886#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

Your energy, courage, enterprise, and resource have made that work a splendid and unique success, and you have shown the nations of Europe how a vast free equatorial state can be projected and realized. All must admire the wonderful diplomatic skill, the unwearied patience, and the great forbearance by which, in spite of the wild, war-like, and turbulent character of many of the tribes, you have made your way, step by step, up the Congo for a distance of 1,400 miles to Stanley Falls, in so peaceful and bloodless a manner, and no words are too strong to express the society\'s satisfaction with this feature of your work. With regard to Christian missions to the Dark Continent, it is well known and gratefully recognized that the comparatively recent impetus given to missionary work in Central Africa owes its origin in great measure to you. It was your earnest and urgent call to the Christian Church, written from Uganda in 1875, that led to the bold and splendid achievement of the Church Missionary Society in establishing their mission on the northern shore of the Victoria Nyanza. The promoters of that and similar efforts in Central Africa have sought with much respect and deference your advice in the carrying out their missionary projects—advice which has always been readily and freely given. It is in regard to your work on the Congo River, however, that the Baptist Missionary Society feels its own particular deep obligations. Owing to the jealously guarded trade interests, our efforts to push the mission into the interior were viewed with suspicion and strenuously opposed by the natives, and the missionaries of the society were forced to have recourse to the route you were opening up from Vivi to Stanley Pool. Were it not for your presence with your strong but peaceful force at Stanley Pool, it is very doubtful whether the missionaries of the society would have been able to establish their station upon its banks, or to launch their steamer upon its waters. This fact the society desires gratefully to recognize, showing, as it does, how much it owes to your work. Then again, the constant and ready aid you have given to its missionaries, the wise advice and counsel, and specially the kind and successful efforts on your part to secure to the society suitable and permanent sites for its stations on the ground of the association, and under its protection, at Leopoldville, Ngombe, Lukolela, and elsewhere, call for its warmest gratitude.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress of the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The first idea of a mission was started, in response to an earnest appeal made by Dr. Livingstone, at a meeting at Cambridge, in 1857.

Cameron and Missionaries in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Bishop of Gloucester continued his charge at Cheltenham on Wednesday, October 28. He said that assuming the prevalence of unbelief, he invited their thoughts to the question, “If this be so, why is it so?” Of the many causes which might be assigned, three seemed to claim more especial consideration; the tone and direction of recent historical criticism; deductions that had been drawn from the real or alleged discoveries of modern Science; and the moral and metaphysical difficulties which had been supposed to be involved in or connected with the fundamental doctrine of Christianity. The leading position of historical criticism had always been the same, that any narration of facts which involved the miraculous element must be regarded with the gravest suspicion. The answer roughly stated was, that the narratives of the Old and New Testaments were so essentially different in nature and character from the early and legendary narratives with which they had been compared that the presence of the miraculous element in the one suggested no just ground for concluding, merely because that element was present in the other, that the associated narrative was consequently mythical and untrustworthy. The Old Testament had these unique characteristics—first, a demonstrable continuity in the component portions, though these portions were numerous, diversified in character, and ranged over a period of a thousand years; secondly, not only the presence of prophecies which could be shown to have been prior to the events to which they referred, and to have been verified in detail by those events, but a distinct continuity in the method of those prophetic utterances as well as a convergence in their scope. Still sharper was the contrast between the New Testament and any other documents or narratives with which, as similarly involving the miraculous element, it could possibly be compared. The attempt to prove that the Gospels were drawn up as much posterior to the events as the mythical hypothesis required had finally broken down. The popular arguments derived from historical criticism would not be found to be of any real force or validity when closely examined; but unfortunately they were not closely examined. He did not wish to represent the case worse than it is, but he certainly feared that even among sober and religious persons, the number of those who felt real difficulties in reference to many things in the Old Testament was distinctly increasing, owing to the evil effects produced by historical criticism left unchallenged and unexamined. The Bishop then dealt with the still more serious effects produced by the deductions made from the real or alleged discoveries of modern Science, and alleged his belief that many scientific theories of the present day, now current and popular, would have to be modified. But while many popular theories were still utterly uncertain there remained some, as the principle of evolution apparently supported by trustworthy evidence, which seemed to militate with received opinions. He believed not merely that much of the misbelief of our own time was to be referred to the misuse of the blessings of which true Science was designed to be the minister, but that still more distinctly we might trace the prevalence of unbelief to the moral and metaphysical difficulties supposed to be involved in the fundamental truths of the Christian dispensation. The problem of the existence of evil, the still deeper problems connected with the mystery of sin’s atonement, and the dark and terrible questions connected with the doom of the impenitent—these three aspects of physical and moral evil fearfully tried the faith of thousands. Our very increased knowledge became a snare to us. The more Science displayed the wonders of the realms of nature, the further we saw into the beauty and the glory of the marvellous works of God, the more terrible seemed the difficulty connected with the power and presence of evil. What sign was there, either in the moral world or in those wide realms of the material world which Science was so mysteriously revealing to us, that there would be a new heaven and a new earth, where there would be no more suffering, no more trial, and from which every trace of moral and physical evil would have passed utterly away? ... These enigmas, which could never be answered while we yet only know in part and prophesy in part—these questions which really could only properly be met by a faith that found it easier to believe impossibilities than to doubt for one instant in the mercy and the love of God—these questions were now pressed home on us in a manner and with a frequency which was telling seriously upon the shallow, the careless, the worldly, the cold-hearted, and the doubting. They readily combined with the difficulties arising from other considerations. Each class of difficulties helped to augment the force of the others, and the result was a tendency to doubt everything. The Bishop concluded by exhorting the clergy to pray not only for truer faith in their own hearts, but for the power to bring home that faith tenderly, persuasively, and cogently to the hearts of those to whom they were appointed to minister. The evils he had enumerated could be counteracted not by arguments, which the doubting heart would always think it could answer, but by that intelligent and sympathetic mode of setting forth the truth—that demonstration of the Spirit which ever bore with it real and abiding conviction. Controversy, in the case of those circumstanced as the clergy were, did but little, but some knowledge of the difficulties to which he had alluded was year by year becoming more and more necessary, especially to those who had to minister to the cultivated and to the intelligent. There were, he feared, very many who were losing true peace of soul, and losing that love to Jesus as their Saviour and God, on which everything in this world and the world to come eternally depended. If this was so, then there was no graver duty imposed upon them than to strive, by wise and gentle teaching—by a teaching that knew well the difficulties it sought to remove, again to bring the love of Christ back into the soul, and with that love to bear back heart-belief, hope, and consolation. The only truth that would be found, when properly grasped, to bear abiding consolation in reference to deep speculative difficulties was contained in the Saviour’s own words, that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son to the end that all that believe in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. This was and ever would be found to be consolation, conviction, and light.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1876#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

However, the articles do not provide specific examples of similar efforts in Yoruba and the Niger, indicating a gap in the claim's suggestion that such initiatives could be implemented there.

They demanded the transport and marketing infra› structure, seizing the opportunity as soon as a railway line was completed. In many cases, they pioneered before the colonial governments had built bridges and feeder roads. Seed for new crops were taken from the colonial governments, from missionaries, from European farms and from Africans who were already engaged in cultivation. Cocoa and coffee are the two best known and most important of the cash crops whose extension relied mainly on African initiatives. Minor crops such as tea, tobacco and pyrethreum also bear out the same principle. Besides, Africans fought specifically for crops which were better money-earners than others. In the case of cocoa, this meant cultivating lands which were only marginally suitable. At other times, African preference precipitated a struggle against discriminatory colonial legislation. Thus, the latter part of the 1920s and the early 1930s saw a determined effort on the part of Africans in several highland areas of Tanganyika to cultivate Arabica coffee rather than hire their labour out or grow the less profitable Robusta variety. The Africans won literally by planting coffee trees faster than the colonial administration could destroy them. 10 Where peasant cultivation established itself as the hegemonic form of the colonial economy, it functioned like mines and plantations in drawing labour resources from an area much wider than the actual zone of production. Senegambian groundnut farming attracted seasonal labour from the hinterland of the Senegal and Niger rivers; cocoa in the Gold Coast and in the Ivory Coast drew upon Upper Volta; while Ugandan coffee-growers turned to Ruanda-Urundi and Tanganyika to expand output. Together, cash-crop farming and the wage labour of mines and agri› culture accounted for the overwhelming majority of Africans who partici› pated directly in the colonial economy. However, a host of other activities were generated or transformed by the new commodity relationships. It was rather late before the extensive forest reserves of the continent were seriously maximized, but an extractive timber industry arose early in Gabon and in varying degrees some such enterprise was pursued wherever forest reserves existed.

As is obvious from above, every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent, and this was attended by some significant successes. It was during the colonial period that the full mineral potential of Africa was realized and the mining industry definitely boomed, while the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. It was certainly during the colonial period that Ghana became the world's leading producer of cocoa while by 1950 farm crops were accounting for 50% of the gross domestic product of French West Africa. It should be emphasized, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has done above (Chapter 16), that in West Africa these cash crops were produced by the Africans themselves, clear evidence of their willingness and ability to adapt and respond to the right incentives. As J. Forbes Munro has shown, most of these fundamental economic changes took place during the two decades from the mid-1890s to 1914 'when the infrastructural foundations of most contemporary national economies were laid down by colonial governments and commerce between Africa and the rest of the world grew at an historically unprece› dented rate'. 17 This economic revolution had some far-reaching consequences. The first one was commercialization of land which made it a real asset. Before the colonial era, there is absolutely no doubt that huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only underpopulated but also under-utilized. The introduction and spread of cash crops and the mining industries put an end to all this. Indeed, such was the pace of the utilization of virgin forests that, in many parts of Africa, the colonial administration created forest reserves to prevent further encroachment. Secondly, the economic revolu› tion led to an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods.

Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889.

A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium.

Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

Thirty-four years later—viz., in 1754—the first coffee tree in Brazil was planted in a garden at Rio. Little by little the coffee tree found its way to all the sugar plantations, small quantities only being grown for private use. But when St. Domingo was in revolution at the close of last century, a coffee planter found his way thence to Brazil. He commenced cultivation for export. In 1808, about 40,000 sacks (160lbs. each) were exported. In 1855, Brazil supplied 2,606,424 sacks toward the civilised world\'s consumption, which amounts to about 5,300,000 sacks per annum. From that little coffee plant in the garden at Rio, one hundred years ago, nearly half the present consumption of the civilised world is now derived.\n\nNow, as coffee can be grown anywhere over thousands of miles in Africa at a short distance from the coast, and as the civilised world could even now consume double the present supply of coffee, we are justified in looking with hope and confidence to this useful aromatic berry as one of the instruments for African regeneration. Liberia is making rapid advance in its cultivation. Mr. Freeman (late Wesleyan missionary) has tried it with great success on the Gold Coast. Natal has become an exporter of it. We call the attention of Africans everywhere to this subject of the culture of the coffee tree.\n\nThe *African Times* now penetrates to every settlement on the African coast where an educated African is to be found. We call upon every reader of it in Africa to commence coffee planting, and to stimulate to coffee planting. There will be no difficulty in obtaining a market for coffee. Its cultivation will not interfere with that of any other staple. We hope within a few years to have good supplies of African coffee in our markets. We believe that a powerful company is forming for developing the resources of the great River Niger, devoting to it its entire capital and energies. Of its success, if properly conducted, and if properly supported by Her Majesty\'s Government, both of which advantages we are sure it will possess, there can be no doubt. And we have as little doubt that among the rich produce derived from the interior, coffee of the best quality will, in the course of a few years, figure in our markets in considerable quantities, with cotton and other absolute necessaries of our civilization and our manufacturing industry. We see what Brazil has done as regards coffee. But not one particle of what she has done would have been done without African labour and European capital.

It may be produced at nearly every part of the West Coast and the neighbouring interior districts. Great as the importance of the palm oil production is, we see no reason why that of coffee should not rapidly equal, and even surpass it. The Liberians have been among the first to comprehend this, and we have more than once called attention to this growing industry of the African republic. The supply of coffee is a question of the first importance for Europe, where the consumption is already very large, and might be almost indefinitely increased. Coffee, which Africa produces of such excellent quality, is an article full of promise for the republic of Liberia and every portion of the West Coast. Samples of Liberian coffee, as shown at the Great Exhibition in 1862, may be seen at the Museum of the African-Aid Society, 8, Adelphi-terrace, London.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COFFEE PLANTING IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There seems every reason now to believe that among Coffee trees those of Liberia stand pre-eminent in many essential qualities. They are vigorous, do not require to be planted at high elevations, are good bearers, and their fruit is of fine flavour. Our valued friend, and the long-tried friend of Africa and its people, Mr. James Irvine, of Liverpool, has, with a most praiseworthy assiduity, made their merits and peculiarly valuable qualities known among coffee planters in all parts of the world. Liberia owes him grateful thanks, for this coffee will undoubtedly become one of the great sources of its future wealth; and we have always felt that in calling attention to Liberian coffee, we were helping to lay the foundations of prosperity not only for Liberia, but for many other countries on the West Coast of Africa. It is therefore a matter of surprise and regret with us that, while Ceylon, the East Indies, and other long-celebrated coffee countries are competing eagerly for Liberian coffee seed and plants, we do not hear of any efforts made at other parts of the West Coast to cultivate this wealth-giver. To the Ceylon and East India planters, the obtaining a supply of germinating seed, or of plants, involves a considerable expenditure of money, owing to the great precautions that must be taken in order to insure any degree of success. But with West African people there are comparatively few obstacles in the way. There is weekly communication by the ships of the African Steamship Company, and British and African Steam Navigation Company, between Liberia and all the principal and many of the secondary ports and towns, north and south. By this means seed of good quality or plants might readily be obtained, with full instructions as to the best mode of culture, which is, however, very simple, and after the first clearing of the ground, does not involve any considerable amount of labour. Our friends on all parts of the Coast will do well to remember that coffee is an article the consumption of which is always rapidly increasing among the European peoples; so that, with the rapid growth of population, there is every reason to believe that the present remunerating prices will be sustained, however largely the production in all parts of the world may be increased. That this Liberian coffee plant may be cultivated with full success on suitable lands, even close to the sea-shore, is a peculiarity that must not be for a moment overlooked. Coffee, until this Liberian coffee became known, was a mountain tree; all our best-known coffee was produced on hill slopes, at elevations varying from one thousand to three thousand feet. But here our West African friends have a plant at their own door which every man who possesses a few acres of land may take advantage of, if he so choose. We fear, however, that the great impediment on the West Coast is that lack of realized capital which limits production and enterprise in many other valuable articles, as well as in coffee; while the ill fame, not altogether unmerited, of the Coast, with relation to the health of Europeans, acts as a bar to their bringing out their capital and settling there as planters. How greatly, then, it is to be deplored that the more or less educated Africans on the Coast have not earned for themselves that reputation for probity, diligence, and trustworthiness that would have induced and justified Europeans to trust them with the means for pursuing this profitable industry! As a general rule, deduced from experience, prudent men will not place money in African hands for employment, because they have but too well-grounded reason for fear that they would never see any of it again. There are exceptions, and these exceptions shine as brilliant lights amid the general darkness, and sooner or later such men will no doubt be sought out for managers of coffee and other plantations, to be cultivated with English capital. We cannot help feeling that there must have been something wrong in the general educational training at Sierra Leone, that the only aptitude elicited in those who have been taught is for law, medicine, the ministry, civil service under Government, mercantile and trading pursuits. No impulse whatever seems to have been given in the direction of agriculture; so that it is only in Liberia, among Africans who have received their impulse from the United States, that we hear of sugar and coffee plantations with systematized efforts. In Liberia there has been none of the demoralizing influence of a host of minor Government appointments, in which, with little actual labour, young men obtain enough for their meagre support, and to enable them to pass the greater portion of their time in town idleness. The revenue of Liberia does not offer such premiums to official sloth as does that of Sierra Leone; and the people having no money coming in from abroad, and no sources of supply except such as they create by their own labour, have had their energies happily directed to the development of the riches of their tropical soil and climate. The foundations of future wealth are thus being securely laid in Liberia; and if the efforts now making to direct to it a constant stream of self-supporting emigration from the Southern Counties of the United States should prove successful, we anticipate for it a rapid growth in wealth and influence. We would earnestly entreat the people of Sierra Leone to follow in this the example of Liberia. If there are not among them any with capital sufficient to form and work small coffee plantations on their own account, there are surely some with sufficiently trustworthy reputation among themselves to be trusted with money as directors and managers of a company, say even of only four or five thousand pounds to be employed (under the very eyes of the shareholders as it would thus be) in the formation and culture of a coffee plantation. Let them bear in mind that the success of one such enterprise among themselves will lead infallibly to other and more extensive enterprises in which, having previous success to appeal to, they would not seek in vain for British capital to assist them.

Dr. Imray, of that island, writes: \'If the cultivation of Liberian coffee be taken up in Dominica, there is a future for this little country. There are thousands of acres of splendid coffee land that might be cultivated in this island, with no fear of the white fly before the eyes of the planter, for the Liberian tree bids defiance to its attacks. There is a very eligible field for settlers here, with a little money in their pockets, who wish to cultivate coffee.\'""\n\nAs men are influenced by example, I will add, as an incentive to its cultivation in Africa, that a French gentleman residing at Cape Palmas informed me during a recent short stay there that he had a nursery of young coffee trees which he intended to plant out to the extent of forty acres, rented from the Government of Liberia at a nominal rent, and hoped, in the course of three years, to meet with a profitable return. The market at Cape Palmas had just then been cleared of all the coffee for sale by an American, who bought it at 22 cents (= 11d. sterling) per lb., an advance of upwards of 50 per cent. in value in a quarter of a century.\n\nIf my humble testimony of its delicious flavour is of any worth, permit me to state that of all the coffee I ever drank in the large coffee-consuming countries of Holland, Belgium, France, Germany, the Hanse Towns of Hamburg and Bremen, Turkey, and the United States of North America, at the Cape of Good Hope—aye, even in my own country, and on the West Coast of Africa—I bestow the palm upon Liberian coffee, not even excepting the choice bean of the Rio Nunez.

Here there is a certain amount of good trade, and there might be much more, but unfortunately, though amongst the citizens of the Republic, notably in Mr. Blyden, we find some men whose intellect and culture would fit them for any society in the world, the greater portion of the settlers from America and their descendants have not fulfilled the high hopes of those who took part in the foundation of this negro State, where, untrammelled by any fancied superiority of the whites, and saved from the contamination of vice, the negro was to prove his capability for progress and self-government.\n\nAt the same time, Liberia is far from deserving all the abuse that is lavished on it, for nowhere else on the coast of Africa do we find such evidences of civilization among negroes as here, and the faults they possess are those which are common to all civilized negroes. Their self-government has been sneered at, but it is wonderful that people without any experience should have done as well as they have. Commercial morality is not at a high standard, and more might be done in cultivation and improvement of the fertile country which is under the Liberian flag; and the Liberians would be wise if they did not insist upon negro blood being present in the veins of all their citizens. But many of the faults we see are faults of ignorance, and others arise from the bad example of whites. The coffee plantations of Liberia might be increased almost to an infinite extent, and through Liberia there should be opened up a route to the interior which would bring a large trade to the coast. Between Liberia and the French possession at Grand Bassam, on the frontier of the Gold Coast Colony, lies a long strip of coast inhabited principally by Kroomen, who trade with Bristol ships, but who will tell nothing of the interior; and hitherto the trade has been carried on by sailing ships from Bristol, which cruise up and down the coast. Till quite lately, only one or two white men have lived on shore, the places where the captains and supercargoes of the British ships landed being few and far between; but now the German flag has been hoisted over some small trading stations, and probably soon we shall find that these form pretexts for annexation to the German empire. Now that the Krooboys are so largely employed in the Oil Rivers, in the Gold Coast Colony, on board the mail steamers and in men-of-war, there should not be any difficulty in sending explorers to examine the terra incognita behind their homes, and from such examination we should reap immediate commercial advantage.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COFFEE PLANTING IN LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '[*From the Philadelphia (United States) Evening Bulletin.*]\n\nThe following extract is from a letter of an old servant, written to his former master, from Ridgeland, on the St. Paul\'s river, in Liberia.

As a general rule, cultivation always exerts a highly beneficial influence on plants, and there is no reason to believe that the coffee plant would prove to be an exception.

The Upper Mendi, Konno, and Kuranko districts furnish a wide field for commercial enterprise. Manchester woven goods and cotton have scarcely found their way there and where an article is offered which meets a felt want, it is surprising how quickly the Natives acquire it. The eastern portions of the protectorate, which consist of highlands, with a bracing and salubrious climate, are adapted for the cultivation of coffee, ginger, and other valuable products. Another means for the development of the resources of the country would be the settlement of Natives with capital from Sierra Leone and elsewhere, who would carry on such kinds of agriculture. The aborigines live only for the present; they cannot see the force of cultivating plants such as the coffee for the fruits of which they must wait for four or more years. Though slave raiding has ceased, the chiefs still exercise despotic powers, hence there is no security of tenure, and the people are discouraged from making provision for the future; but a closer control by the Government will do away with this feeling of insecurity. Already I have observed in the Sanda Lokko and other districts the cultivation of young kola trees along the approaches to the villages and towns, but this industry might be very much enlarged; and in the hands of enlightened Natives it might be made remunerative. The principal trade routes from beyond the Protectorate are those which enter it across our northern frontier through the French posts at Herimakunna and Wossu. On the eastern frontier between Herimakunna and Kanre Lahun practically no trade passes along them, owing to the deserted condition of the country. From Kanre Lahun a certain amount of trade is done with the interior at the market in the Bandeh country, but this trade is only intermittent. Along the frontier on the Liberian side from Kanre Lahun to the coast of Manoh Salija there is a constant state of warfare, and the border district is a desert. During my recent tour there appeared to be a revival of trade with the interior across our northern frontier, and the number of caravans that came down was unprecedented; but the future prospects of this trade are uncertain, and its continuance cannot be counted on, nor have the products which have come down had an effect in relieving the depressed condition of the market.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Just fifty years ago the Rev. Joseph R. Dunwell began the Methodist Mission at Cape Coast. There are now in West Africa nearly 14,000 members, whilst thousands more have safely found their rest. The Jubilee is to be celebrated by special gatherings, and also by special gifts for the consolidation of existing missions and for extension in the regions beyond. A series of most enthusiastic meetings have already been held in the Cape Coast section of the District, and a sum of £10,000 has been promised to the Jubilee Fund. This result has filled us with wonder and gladness; and, best of all, in connexion with the same meetings, scores of the heathen have renounced their heathenism and turned from dumb idols to serve the living and true God.\n\n""The mission to Ashanti has entered upon a new era. After patient waiting for more than forty years, the door has been opened and the Gospel may now be freely preached. Kumasi, and other towns equally notorious for their human sacrifices, are now occupied. In all of them mission schools and premises have been provided by the people at their own cost.

The articles also emphasize the importance of native agency in evangelization, a strategy supported by the Wesleyan Society, while acknowledging challenges such as the loss of promising youths in Sierra Leone due to mismanagement.

The Rev. Mr. Taylor has told you that the Wesleyans on the Coast of Africa are still to be compared to an overgrown child, whose period of life induces its parent to expect that it should walk, and so relieve its mother of the trouble of carrying it. I must, however, join issue with my friend Mr. Taylor, and, in doing so, ask him to take himself back to the year 1839, and contrast the present state of society with those dark and dismal times of human sacrifice and misery which owed their origin to the fact that God was not known to the heathen nor were his precepts followed by them. Now what do we see? Why, through the length and breadth of this vast protectorate chapels and missionary stations are being planted, and I bless God that I have had the honoured privilege of raising up many of those temples, and of dedicating them to that God who is alone able to accomplish the great work of spreading the religion of his dear Son. When I saw the misery and woe that prevailed in my travels through this benighted country, when I was forced to look upon the bloodstained streets of the Ashantee and Dahomey capitals, bleeding heads and mutilated bodies, rendered so to satisfy a restless Fetish, and a most depraved and senseless religion, it was then that I felt keenly the responsibility of missionary labour; it was then that I, with more earnestness than I ever before possessed, fell down at the footstool of my God and prayed for the success of missions in Western Africa. It was then that I realized fully the necessity, the urgent necessity, of planting here the religion of Jesus Christ; because I found out that no medicine, no physician, but He who died for us, and rose again for our justification, could heal so great a malady. Depend upon it, my friends, if you wish to elevate this unfortunate country, if you wish to pull down superstition, paganism, and idolatry, this, this is your only way, by supporting this noble society in raising up the cross of Christ and Him crucified—by earnestness in your prayers, and unflinching exertion in every effort, so that your goodness be not as the morning cloud or the early dew which goeth away.

For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace. The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

This may be clearly seen when looking into the number of young people brought up in that Society, and the number of promising youths brought up in the college at King Tom's Point in Freetown, most of whom would, to the society's credit, have held prominent positions in its service if a little caution and kindness had been taken and shown by those directing this Society in that colony. But, alas! through gross neglect, these promising youths, especially those composing their agents, were all discouraged and driven out of that Society, and are left entirely to their own way, through the mal-administration of those inexperienced brethren into whose hands the Committee had so confidently entrusted the entire direction of the Society in Sierra Leone. The Wesleyan Missionary Committee seem, at last, to understand the state of things, and what occasioned the losses sustained by the desertion of all their agents, and to have now resolved, not only to extend their field of labour in Africa, but also to raise up as many of these young men as may be found, knowing that they are capable, even in the highest degree, with God's assistance, of effecting the conversion of their countrymen. Would to God the Committee knew the number of promising youths brought up in the Wesleyan College in Freetown, and the unnecessary course pursued in turning them out of the Mission work! These agents could not apply to the Committee for redress, and the Society, in her report, would represent these youths as being very ungodly and undutiful indeed, as brethren on whose testimonies the Committee solely depend, report that all their agents in Sierra Leone are ungodly and undutiful men, and the matter becomes dead and inquired into no further; whilst the contrary is the case. In one of our publications in Freetown we have been able to mention that a Mr. Woode, late agent, who was unreasonably dismissed by one of their ministers, and was afterwards employed in the Customs Department in Freetown, where a liberal salary was allowed him, has been since recalled by this Society to perform catechetical duties, together with a Mr. Samuel Davis, an agent, and Mr. Harding, all of whom are now recommended to the ministry. If those who were set over the affairs of the Society in Sierra Leone had fully known their responsibility to God for the souls of those young men whom they had trained, they would have kept them in the field of labour, and would not have dispensed with their services for frivolous matters. We are also very glad to hear that the Wesleyan Missionary Society in Lagos has recalled and secured the services of the following gentlemen, viz: Messrs. W. B. George, Moses C. Hagan, John B. Deigh, and Samuel B. Taylor; the two former being placed immediately under catechetical duties. All these were students under the Rev. James Jackson Wray, James Robert, and James W. Berry, all European tutors in the Wesleyan Institution, King Tom's Point, in Sierra Leone. There is no doubt that some of these young men could have continued their labours if they had received the slightest encouragement from their superiors; but instead of this, the Committee, it was said, ordered that their services be dispensed with, because a self-supporting system was to be established. We attribute much praise and thanks to the Rev. J. Milum, of Lagos, who has been the instrument in recalling these young men to their original work. Most of them, we learn, are, or were, holding responsible positions and receiving liberal salaries in the Government and other offices in that settlement, yet they hesitated not to return when the offer was made them by that gentleman. This shows that they entertained no desire to leave the Mission service if they had only received encouragement, not thinking that it is any dissatisfaction with their secular position that prompts them to return, but that they set great value upon the work for which they were trained, and cannot rest satisfied till they are grounded in their proper element. Imagine what vast numbers of youths were trained up in the Wesleyan Missionary Society at King Tom's Point. If not more, they are equal, at least, to those trained by the Church Missionary Society in that colony. What of all these promising youths? Can we even point out half-a-dozen useful men amongst them now? Can it be possible that of over a hundred youths trained up by that Society, not one has the desire to minister in the holy Sanctuary of God, but all to be otherwise employed? We answer, No; the fault rests solely on those in the colony who wield the sway of the Society. But the Church Missionary Society seemed to maintain contrary views on this point. For a moment just throw a glance over their field of labour, and you will find that their stations are filled up by young men of their own training. There are ministers, deacons, catechists, and schoolmasters, many of whom are sent into the very heart of Africa to teach and preach the Gospel to their countrymen; and even wherever there be a European missionary, there is also an African agent to be found, as it is utterly impossible for a European to work successfully in heathen lands without assistance being rendered by native agents. Can any of these be pointed out in the Wesleyan Missionary Society? None, but a Mr. Thorpe alone. Messrs. Marke and King are picked-up men. How has this happened? Is it because students of the Church Missionary Society are much better qualified than those of the Wesleyan? Is it because young men from the Wesleyan Missionary Institution are not sufficiently intelligent to minister in these functions? or is it because the Wesleyan Missionary Committee in England has no desire that youths trained at King Tom's Point, at an enormous expense, should be made as useful as those of the Church Missionary Society? We answer, No. It is because those into whose hands the Committee had entrusted the affairs of the Society in Freetown have very greatly erred. They cared but very little for the services, labours, and welfare of their youths, and would not by any means recommend them to the notice of the Committee as deserving promotion, but rather depress them; whilst the Church Missionary Society set great value upon their youths, especially those whom they themselves have trained. We are happy indeed to find that the Wesleyan Missionary Committee at home is now looking into matters from a different point of view, and sending out a man of such a philanthropic character as the Rev. J. Milum is described to be. He, too, seems to view matters in the same light as the Committee now views them; he seems to admire young men of intelligence, values and encourages them in their labours, and manifests great sympathy when necessity requires him to do so. He seems to be aware that Europeans alone, labouring without the assistance of Africans, cannot succeed so well. For if we look at the period when Europeans only were sent out for the Christianization of the Africans, and contrast it with the period since the Bight of Benin was put into the hands of the African Bishop to Christianize, we shall find that the Gospel has more swiftly run its course through the latter. Is it not obvious in this instance that Africans are also one of the very best means to be employed in effecting the conversion of their heathen brethren? Just cast a glance over the Church Missionary stations in the Niger, and you will find that the whole are occupied by Africa's sons. What retards the progress of the Wesleyan Mission, and prevents their occupying stations in this extensive field? Were not a few men—viz., Messrs. Roach, Jackson, and others—sent down that way for the purpose about twenty years ago, perhaps before, if the Church Missionary Society made a movement there?

John Trotter, at Basingstoke.* The gentleman whose death occasioned the delivery of this sermon was Mr. James Grafton Hazeley, of Sierra Leone, an African, and a personal friend of Mr. Trotter. It was scarcely possible that such an occasion should be allowed to pass without some notice of the slanderous attacks lately made in England on missionaries in Africa, and on African converts to Christianity. Towards the close of his discourse Mr. Trotter says:—\n\n“As illustrative of the teachings of the text, let me now present you with a very brief account of the life and death of a Sierra Leone Christian. If you expect anything sensational, you will be disappointed, for he was a quiet, respectable, unassuming man, in whom we have a specimen of the quality of West African Christianity. Let this, therefore, be one reply, at least, to the foul charge, that Christianity is the curse of West Africa. It will be seen that he was not connected with our own churches, but was a member of the Wesleyan Mission Church—a church which has been, and still is, of immense good to the West Coast of Africa.”\n\nMr. Trotter then gives a concise and interesting biography of his deceased friend, who appears from early life to have been a sincere, consistent, and ardent Christian, and finishes with the following remark:—\n\n“Thus lived and thus died a Sierra Leone Christian. He was my own near neighbour in Freetown for some time. We have held sweet counsel together. His image is photographed on the tablet of my memory, never to be erased. When I was sick he visited me, and when I was in trouble he comforted me. Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my last end be like his. And here let me bear my testimony to the native Christians of Sierra Leone. With some few exceptions, greater Christian kindness I never met with from any people. I have seen them live, and I have seen them die. I have seen them in the villages, and in the larger towns. I have seen them taken out of the slave ship naked and down-troden, and I have seen them civilised, educated, and Christianized, and I have no hesitation in saying, that, taking into the account their antecedents, their religion will not lose anything by being contrasted with English Christianity. Any system, therefore, or any man who would rob them of the priceless boon of Christ and Him crucified, deserves to be buried under mountains of reproach. It would be infinite cruelty to dash the cup of salvation from their lips, now, when so many of them have tasted its sweetness; rather let them continue to drink and live for ever.\n\n“In conclusion, enough has been said to prove, that our African friend, Mr. James Grafton Hazeley, was a saint of the Most High God, that his death was safe, happy, and triumphant, and that such a death was precious or right dear in the sight of the Lord.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Why the Wesleyan Missionary Society in Freetown Dispensed with the Great Number of Youths Trained up at King Tom's Point"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'those men recalled? and what was the result of their mission?

It is rather peculiar. It is just for the same reason above set forth that they have not a foot of land on which to establish their mission in that extensive field. It is a sad and shocking reflection. Again, there are Messrs. T. E. Williams, now in Porto Novo, and J. B. Thomas in Lagos. The former laboured over twenty years, and the latter over fifteen years, as schoolmasters. If they were incompetent men, why were they not dispensed with long ago; but if they be competent and qualified men for their work, why not have promoted them long before this time? Does the colour of an African so degrade him as to incapacitate him to be a minister of the Wesleyan Missionary Society? Is there any respect of persons with God in the performance of His services? The Church Missionary Society seems to maintain a contrary opinion. Due deference should be given to Mr. Milum also in this matter, who seems also to entertain a contrary opinion, and, above all, to manifest perfect love for the African race. But for him, who would have brought these useful men to notice? To this godly and affectionate minister only, they owe their truly deserved promotions as reverend gentlemen to-day. We, however, hope that the time is now come in which better encouragements are offered to Wesleyan Missionary agents, and especially to those young men above named, who seem to have at heart a deep interest for the work of God, and come forward willingly, at Mr. Milum\'s call, for the performance of His holy duties. We trust that liberal salaries is not all that will be granted to them, but also due promotion as occasion may require and permit. By these means the Society will not suffer so much in losing their agents as they have done hitherto. We hope the encouragement intended for them will be such as may instigate their colleagues, now otherwise employed through previous unfortunate neglect, to return and labour likewise, ""the harvest being plenty, but labourers few."" We cannot close this article without acknowledging our gratitude for the course pursued by our worthy friend the Rev. Mr. Milum, now in Lagos, and attributing much praise and thanks to him.

The Wesleyan Chapel was opened for public worship on Sunday, the 9th inst. As had been before mentioned, the European missionaries, who personally parted friends with the Egbas shortly after the riot, are still considered to be out of Abeokuta; although no strong objections have been raised against their coloured agents, who are again sent to preach the Word of God in this ""Promised Land."" Very many of the Christian converts who left at the same time with the missionaries have returned home, in spite of the warm encouragements of grants of land freely made to them at Ebute Metta by the Administrator of Lagos; thereby giving us a large congregation of about 400 men, women, and children in this small chapel. I must assure you, Mr. Editor, that your letter of April 13, addressed to the Bashorun, chiefs, and people of Abeokuta, has done no end of good toward this result.

The Rev. M. Grimmer, Minister of the Wesleyan chapel (now at Lagos), has also written a fine letter of encouragement to the converts, beseeching them to unite together, instead of the petty differences and discord known to have been so long existing among them, since Mr. Jas. B. Thomas (their schoolmaster) ruled over the Ogbe chapel. Mr. Grimmer\'s letter was read to the members a few days previous to the reopening of the chapel, and has done great good in uniting them together. The chapel bell, which had been almost ten months laid aside secretly, without hope, was heard again calling to worship, at the precise hour of ten o\'clock Sunday morning; thereby filling with joy the heart of each and every member. Many an aged Christian, with tears rolling down their cheeks, came from far, in the usual slow way (step by step), to feed once more from the words of our Blessed Saviour. May the prayers of that day\'s service bring down blessings from Heaven. In the absence of a minister, and for fear of being disappointed, the members applied to the Rev. Mr. Allen, a native deacon of the Church Missionary Society here, to preach for them on this occasion. Thus the whole ceremony was ably performed in the usual ""Church fashion,"" giving general satisfaction to everybody. Mr. Allen took his text from Psalm iii. 1—6.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': 'In Southern Africa, even greater attention was paid to education than in other parts of Africa, thanks partly to the grants-in-aid that were given by the governments of the Cape and Natal during the period. It would appear that the educational activities of the missionaries had been far more successful than their evangelical activities by 1870.$^{18}$ Not only had many elementary or village schools been established but, from as early as the 1840s, teacher-training and secondary institutions were founded. The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'The missionary factor', 'content': ""Both missionary Christianity and education were also important factors which determined the course and nature of African responses to colonial conquest. The missionaries had created an African class of evangelists, teachers, journalists, businessmen, lawyers and clerks who often seemed to accept the supposed cultural inferiority of the Africans, to accept settler colonialism as a fact of life and who admired the white man for his power, wealth and technology.$^{2}$ Examples of these individuals were Tiyo Soga (1829^71), the first African missionary to be ordained by the United Presbyterian Church in Britain, founder of the Mgwali mission where he preached to both Africans and Europeans, and translator of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress into Xhosa as U-Hambo Lom-Hambi, the first book written by an African to be published by the Lovedale Press, in 1867; John Langalibalele Dube, a Methodist minister, an ardent follower of the black American educationalist, Booker T. Washington, founder-president of the Zulu Christian Industrial School, the Natal Bantu Business League and the first president of the African National Congress; John Tengo Jabavu (1859-1921), a devout Methodist, founder-editor of the English/ Xhosa weekly Imvo Zabantsundu; and Walter Rubusana, a Congregationalist minister and the only African ever elected to the Cape Provincial Council.\nIdeologically, these mission-educated Africans shared the universalism, utopianism and non-racialism of the missionaries and of the Aborigines' Protection Society. They were committed to constitutionalism, gradualism, and cultural assimilation as advocated by a few white liberals among the settlers. But they also were disciples of Booker T. Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic. They generally acquiesced in colonial expansion and conquest, partly because, like the missionaries, they associated colonialism with Christianity and 'civilization', and partly because they respected the 'overwhelming superiority' of European weapons and warfare."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Evangelical Christianity', 'content': ""Evangelical Christianity, in whose eyes the Origin of Species was damnable heresy, had no qualms, nevertheless, in accepting its racial implications.

But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible. The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

A decree to curtail labour services from the peasant was enacted in 1934, and legislation for the reform of the land tax in 1935.

However, this change did not amount to much and both countries therefore remained economically backward and socially undevel› oped.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi.

Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses.

There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks. When he started a branch of the African Orthodox Church in Uganda, the political and social purpose was clear in his declaration that the Church was '... for all right-thinking Africans, men who wish to be free in their own house, not always being thought of as boys'. Mukasa's church spread to Kenya.

A grant of 10,000 acres, situated near a civilised centre, is required as a basis. The land will be divided into ten sections of 1,000 acres each; and, upon each of these divisions, ten carefully selected and well-trained families will be located. A sum of £25,000 will be required to enable the settlers to hold out for the first three years, while adjusting themselves to their new habitat, and to pay for the land should it be found necessary to purchase it.\n\nDuring this period each head of a family would receive sufficient food and clothing for himself and his household, but would not be entitled to any further remuneration. At the beginning of the fourth year, however, an additional allowance of £30 per annum would, in like manner, be given, as it is hoped that by that time an income would be obtained from the land under cultivation. This arrangement would continue until the close of the tenth year, when the land would become the property of the people. The net proceeds of their earnings during this said period would be employed in the spread of civilisation among the Natives, and in the assisting of other enterprising Africans who were desirous of returning and settling down in their Fatherland.\n\nThe £25,000 necessary to float the scheme is not required at present. It will be raised with the help of a Committee\n\nwhen the proper time arrives. I purpose, first of all, to go, spy out, and secure the land; secondly, to proceed to the West Indies to select the first 100 families as pioneers.\n\nTo meet this preliminary expense and charges already incurred in connexion with the maturing and developing of the scheme, a sum of not less than £650 is required. About £300 of this moderate amount has already been subscribed by more than 200 highly representative friends, and further contributions are earnestly solicited from all who take an interest in the progress of the African race.\n\nSubscriptions can be sent to the Treasurers—Edward P. Thomson, Esq., W.S., 76 George Street, Edinburgh; and Alexander Breingan, Esq., Bank of Scotland, Helensburgh, N.B.—who will duly acknowledge the same. The name and address of each subscriber, together with the amount given, will then be entered in one of the official books, specially provided for the purpose. As soon as the necessary sum is obtained, a printed list of all the subscriptions will be published, along with a statement of the expenditure, and a copy sent to each subscriber.'}]","[{'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns. We are glad to see that a prominent place is given to Africa and her children in the contemplated disposal of it. The following is from the monthly organ of the Society: ""It was deeply felt by the Committee that the hope for the evangelization of Africa must mainly rest on the employment of a native agency. The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life. At the same time, on every mission in Western and in Southern Africa there have been found native converts who have been deemed suitable to be employed as teachers among their countrymen. Some of these have been honoured of God with great success. It is desired that means may be provided for the training and employment of a much larger number of native African agents; and that at important centres, hereafter to be selected, schools or institutions should be formed for that purpose, to be commenced and sustained by an appropriation from the Jubilee Fund. In contemplation of the vastness of the field of labour in Africa it will be admitted that a large amount may with propriety be consecrated to this service.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '*at foot,* from the missionary paper of Abeokuta, is a tardy, but a powerful justification of the views of the African-Aid Society. Written apropos of frequent fires in Abeokuta, and of the want of some non-inflammable material for the roofs of the air and light-excluding native hut, the writer shows how slowly the system hitherto pursued works for material improvement, and the need of efforts in an industrial direction: ""It is quite a question whether skilled labour should not in good policy take the lead, and reading and writing follow after, if not in point of time, yet in point of importance."" And again: ""Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance. It is difficult, as experience proves in the few efforts already made, to communicate hand knowledge, but where the welfare of a country is considered, difficulties should be less thought of."" The African-Aid Society and the African Times have never spoken out more strongly than this. Truth will make its way, in spite of prejudice and jealousy. The ""native who returned from the Brazils,"" and who was sent out to Abeokuta under the auspices of the African-Aid Society, gives a faint foreshadowing of the material advancement in Africa that will some day result from the return of the African race in America to the lands of their forefathers. Had not some of the missionary body in Abeokuta opposed the sending of such people from America by the African-Aid Society, many brick and tile makers, and other valuable artisans, might now have been established there. We are glad to see that a change is coming over the spirit of our friends in that place. America will soon have many choice workmen and agriculturists from among its emancipated slaves, ready to bring their industrial knowledge to the assistance of the land of their forefathers. There are representatives there of every African race on the West, and of many races on the East Coast. Meanwhile we must all, Government and people, do the best we can, wherever British authority is in any way acknowledged, to introduce into the country those improvements in means of intercommunication, in dwellings, in tillage, and in mechanical arts, that civilization in Europe and America has acquired, and by which alone civilization can progress. We repeat our belief that coloured artisans from America are valuable, if not indispensable, for this work.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Macaulay prefaced his remarks on ""England and her West African Colonies"" by stating that he hoped to be able to prove, in the course of his essay, the success attendant upon the ecclesiastical, political, and commercial efforts of British enterprise in the West African Colonies of England, and to picture their early history with the stubborn realities existing at the present time. Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large.

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The available evidence leads to the conclusion that the progress of Islam in Central Africa is more rapid than it is in India.

There is much independent testimony to the same effect. Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual.""

The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached.

In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic.

As one report from the Gold Coast put it, by 1850, the young men had gone to reside in the interior as traders and clerks and it was they who were 'causing a great increase in the consumption of the manufactures ofGreat Britain and are widely extending commerce and civilisation amongst the native population'.34 Similar social developments took place in Madagascar and in Central and East Africa. Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Christianity in the colonial era', 'content': ""The African response to the missionary endeavour expressed itself in three distinct ways: acceptance, rejection and adaptation. There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley.

For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""Indeed, Afro-Americans in the nineteenth century were exhorted to assume a special stance toward the 'redemption' of African societies.

In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas.

At two p.m. the bell again calls the children to school; at three p.m. the people to church; and at seven p.m. an examination of the children takes place in the mission-house.\n\nAs I have already noticed that the Rev. Mr. Robb is translating the Scriptures, notwithstanding, he often preaches, and is always present at the different sacramental tables; he seldom fails travelling ten to twelve miles on the Sabbath to preach amongst the inland plantations. This is hard work in a climate like that of Western Africa. The rest of the week is spent by the missionary in holding nightly meetings, and by travelling to the surrounding villages preaching and administering medicines to the sick, and giving consolation to the dying; he must also superintend the building and other alterations which might require at the station.\n\nDuring all this time the missionary ladies have their part to play upon the stage of civilisation.

There were several friendly chiefs, especially the Chief of Anyako, where they have a station. The young people spoke about robbing the missionaries and the factory of Messrs. Victor and Sons, but the chiefs put them right by showing them how their country derives nothing but good from them; how they have come to them and trusted themselves to their protection, and how they educate their people, &c. Thus all the property of the mission, the full stores of the factory, and, before all, eight or ten valuable lives of our brethren, were spared.

What would these gentlemen—who say that Mohammedanism and polygamy is the only form of religion which could benefit the nigger—be if their forefathers had not embraced Christianity? They would be as savage as these despised people are now, and perhaps more degraded still, considering the energy by which the Saxon race is known to act in good and in evil.\n\nAlso at Addah the factory of Victor and Sons was quite safe under the protection of the chief of Addah, and not a pin\'s-worth was stolen, because this chief is on very friendly terms with the missionaries at Kroboe, who visit the town from time to time.

With the utmost barefacedness and audacity he proceeded to Morokwain, whither Mr. F. had gone. He had already heard, by a despatch, of Nelson\'s conduct, and felt it his duty to demand he should at once return with him to Motito or Kuruman to be judged. Finding Nelson unwilling, he sought the assistance of the chief man of the place to compel him to do so. Mr. F., with a number of people, went to Nelson\'s waggon, for the purpose of insisting on his going; and he, finding that resistance was useless, waited till Mr. F. came near the waggon, when he ignited about 175 pounds of gunpowder. Nelson himself was blown to atoms, whilst Mr. F. and several of the natives (the number is uncertain) lay like a heap of cinders on the ground behind where the waggon had stood, his boots being all by which Mr. F. could be distinguished from the natives beside him.\n\n""Thus perished a servant of God, beloved and valued alike by his brethren in the mission field, and by the natives whose privilege it was to be watched over by him, and to be taught the way to that home to which he himself has been so suddenly and unexpectedly taken.""\n\nWe regret to say that the wretched man who thus ended his career of vice was not a solitary instance of the degradation exhibited in the character of European travellers in South Africa. In one of his latest reports Mr. Moffat gives, in few words, a dark picture of this class of men, who, by their example, teach the natives the most appalling forms of vice and misery, and then return home, and, by their malicious misrepresentations, strive to vilify the good name of their countrymen, who are toiling with self-denying perseverance for the social and religious elevation of the aborigines.

Before going into these details it will prove no less interesting than useful in the proper understanding of the situation to briefly sketch the early history of this infant settlement. Nearly forty years ago, the Rev. Alfred Saker, one of the missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society, purchased land at Cameroons, being driven out by the Spanish authorities from Fernando Po at the instigation of the Jesuits, and commenced mission work there. At that time the natives were cannibals, and no attempt whatever had been made to civilize them. All the civilization that exists in the Cameroons district to-day is the result of the operations of the missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society. This Society has spent over £100,000 sterling, and not a few noble lives in connexion with this enterprise, and they therefore feel they have great interests at stake in this district, and, as may be supposed, their missionaries are greatly beloved by the natives. It may also be well to explain in connexion with recent events, that the cession of territory to the German authorities was made by King Bell, the chief of Bell Town, who not only ceded his own territory but Joss Town and Hickory, both these towns being under the chieftainship of another headman named Joss Chief, who was absent from the river at the time of the transaction. On his return he discovered, to his intense chagrin and vexation, that King Bell had not only ceded territory which did not belong to him, but that he retained for himself the whole of the large sum of money which he received from the German authorities for the purchase of his sovereign rights. The Chief of Joss Town therefore resolved not to recognize the transaction, and, so far as I am informed, he intimated to the German authorities that King Bell had no right to cede either Joss Town or Mortonville.""}]","[{'document_title': 'MR. JOSEPH THOMSON ON EUROPEAN INTERCOURSE WITH AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Joseph Thomson, the African explorer, lectured at Edinburgh, on January 11, on ""The result to the African of European intercourse."" There was a large attendance.\n\nThe Lecturer, after observing that one of the most remarkable features of the century had been the phenomenal interest displayed in all things African, and that people\'s imaginations had been touched by the varied story of the Dark Continent, drew attention to the apparently unselfish form of the public interest manifested in Africa. The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In that letter Mr. Rosenbush, who has been eighteen years resident at Sierra Leone, states, as an incontrovertible fact, that missionary efforts have produced very beneficial results—that the most cursory comparison of the people of Sierra Leone, composed in a great measure of Africans liberated from the holds of slave-ships, with the natives of places where the influence of missionaries is not known, will establish this without dispute. We refer our readers again to his letter on this very important point, because we feel that as the past has depended, so the future must in no small degree depend, on this of late most calumniated body of men. Whatever may be the other measures adopted for the advancement of Africa, any relaxation of the efforts of missionaries would be a result deeply to be deplored by every one who is looking and labouring for the day of African regeneration. Mr. Rosenbush\'s views so intimately coincide with our own as to the means by which ""improvement and civilization"" may be best advanced in the colony of Sierra Leone, that we may be excused again entering largely upon them at this time. The agricultural improvement of the colony demands the special attention of Government authorities; and when, as in this case, a means is pointed out which only requires a better disposal of the revenues raised in the colony itself, by making them instrumental in obtaining reproductive results from the enforced labour of the criminal portion of the population, instead of that labour being wasted, as at present, no trivial objections or inapplicable theories ought to be allowed to stand in the way of its adoption. There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil. As Christian civilization had to be introduced from Europe, so must the impulse to agricultural industry be introduced from Europe also.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

When we reflect that it is only five-and-thirty years since the debasing chain of slavery was removed from those of the African race in Barbadoes, and that this man, born within ten years after, should have thus wrung from French, Germans, and Englishmen such high and well-deserved tributes of loving gratitude, admiration, and praise, we experience a fresh stimulus to exertion for Africans in Africa to effect, as soon as possible, that every impediment to their progress in Christian civilisation may be removed, that every badge of their supposed inferiority shall be obliterated, and that institutions shall be planted among them calculated to foster and develop that worthy spirit of emulation to rival their European brethren which we regard as a powerful spring of action in the coming regeneration of Africa; and it does seem to us that both Sierra Leone and Lagos, which are the, at present, chief points of civilised commercial development on the West Coast, ought to lose no time in erecting in Sierra Leone and in Lagos a column on which shall be from time to time inscribed the names of those of the African race in whose favour the world may pronounce, as in the case of the late lamented Dr. Davis; and of others whose future services to Africa, in Africa and elsewhere, may, by universal acclaim among them, be deemed worthy to be had in undying remembrance, as worthy of honour and imitation by their brother Africans.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1870#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Social Conditions of the Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Zinkgraf also enters into the missionary question. He thinks the success of the missionaries in these regions is extremely small; the most they have to show in their schools is a negro of more modest behaviour, speaking some European language fluently, able to read and write, and rather more worthy of trust than his black brethren, not because he has become a ""true Christian,"" but because he has acquired some knowledge of morality and principles of truth and justice,—which things are the foundations of civilization, and have no special need of a Divine revelation. It is work which teaches him his value and the aim of his existence. ""This method is more practical than an education which relies principally on spiritual means, and is resorted to by the French Catholic missionaries; while the last-mentioned is the method of the English Protestants. The Catholic education tends to accustom the negro to regular and earnest work, and to acquire knowledge which he can turn to account. The English missionaries are apt to think themselves better than others because they consider schools and prayer of the highest importance. I do not wish to criticise these men, but I believe that outer form is with them too prominent, and they are too content if only their school-children can say a great many verses. A Catholic missionary at Saint Salvador told me that he did not dare to make his school-children work, because they did not do so in the English mission, and if he had insisted on it the children would naturally prefer the English. But in the Catholic missions generally the children are kept to work and accustomed to obedience, so that their relation to the whites is more or less that of the negroes in general, while the English missionaries treat them more like pets. The Catholic missionary teaches his religion practically and agreeably to circumstances, while the English missionary revels too much in intoxication of devotion.\n\n""As to the success of the missionaries in general, it must be said that, considering the sacrifices made, and the means employed, it is very small . . . though the missionaries themselves may perhaps think the contrary. But it is not to be supposed that, in the Coast district and the regions where the negroes have long associated with Europeans, and have been spoiled by them, their social position will ever be changed and improved by the missionaries alone."" Dr. Zinkgraf considers the members of the new Congo State to be the men destined to have a true and lasting influence on the social condition of the negroes, which ""will be affected not only by the laws of the new State, but also by the new European element that will be brought into the country.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

They must not if they could, and they ought not even if they wanted. They had laid themselves under an overwhelming load of debt to the African that centuries of beneficial work could never repay, and it would be well if they heard less about high-sounding words, schemes for the suppression of the African slave trade, and more practicable proposals for the stoppage of their equally ruin-working commerce in spirits and weapons of destruction. He might be disposed to join with such as demanded their withdrawal from Africa if it were not that on all sides he saw signs of hope, signs of the approach of a brighter day and of brighter things for the negro.

To distant people, we form one of the most intelligent and civilized portions of Africa, who, although not under a European Government, are enjoying as much of their influence as if we were born civilized. But to have a proper knowledge of the cotton tree, it is necessary to approach it more closely, when it will be discovered that it is full of thorns. This is the only way I can contrast what our country is with what it is considered to be. Our country is, undoubtedly, a great port for the palm-oil trade; and it appears to me that the only influence existing is that of raking and draining it of every speck of oil that could be got—and nothing more. Sordid avarice and insatiable gain is their only and chief aim. We own that we are poor, ignorant, heathen people, and, perhaps, vile savages too, as we are often styled; but we cannot feel more happy than when we have Europeans among us, whose goodness we feel proud to copy and imitate. I do not think that the days of contraband, when man formed the chief article of trade among us, were worse than ours—the period when lawful commerce takes the lead, and the Christian religion regulates its progress. Trade, from the way it is carried on, has a rather debasing effect on us; religion, from the stingy manner it is introduced and its principles engrafted, tends to steep us in a twofold ignorance, almost as dark as that in which it found us; so that the only improvement resulting from the advantage both of commerce and religion among us, at present, is a low cunning and a doggish reverence. People whose ears are accustomed to hear the fair carol of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in our country through European influence and missionary efforts, might be constrained to denounce my observations as a slander: but if they know the truly meaning of multum in parvo, and how it is unscrupulously practised by their agents abroad, I need not labour to convince them. I do not ignore the fact that faithful workers have from time to time been sent to our country, and that, through them, we should have been better; but the thing is this, those already in the field informed them, ""When you go to Rome, do what Rome does."" The merchant, whose only ambition is to hoard up all he could rake from the negro\'s hide, grins with pleasure and satisfaction at his wretchedness, contrives new methods of aggravating humanity, and uses all his subtle skill in advocating, if possible, the total extinction of the vague, glimmering twilight that shines around us; and the missionary, as a rule, teaches the black man hardly anything beyond the Bible, transcribed in his own tongue. In one of their conferences, held at Gaboon, the missionaries have decided not to give us and our children any intellectual training. We keenly feel the result of such selfishness, not only for ourselves, but for our children and children\'s children. How painful it is to think that there is not a single youth in our country who is capable of being more than a menial servant in any of the European establishments here! Why is it so different at Bonny, at New Calabar, at Brass, and throughout the Niger territory? It is thirty-six years ago now since a mission was planted in our midst; yet we do not present a brighter aspect than that of a dilapidated and neglected plantation. There is nothing of civilizing industry introduced into the country whereby to profit our youths; whereas in the Niger Mission—which is working exclusively by native agency, headed by its Bishop, and a grand train of clerical and lay assistants—industrial training is incorporated with the work. To every mission-station in the Niger is appended a first-class boarding-school, the pupils of which are fit to teach the teachers whom the Mission here laboured so arduously to produce. The Niger is able to furnish herself with a good staff of able and competent artisans, interpreters, clerks, and teachers; and is getting up a theological institution to train their own men.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As we have often exposed European misconduct in these countries, we may be allowed to quote F.R.G.S. on the same subject: ""There are about 100 Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent fellows, but—it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulatto.

It would appear that the educational activities of the missionaries had been far more successful than their evangelical activities by 1870.$^{18}$ Not only had many elementary or village schools been established but, from as early as the 1840s, teacher-training and secondary institutions were founded. The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Christianity served a similar purpose, providing a cultural framework for creating a Creole society out of disparate groups of peoples settled in Freetown and surrounding villages, as in various settlements on the Liberian coast, or in Libreville, Freretown, and other freed slave settlements.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'The missionary factor', 'content': ""Both missionary Christianity and education were also important factors which determined the course and nature of African responses to colonial conquest.

They were committed to constitutionalism, gradualism, and cultural assimilation as advocated by a few white liberals among the settlers. But they also were disciples of Booker T. Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic.

Among them were pioneers not only in the Christian ministry, as illustrated by such celebrities as Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther and Reverend James Johnson (otherwise known as Holy Johnson) in the Nigerian region, but also many other less famous individuals who worked on African languages, printing, publishing, building and other occupations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The neglect of technical and industrial education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and the consequent love for white-collar jobs also created among the educated folk disdain for manual labour and agricul› tural work which is still with us.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

Mr. Farler cannot be blamed for carrying the war into Dr. Lenz's own territory. Travellers are the favourites of the period; and in no career are the prizes more abundant and brilliant. All the world admires the traveller. The missionary, whom few admire, and certainly not the general public, may think it hard that a casual visitor, whom probably he has aided and befriended, should be listened to as if he were Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools when he informs Europe that African missionaries are worthy people who do a great deal of harm. An Englishman who exiles himself to Central Africa enjoys few of the compensations within the reach of the African traveller. He suffers a hundredfold the privations, and he has to wrestle with a barbarism which may be perverted into something worse by undigested education and proselytism. It would not have been surprising had an African missionary, who has resigned the advantages of civilization and attractive prospects in his own land, infused some bitterness into his retort to a rather too magisterial condemnation of his whole object in life. But the real question remains, whether the charge be true, whoever brings it. The opinion of most who examine the evidence will probably be that any large _dictum_ to the purport that missionary work in Central Africa is all illusory is a gross exaggeration. From unimpeachable testimony it is clear that missionary settlements in the country are bearing fruit, whether much or little. Negroes are actually redeemed from debasing sensuality, superstition, and indolence. There are missionary villages in Central Africa which would compare favourably with many English hamlets. The picture Mr. Farler draws of his own station is corroborated by a body of independent testimony, and it demonstrates the accomplishment of marvellous results in a dozen years. Attention there is fully paid to the primary duty of teaching the native the virtue of regular industry, which he had unlearnt through the excessive complaisance of nature. So long as the effort is sustained there can be little doubt that the beneficial effects will go on, and that the individuals subjected to this process will lapse no oftener than professing Christians in Europe and America.\n\nThere seems to be no ground for questioning the soundness of the influence of British Protestant Missions, so far as its scope extends. In Central Africa, as elsewhere, English missionaries are tempted to adopt too precisely English models and ideas, which require constant English supervision to be kept in working order.

We refer our readers again to his letter on this very important point, because we feel that as the past has depended, so the future must in no small degree depend, on this of late most calumniated body of men. Whatever may be the other measures adopted for the advancement of Africa, any relaxation of the efforts of missionaries would be a result deeply to be deplored by every one who is looking and labouring for the day of African regeneration. Mr. Rosenbush\'s views so intimately coincide with our own as to the means by which ""improvement and civilization"" may be best advanced in the colony of Sierra Leone, that we may be excused again entering largely upon them at this time. The agricultural improvement of the colony demands the special attention of Government authorities; and when, as in this case, a means is pointed out which only requires a better disposal of the revenues raised in the colony itself, by making them instrumental in obtaining reproductive results from the enforced labour of the criminal portion of the population, instead of that labour being wasted, as at present, no trivial objections or inapplicable theories ought to be allowed to stand in the way of its adoption. There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil. As Christian civilization had to be introduced from Europe, so must the impulse to agricultural industry be introduced from Europe also. The ""germ of improvement and civilization"" now ""lies,"" as Mr. Rosenbush most truly says, ""in Africa, and Africans themselves, aided by European direction, could be the constructors of their own social improvement.""

The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life. At the same time, on every mission in Western and in Southern Africa there have been found native converts who have been deemed suitable to be employed as teachers among their countrymen. Some of these have been honoured of God with great success. It is desired that means may be provided for the training and employment of a much larger number of native African agents; and that at important centres, hereafter to be selected, schools or institutions should be formed for that purpose, to be commenced and sustained by an appropriation from the Jubilee Fund.

To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth.

We are told that it is now more than fifty years since the missionaries have been on this coast, and that the missionaries are greatly complaining of seeing no success in their work. But we found it otherwise. There is very much done in these fifty years, especially in the second to the fourth decenary. The missionaries know themselves how many congregations they have, and how many members of whom they cannot say that all are chaff. Besides there are lots of healthy houses built, the whole Bible, and other useful books are translated into these languages, so that our present missionaries need no more ""to pick up the languages word by word from the thick lips of the negro with great difficulty!"" A whole staff of native assistants is formed, whose help our missionaries should better acknowledge.

Why so? Because ministerial discord and dissension are at the bottom of it. One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Social Conditions of the Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Zinkgraf also enters into the missionary question. He thinks the success of the missionaries in these regions is extremely small; the most they have to show in their schools is a negro of more modest behaviour, speaking some European language fluently, able to read and write, and rather more worthy of trust than his black brethren, not because he has become a ""true Christian,"" but because he has acquired some knowledge of morality and principles of truth and justice,—which things are the foundations of civilization, and have no special need of a Divine revelation. It is work which teaches him his value and the aim of his existence. ""This method is more practical than an education which relies principally on spiritual means, and is resorted to by the French Catholic missionaries; while the last-mentioned is the method of the English Protestants. The Catholic education tends to accustom the negro to regular and earnest work, and to acquire knowledge which he can turn to account. The English missionaries are apt to think themselves better than others because they consider schools and prayer of the highest importance. I do not wish to criticise these men, but I believe that outer form is with them too prominent, and they are too content if only their school-children can say a great many verses. A Catholic missionary at Saint Salvador told me that he did not dare to make his school-children work, because they did not do so in the English mission, and if he had insisted on it the children would naturally prefer the English. But in the Catholic missions generally the children are kept to work and accustomed to obedience, so that their relation to the whites is more or less that of the negroes in general, while the English missionaries treat them more like pets. The Catholic missionary teaches his religion practically and agreeably to circumstances, while the English missionary revels too much in intoxication of devotion.\n\n""As to the success of the missionaries in general, it must be said that, considering the sacrifices made, and the means employed, it is very small . . . though the missionaries themselves may perhaps think the contrary. But it is not to be supposed that, in the Coast district and the regions where the negroes have long associated with Europeans, and have been spoiled by them, their social position will ever be changed and improved by the missionaries alone.""

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support?

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed. No wonder, then, that religion was, to the black man, invested with the garment of a trade, and this investment proved against the white man, in return, the greatest hindrance to progress and improvement."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Their very religion proves not to be at all times an entire conversion, for a lurking regard for their old grugrus and fetishes too frequently shows an uncertainty in the religion they have newly adopted. If in religion this difficulty is found, so in their moral and social culture it must equally, nay, more, prevail. But the young, the young can surely be trained in a way to become useful to their fellow-creatures, and cultivators instead of incumbrances of the social soil.\n\nIt has struck me more than once that an anomaly exists, taken advantage of to his own detriment by the black man, and proving a fruitful source of hindrance to the white. *Trade, trade, trade,* in a limited and exceptional view, is the absorbing idea of the black man's mind. If the old man himself can't trade, he will try to do it by and through his children; and hence the cause of continual complaint that children are early removed from school when they were but beginning to learn, and too young to be confirmed in the principles of their moral training.\n\nThese difficulties have been often started, but has any remedy been hitherto suggested? If it has, where is it now in operation, and what is its result? Is the complaint removed? If so, why is it that one hears of these difficulties still existing, and proving an almost insurmountable barrier to further progress.\n\nBut I respectfully submit that the remedy is as simple, and as clear as simple. The body, or the moral culture of the mind that guides it, must be adapted to its future life.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa.

The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies.

The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley. The itinerant Liberian prophet, William Wade Harris, travelled through the Ivory Coast and the Apolonia District of the Gold Coast between 1910 and 1915 and converted some 100 000 people.

From the earliest days of the process of presenting Christianity to Africans, some converts had accepted the new faith lock, stock, and barrel. Others, on the other hand, accepted it on the basis of what they already knew, and understood Christianity in terms of the basic underlying concepts of African traditional religion, relating the message of the Church to their enduring religious needs.\nThus Christianity did not come merely to supplant traditional religious beliefs and practices, rather it came to supplement them. In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious. This is why we have termed it indigenous Christianity.\nUnderlying indigenous Christianity is an expression of religious crea› tivity and cultural integrity, and not a mere reaction, response or adaptation to outside stimuli, as some scholars are wont to assert. Usually, and with a few exceptions, the explanation for the emergence and proliferation of movements of indigenous Christianity has been derived from factors outside these movements themselves which has given them a functional reasonableness or a dysfunctional aberrant quality. Such interpretations may not be devoid of validity but they tend to overstress the role of outside factors in the emergence of these movements. Thus when they are called 'independent' churches, the underlying suggestion is that there is some more important reference point outside these churches.\nHaving taken the bold step of grafting Christianity on to the African 38.

We know how to excuse much of the opposition we encountered. The moral atmosphere of but too many places on the West Coast was so tainted, that Europeans had for the most part thrown off all those restraints which in their own countries they would have acknowledged. Official and unofficial life were pretty much on a par; and it could not be expected that the educated natives should have been able to free themselves from the influence of a baneful example. But for missionary labour, a true picture drawn of our West African settlements would have been revolting and disgraceful indeed. Into this dark arena we descended, fully conscious as regards the combats we should have to sustain. But we had faith in the influence of light. If we could only flood that arena with the light of public opinion, we felt that sooner or later our adversaries, the enemies of Africa, strong or feeble, must change their skins, or slink into holes and corners where they might hide. Consequently, the more we have been opposed, the more light we have endeavoured to throw in. And we enter upon the fourth year of our laborious combat with increased resolve, if that indeed were possible, to leave no Christian effort unemployed for the complete defeat of those auxiliaries of evil which have so long run riot in Africa—to strive to the uttermost for the introduction of all those aids to industrial development and material progress that can be made to work in union with Christianity, by which alone a moral regeneration may also be obtained.'}, {'id': 453, 'article_title': 'AFRICA AND HER EVANGELIZATION', 'full_section_title': 'AFRICA AND HER EVANGELIZATION', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_09_1864', 'content': 'From this general view of Africa let me now descend somewhat to the particular, and I know no more interesting parts to take for illustration than those which first benefited in the emancipation of the slave, and in the experience of a system of fair dealing and protection sanctioned by the Government of Great Britain.\n\nSingular has been the happiness of our country in the effect which its judicial interference has had in Negroland. No system, however, is so perfect but that improvement can be suggested; no principle is so fully and entirely sustained but that breaches of it may be perceived. It is a lamentable fact that amongst our own people are found traders whose merchandise is in men, whose principle of trading is that of overreaching and deceit, and whose bearing is arbitrary and tyrannous. The system of Government adopted is particular, and not general, so that nowhere is the character of the British nation uniformly and adequately shown. The happiness of our country still is singular, and I am one of those who look with confidence to the restoration of the negro to the society of his brethren, and that under the influence of British rule and the persuasion of Christianity.

Do they reach the wants, do they overcome the difficulties, do they apply sufficiently to the circumstance, time, and place.\n\nThe first means I would allude to are those the object of which is education, moral and religious. Education must have reference to the position of the educated; and where morality and religion are combined in the system, the latter has particular relation to the soul; the former to the body. The soul must be educated and instructed by those foundation principles of salvation that remain for ever unshaken. Our societies are diligent and earnest in the prominency they give to this all-important subject. The soul of man is everywhere the same, in the same otherwise hopeless state, in the same necessity of the same salvation. The same instruction therein applies equally everywhere. But in the instruction afforded to the soul, is the body to be neglected; nay, is the same education equally advantageous for the body everywhere? Just as the food of man is made to vary with the climate and position, so I contend that education for the body should have especial reference to the time and the occasion.

To influence the lives of a people to whom these principles were once unknown belongs to Christian education so begun. One of the greatest helps a people can offer to those who would teach them the ways of civilised life is the encouragement held out by the natives themselves towards the work they are anxious to accomplish. ""Come over and help us"" is the recorded invitation to the early Apostles, from a country that had not yet heard more than a rumor of the new religion. Some of the readers of the African Times may already suspect that the locality of Cape Coast Castle is in the present writer\'s mind. Its especial claim to help arises from the anxiety of the native chiefs to see an increase of English influence diffused among their people. The means to procure what they desire appear to be within the easy grasp of such as desire to obtain them. If the merchants of the district had no higher aim than the profit of their mercantile traffic, they would find that was aided by the employment of educated labourers rather than uneducated men. Education does not necessarily consist in the knowledge of so many words, or languages, or sciences. Education is rather the rousing of latent mental and perceptive power, so as to make it available for common life. In this lowest estimate of education it is profitable to an African employer by giving him more intelligent service than he has been accustomed to expect; the work is better done by an artisan or clerk who performs it intelligently than by one who only acts on his own unawakened powers in the matter. This argument can be pursued in reference to the further diffusion of education for the practical purposes of life among the natives, both male and female, on the Gold Coast. There is also an extended district to be affected by the establishment of an English system of teaching for both rich and poor who desire to seek such advantages, and who are hindered by distance from seeking in England the education they covet. The English system of teaching proposed in reference to Cape Coast Castle has for its especial object the Christian education of the native women and girls of that country. These need help; every one who has devoted thought and labour in the work of education knows that the women of a people exercise great influence either for good or evil. It is a dreadful truth in connexion with the French Revolution of the last century, that the degraded women were far more furious in their cruelties and their sins than the men of the same epoch. The women and girls, then, should be the especial objects for Christian education where it is begun as something new amongst them; and there are many native and other merchants, as well as influential men, who are wishing to see remedied this evil of ignorance among the females of the land. Raise the women, and the whole community will in a few years be raised in social, moral, and, above all, in religious character. St. Paul wrote of the refined heathens of civilised Rome, ""They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator."" Civilization is not rightmindedness; idolatry is the sin of the natural heart untrained to seek for spiritual influences. The young female mind is impressive to truth. Faith, it has been said, is more easy to the clinging nature of a woman than to the more vigorous will and understanding of a man. The holy precepts of the Bible must be the foundation of all that is to advance and improve the native character of the African; and who shall measure the result on the civilization and well-being of the country arising from the tiny seed of first principles implanted in the young, and nourished by practice and by example in all that is holy, and just, and true? Dr. Johnson once said, ""Whatever causes the past or the future to predominate over the present raises us in the scale of thinking beings."" This is the key-note for us to strike in order to dispel ignorance.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""CHRISTMAS-DAY AND NEW YEAR'S DAY."", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that will have closed before this paper can reach the hands of our African readers has been one marked by great and important events in Europe, which, as the chief field of Christian profession, may naturally be expected to undergo startling and terrible visitations as the world draws nearer and nearer to that end to which we have pointed. Among the political events we are inclined to regard that which has cast down thrones in Germany, and seems to be culminating in a new German Empire, as chief in menace and in promise. It has roused strong animosities, and may lead to new combinations of powers for working out those changes which are coming upon the earth. We have no prophetic spirit—we do not profess to know what even a day or an hour may bring forth; but we feel, and we hope that all our friends both in Europe and in Africa will feel with us, that these are times in which we cannot be too zealous in the performance of those works which have been given us to do. We know that our work is to bring all the forces that we can command to bear for promoting and furthering the Christian civilization of Africa. And if this duty is ours, how much more evidently is it that of every educated African. There is no hope for Africa but in that civilization, as there is scarcely an educated African anywhere who does not owe the education he has received directly or indirectly to Christian effort on behalf of him and of his race. The governing authorities would have left him everywhere in the thraldom of ignorance and degrading superstition, even when freeing him from absolute bodily slavery to his fellow-man; but various Christian organizations have, in obedience to the Divine command, come forward in his behalf and to his rescue, with results which are scoffed at and derided only by those who would have used his race for ever as victims of their interests, and of all those evil passions by the indulgence of which they who are not Christ\'s work out the devil\'s work on earth. This very fact, even supposing no love of Christ in his heart, no religious feeling to have been generated in or brought home to him with the knowledge he has received, ought not only strongly to impress every educated African with a sense of duty, but to show him clearly and unmistakably in what direction his path of duty lies. In striving to advance his own individual earthly interests, whether in science, trade, commerce, agriculture, or manufacture, let him keep constantly in view that all he has received by which he has been made to differ from the most filthy and degraded of the savages of his race, is the fruit of advancing Christian civilization, and of that alone; and keeping this in view he will not, and cannot, fail in combining with exertions for his own personal advantage and aggrandisement, equally constant and strenuous efforts for the spread of that same civilization on the continent and in the islands which he inhabits. European Christians have begun the work among the Africans, and they will not abandon it; those to whom we now write are the first-fruits of that work; but to spread widely abroad among their race the Christian civilization which has been to them individually as the breath of life, raising them up to stand before the world as fellow-men, and vindicate their claim to the equal possession with others of every land and hue of those mental endowments which divide, as by a line of eternal fire, man from the brute—to spread widely abroad this Christian civilization among their fellow Africans, is the task manifestly allotted to Africans. It is on this ground, among others, that we advocated and enforced in our last the assuming by the community of Sierra Leone of the expense of that educational work among them hitherto at the charge of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, that the funds now thus appropriated by those societies may be set free for commencing similar work in other West African districts. And it is on this ground also that we are so anxiously endeavouring to stimulate them to the production and demand among the natives of new articles for commerce. All civilization must have material resources upon which it may feed, by which it may be supported and strengthened. Christian civilization, and bodily filth and misery as the characteristics of the whole mass of the people, cannot co-exist. As the former progresses, the arts of civilization and the ameliorations of civilized existence must go with it; and these cannot go with it unless the earth is made to ""yield her increase"" by the application to it of a certain organized industry, which it will never receive except under the impulse of a trading demand. The natural riches of Western Africa are enormous, and are such as will sooner or later support a commerce to which that at present existing on the Coast is merely fractional; but for this the means must be employed by those whom God is manifestly raising up for the work. And lastly, it is on this ground that we call upon all the European employés of the British Crown in Africa to use the means and power of their position for helping on the educated Africans in that propaganda of civilization of which we have been treating. The Parliamentary Committee of 1865 has declared in favour of the preparation of Africans for self-government; and whatever may have been the opinions previously entertained by governors and others in authority on the Coast, from that moment it has become additionally their duty to bring the educated Africans into consultation and into participation in power, as regards the revenues to be raised among them, and the mode in which and the objects for which those revenues shall be spent.

Why are we urging this upon the Government—upon governors, and upon subjects? Because with an increase of the useful power of civilised government in the interior, those roads will also act as a curb to the aggressive instincts of Ashantee—as stimulants to increased production, because affording facilities for increased commerce—as placing the engines of civilization in immediate contact with the hitherto unmitigated barbarous superstitions of Ashantee; and rendering it possible for the missionary society labouring in the protectorate to advance and maintain its outposts, in an efficient state at a considerable distance from the Coast without a ruinous expense, and without that dangerous and weakening isolation which has hitherto almost neutralised the zeal and devotion of its indefatigable agents.\n\nIn such a country as Africa, and among such people as the Africans, the power of Christian civilization must be exhibited wherever there are efforts for inculcating Christianity, if these latter are to have any corresponding success. The creation and maintenance of good roads, where such facilities for intercommunication have hitherto been unknown, would be a great and useful exhibition of the power of Christian civilization. They could not fail surely and more or less rapidly to ameliorate the social condition of a people which, amid tropical luxuriance, suffers most frightful privations. And every stage of that amelioration would be a material argument that all could appreciate in favour of that Christianity which the missionary would be engaged in teaching. Such palpable evidences that Christianity has the ""promise of the life that now is"" will dispose them the more readily to believe that it has also indeed and in truth ""the promise of that which is to come."" And in our humble opinion it is as much the duty of a Christian people to exhibit such material evidences to the heathen, as adjuncts to missionary teaching, as it is their duty to send the latter. The material blessings which God has bestowed upon the world through Christianity ought to be pressed into his service as allies of Gospel truth. These can exercise an influence upon the yet unconverted heathen, and predispose him to listen to those who may be striving for his eternal welfare, although of themselves they are, of course, without any regenerating power; and may even, when unaccompanied by Christianity, only add new vices to the old degradation.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Every month's experience justifies more and more the views of the African-Aid Society upon this question—views which they have only not carried into practical operation because, hitherto, there have been no funds for the work. To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth.

To this our energies are, now, as they have been for years past, devoted. To those who have not considered the matter as we have, the idea of any rapid advancement in the solution might well seem to be Utopian. We have to deal with countries in which the dense ignorance of superstitious barbarism universally prevails—with countries in which the British people do not settle as colonists, where European mercantile houses trade, but do not leave in them any of the profits, if such there be, of their commerce, and where consequently there is little or no increase of capital that may be devoted to works of improvement. We have to deal with countries in which the action of the British Government has been hitherto simply protective, and not in any degree whatever initiative; ameliorating the condition of the people only in so far as the amelioration is necessary to give protection to trade and commerce at the stations which it occupies, and in the dependent territories, by prohibiting at and within them the outrages to humanity in which the most blood-thirsty superstition known in the world formerly indulged—in abolishing that fruitful source of evil and degradation, domestic slavery, and thus leaving the field open for the civilizing agency of commercial intercourse, the unselfish efforts of philanthropy, and of those religious societies which devote themselves to the promulgation of the glad tidings of salvation among the heathen, diffusing among them the great blessing of education, and enabling them to read those Scriptures of truth on the observance of the sacred precepts contained in which the true happiness of the human race so entirely depends. Great indeed have been and are the advantages thus bestowed upon a portion of the people of West Africa. History necessarily affords no parallel. Ere yet the efforts of the British Government to put an end to the odious foreign slave-trade had been crowned with full success, the application of steam in navigation brought those countries into easy communication with the Christian civilization of Great Britain, which may be said to have swooped down upon them, embracing many of them, educated by the religious societies, in its folds. The easy access to England thus afforded by steam has been largely, and is increasingly, availed of by those who had been thus educated, and who, by trade and commerce introduced among them, have obtained the necessary pecuniary means. Not a few of the children of these have also been sent to Great Britain for education. The civilization of Europe has thus become familiar to many, while still the great masses of the people in and beyond the narrow limits of a few Coast towns remain in the dense darkness of heathen ignorance, and more or less openly the victims of heathen superstitions, without any incentive to industrial action beyond what is necessary for obtaining the commonest necessaries of life. Now those countries in which the peoples are thus left to the natural inertia of ignorant tropical humanity, must,—that is our problem—must be brought within the area of Christian civilization. We say Christian civilization, because there is a species of Mahometan civilization, as in Persia; and of heathen, as in China; neither of which we desire for Africa. How are they to be so brought? How? They cannot be so brought except by the civilization by which, we desire them to be embraced,—advancing to their help, seeking them, searching them out, holding forth to them the hand of fellowship, showing them the material advantages it enjoys, and of which it desires to make them partakers. Year after year have we brooded over this problem, our only consolation meanwhile being that the number of more or less educated natives in the Coast towns was in constant increase; that the education they were receiving, being under missionary superintendence, included some knowledge of the articles of universal Christian belief, and, at least, a theoretical acquaintance with those blessed precepts, even the very imperfect observance of which by the inhabitants of the Christian world has contributed so largely to human happiness by emancipating mankind from the cruel tyranny of evil and bringing them partially into the delicious freedom of righteousness. Those natives, more or less educated, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, were indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection should be arranged. That they are not themselves sufficiently under the dominion of Christian civilization to lead them to become its apostles among their hitherto less favoured countrymen has been sufficiently proved by the reception accorded by some of them in Abeokuta to the proposal made by us to link that town with Lagos by means of a railway. They would none of it. They strove to set the heathen mind against it. They would rather things should remain as they are. The education they have received has only served to develop selfishness in them, by showing them the advantages they possess through it over the heathen among whom they dwell—advantages which they do not wish to see reduced by the introduction of others into that portico of the temple of knowledge in which they have themselves secured a footing. But though their help will be unwillingly given, they will and must nevertheless become an important, as they do also constitute a necessary, element in that onward march of civilization which we have projected. The more and more we have studied the problem, the more and more convinced we become, and are, that the onward march must be by means of railways between British sea-coast possessions and the interior. No half measures will suffice. As a first step toward the working out of our problem, we put forward, some twelve months and more ago, our proposals to construct four light railways: three within the Gold Coast territories proper, and one within native territory, with a British Gold Coast Colony possession as a base. We felt that the publication of these proposals would enable us to test the degree in which the educated African element might be made co-operative in the elucidation. We soon discovered that, with two or three individual exceptions, that element was nowhere sufficiently enlightened to be co-operative in any other way than by its paid employment, whenever we should be ready with the pounds, shillings, and pence with which to make the work a personal benefit to each and all of them. Our proposals did not provoke or awake or create the smallest scintilla of interest or enthusiasm. They fell flat upon the understandings, and did not quicken the pulsations of any heart. Almost every individual fraction of this element seemed to fancy that in some way or other a railway, if introduced, would interfere with or prejudice the little trading or other game in which he was engaged; and, as we have before said, with one or two exceptions, the great broad view of human misery to be relieved, of human happiness to be increased, of human emancipation from the fetters of degrading and debasing evil to be achieved, of human benefits to be bestowed, and of the spread of the knowledge of the great and precious gift of eternal life obtainable through faith in Christ Jesus, never presented itself to mind, or heart, or soul,—engrossed only by its own little personal dust-heap, in which it might be grubbing for its own little personal enjoyments, and the gratification of its own little personal vanities and desires.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

That the Mohammedan negro has reached a more real civilization, a higher stage of education, and a richer mean of material prosperity than his Christian brother is certain. One of the most obvious explanations of this, of course, is that while Arab missionaries have been at work in Africa for many centuries, the effort to Christianize its peoples is of very recent origin. Moreover, the negro Mohammedan has access to an ancient and poetic literature, and he has availed himself of it to a far wider extent than might be supposed. Dr. Blyden thinks that the spread of the English language will have a powerful effect in arresting the progress of Islamism; and he may be right. He is sanguine that Christianity must ultimately be the dominant faith of Africa. That it should be so is apart from purely religious considerations, of vast practical importance, since Christianity alone offers adequate safeguards against the continuance of the slave trade. The particular form of Christianity which will in the end find most favour in Africa matters comparatively little; but Dr. Blyden hints that Roman Catholicism seems to be peculiarly suited to the spiritual needs of his countrymen, who beyond all doubt already owe to it a deep measure of gratitude.\n\nThis book is a valuable contribution to the literature of a fascinating subject, and it is to be hoped that it will receive the attention it deserves.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Among the visible means for the accomplishment of the great work of the Christian civilization of Africa, we have ever pointed to a possible immigration into Africa of considerable numbers of American negroes released from the cruel yoke of slavery.

Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

Finally, investment by foreign nationals and firms in commercial, agricultural and mining enterprises was greater in Liberia than in Ethiopia; and while it aided the processes of modernization, it also led to greater foreign control of the Liberian economy than was the case in Ethiopia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.756, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927.

We hope they will now hasten to get rid of this idea, and send their proper quota (which ought to be a large one) of cotton to England. It is only by the extension of agriculture, and the consequent increase of agricultural wealth, that the Liberian Government can obtain permanent and solid relief from those financial embarrassments which cripple the energies of the practical man now at the head of the State as President. The currency, which is paper, can be bought for specie at twenty-five per cent. discount; while for many goods it is declined altogether.

The estimate of crop which has been sent to us from these plantations seems to be, however, very low; so low, that we think there must be some error, unless a larger portion of the cane than we are aware of is of too recent planting to give good crops this season.

The Need of Endowment. We set on foot an Endowment Fund on the twenty-first anniversary of our existence as a Native Church, in 1883. We have raised £250 towards it. One of our Native Church members has given £1,000. Our object in raising an endowment is to set us free to appropriate all we can possibly raise annually to educational and missionary effort. At present our daily supply barely meets our daily need. The sooner our Church members and friends can endow the Pastorate the sooner shall we really be aggressive. It is a vast undertaking to raise enough money to ensure to some fifteen pastors £100 a year, but it must be done. We wish our delegates to press this matter on the minds of those who wish to see us a truly aggressive Church, and we beg our friends to understand that a very false impression exists as to native wealth in West Africa. There are a few wealthy men, comparatively speaking, but they are scattered amongst the many Christian bodies.\n\n(b.) We are resolved to improve the quality of our education, and our delegates will plead for money to enable the Native Church to set on foot a good system of training of schoolmasters. If we are to be a Missionary Church and a light to the darkness around, the training of our children must be taken up in real earnest. At present many grow up untaught, many more with but a surface knowledge, and thus with this most dangerous smattering, go off from us along the coast, miserable and unfair representatives of Sierra Leone Christianity.

They are both Protestant Churches; both hold and teach the essential truths of the Gospel, and love to see the Bible in the hands of every member of their communion, and, indeed, of every human being, as containing all that is necessary to human salvation without dependence on priesthood or human inventions. The work of evangelisation has been carried on by both of them in the colony with equal zeal and success, and both ought to receive aid from the revenues of the colony, if that aid can be given in a form which does not create dependence. And we are sure that it may and ought to be thus given. The civil authorities have done next to nothing as regards the education of the people, which has hitherto been the work of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies and the Native Pastorate. Let this work continue in their hands. If education and religion be dissociate in Sierra Leone, a people will be raised up whose excesses would be ruinous. The education given to the rising generation must be combined with religious teaching; and we cannot conceive any way in which the sum of, say, one or two thousand pounds a year could be applied with so great present and future advantage, as in distributing it, whether in the form of capitation grant or in some other equal and impartial way, among the Church and Wesleyan schools. The time has come when the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies ought to be relieved from some part of the burden they have hitherto cheerfully borne in the hope of raising up a people in Sierra Leone to love and serve God.

Patients were received at first in a small room in an adjoining house. The foundation of the present building was laid on April 11, 1859, and it was finished in April, 1862. With the exception of a grant from the Liberian Legislature of 300 dols. a-year, it has been built, and is still supported, by voluntary contributions. It has been erected at the cost of about 6,000 dols. This sum has been contributed by friends in England, in Liberia, and by seamen visiting the port. We have never been in debt, but have always been able to pay all demands against us. Since the commencement of our hospital we have had 45 patients; of these 26 have been colonists, 10 natives, 9 seamen; 30 were men, 10 women, and 5 children; 16 have died, 25 have been dismissed, relieved, or cured, and 4 are now occupying the building. Though the number of patients has not been large, yet it is increasing, as the institution becomes known; and through God\'s help we have accomplished that which we proposed seven years ago—namely, the erection of a house for the sick and suffering, where they may receive help and comfort, both for body and soul. We have a kind Christian lady as the matron, and the colonial physician is the surgeon and physician of the institution. Of all our patients the seamen seem most grateful. Far away from home and friends, to meet with care and kindness, and to find the comforts of a home, with Christian sympathy; these things call out those warm and generous feelings for which seamen are proverbial. We make no extravagant outlay, but we simply desire the means to sustain this Christian home for the sick, on this unhealthy coast. There is a special work for which we now need help. We are erecting a back-building for kitchen, &c. An outlay of 600 or 700 dols. is required.

The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running. We are convinced that there is a more excellent way, and we regret it has not more generally approved itself to those who have done such good work in other respects in this part of Africa.

But he goes on to illustrate from the physical condition of Sierra Leone; from the manners, customs, and ideas of the Negroes, both lay and clerical; from the suspicion with which the independent States surrounding the Colony regard the morals of its population, the difficulties which face one with such heavy responsibilities as are his.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-07-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1894#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is quite impossible for us to dismiss the very important subject of a deficiency of public revenue at Sierra Leone with the brief notice taken of it in our last. The interesting communications that we have lately inserted, made by persons but too deeply concerned in the Educational department of the colony, on which, with that of religious teaching—the Native Pastorate—the earliest discomforts of the position seem to have fallen, in strict accordance with the old official principles of government in the colony, appeal too strongly to our well-known sympathies and convictions to allow of our doing so. We have received so many letters during the last few months, in which the writers give most saddening pictures of the moral state and condition of the colony, which our personal experience of a too prevalent dishonesty only too fully confirms, that we look upon the curtailment of education and of public religious teaching with the most serious alarm for the future of the colony and for the reputation of Sierra Leoneans everywhere down the Coast. We are quite aware that the old enemies of the African people will point to those conditions of individual mind and practice which our correspondents stigmatize, and of which we complain, and say, ""Education and religious teaching, forsooth! behold the fruits of them; we have had too much of them already. Some of the greatest cheats are men who have more than any other a redundancy of Scripture phrases at the tip of their tongue."" But they are grossly mistaken. Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people. But that retrenchment, on which we feel thus bound to insist, ought never to have touched the School Department or the Native Pastorate. This is indeed beginning at the wrong end.

Mr. Booth has three native catechists, of whom one is conversant with Arabic. Educational work in the District is progressing. Quarterly meetings have been formed, and Circuit stewards this year for the first time took part in the business of the District Meeting. In the Gambia section earnest efforts are being put forth in order to use more effectually the waterway of the Gambia river, and thus really to take hold of the population in the interior. The people themselves have a mind both to give and to work, and so to carry the Gospel inland, to meet the power of Mohammedanism which is advancing from the interior.\n\n""For the Gold Coast District with its several sections, this is the year of Jubilee. Just fifty years ago the Rev. Joseph R. Dunwell began the Methodist Mission at Cape Coast. There are now in West Africa nearly 14,000 members, whilst thousands more have safely found their rest. The Jubilee is to be celebrated by special gatherings, and also by special gifts for the consolidation of existing missions and for extension in the regions beyond. A series of most enthusiastic meetings have already been held in the Cape Coast section of the District, and a sum of £10,000 has been promised to the Jubilee Fund. This result has filled us with wonder and gladness; and, best of all, in connexion with the same meetings, scores of the heathen have renounced their heathenism and turned from dumb idols to serve the living and true God.\n\n""The mission to Ashanti has entered upon a new era.

There was a settlement there before the British Government commenced its crusade against the traffic in human beings, but the population was very small, and the colony had a precarious existence until it was placed under the control of the African Institution, an organization established for the improvement of the western part of Africa. This body, which had the support of all the great men engaged in the anti-slavery movement in England, directed its efforts to the amelioration of the condition of the freed slaves, and did in its time an immense amount of good. Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, was made the head-quarters of the association on the coast, and the captured slaves were landed and settled there. An idea of the extent to which this kind of colonization was carried may be gathered from the fact that the total number of slaves emancipated at Sierra Leone between June, 1819, and January, 1833, was 27,697. The exertions of the association were not merely directed to the settlement of the slaves. A system of education was inaugurated, and the settlers were trained in useful arts. The funds of the association were not always well employed, but the general result of their operations is highly satisfactory, and such as to reflect high honour upon the benevolence of the English people. Sierra Leone is now a flourishing colony, and its inhabitants are further advanced on the paths of civilization than, perhaps, any other body of Africans. Education is widely diffused amongst the community, and many of the higher classes have obtained academic distinction in England, and risen to positions of eminence in their own country. In every walk of life, descendants of emancipated slaves are distinguishing themselves, and justifying the confidence of those who believe in the possibility of the civilization of the negro race.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE MISSIONARY WORK OF THE BAPTIST MISSIONARY SOCIETY IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our missions in Africa date farther back than is commonly supposed. We find a minute of the proceedings of the Society, dated April 7, 1795, to the following effect: ""Inquiries having been made whether there be any farther openings in the heathen world encouraging to attempt the spreading of the kingdom of Christ in it, it appears to us from the Sierra Leone reports, lately published, that such favourable appearances do exist in Africa as deserve our immediate attention."" A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools. The difficulties to be overcome in this mission have been very great; not the least being the necessity of providing the people with written languages. Mr. Saker has translated the Word of God in the Dualla, and has compiled a dictionary and hymn-book.

Why so? Because ministerial discord and dissension are at the bottom of it. One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With these accounts of the rapid spread of Islam we may compare statements as to the comparative failure of Christianity, which, unlike Mohammedanism, is propagated and supported by vast subsidies from England and America.

Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary.""

When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them.""

The push into the hinterland was made possible by the geographical explorations which greatly increased European knowledge of the interior of Africa. Besides, great inspiration was derived by many missionaries from the exploration and ideas of David Livingstone, who made the results of his expeditions known through his prolific writings. His view that missionaries should establish centres of Christianity and civilization which would not only promote religion but also commerce and agriculture, came to be widely shared by many enthusiastic missionaries who penetrated far into the interior of Africa, following the old trade routes.

In 1856 he completed his second journey across Central Africa from Angola to the Zambezi delta. Prior to this period, the Church Missionary Society had sent three German missionaries to start work in East Africa. Johann Krapf arrived in Mombasa in 1844 and was followed by J. Rebmann in 1846 and by J.J. Erhardt in 1849. Their mission station was established at Rabai near Mombasa. By 1856 Rebmann had crossed the Nyika plain to Kilimanjaro to become the first European to see the mountain, and Krapf had gone farther south to visit the Shambaa kingdom of Kimweri and then north› wards to the Kamba country where he was the first European to be shown Mount Kenya. Erhardt and Krapf also travelled farther south to the mouth of the Ruvuma and later, after spending some time in Tanga, Erhardt was able to publish a map of East Africa containing a mass of information he had gathered on the coast about the interior, including the Great Lakes, which he represented as an inland sea. Erhardt's 'map was to be the main inspiration of Burton and Speke in their expedition of 1858'. 51 This first group of missionaries acted as pioneers; they gathered con› siderable information that was extremely valuable to those who followed them. Yet their information hardly came to the attention of the general public and it was only when Livingstone began his attacks on the Arab slave trade in speeches and writings that the popular imagination was caught. In the spirit of the capitalist free-trade conviction of his time, Livingstone was emphasizing the power of commerce, which, he believed, would integrate the vast interior with Christian Europe, thus relieving Africans of the poverty and humiliation caused by the slave trade. He therefore concentrated on travelling in search of navigable rivers, or what he called the 'open path for commerce and Christianity'.$^{52}$ The publication of his Missionary Travels$^{53}$ in 1857, together with his personal appeals, inspired the formation of the Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) by a group of English High Churchmen.

Meanwhile, Stanley, an Anglo-American journalist, adventurer and explorer, who had previously been commissioned to look for Living› stone, had completed a second journey to explore the region further. In 1875 his letter about the possibilities for missionary work in Buganda appeared in the Daily Telegraph. This stimulated a number of British churchmen to offer funds for missionary work. As a result, the CMS expanded from Freretown in Rabai near Mombasa and established a station at Mpwapwa in the middle of Tanzania in 1876 from where missionaries were able to reach Mutesa's capital the following year. Livingstone's own home society, the London Missionary Society, soon decided to follow his steps and, stimulated by a specific offer of funds, decided to go to Lake Tanganyika, the region where Livingstone spent his last years. From 1877 onwards the London Missionary Society established a number of stations near Lake Tanganyika; Ujiji, Urambo, Kavala Island and Mtowa.

The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies.

Even where there existed commercial activities, they were offshoots of missionary work. Two such examples existed. The first was the Livingstonia Central African Trading Company, which was associated with Scottish missionary activities in the Lake Nyasa region. Its aim was said to be that of supplying the mission station at Blantyre with necessities through running steamships in the waterways of the region and also that of bringing ivory for commerce at a price that would undercut the Arab merchants using slave labour for porterage.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': ""Various attempts to imitate the British success in Freetown ranged from the American settlement in Liberia, the French settlement of Libreville in what is now Gabon, and the other British settlement, Freretown, in East Africa.

It needs to be emphasized, however, that the Euro/American presence was waterborne and coast-centred. It made no appreciable penetration into the interior of the continent before 1850, whereas the major events in Africa in the early nineteenth century - the Ethiopian revival, the Mfecane, the West African djihads - were initiated from the interior of the continent, although Muhammad 'Alfs reforms in Egypt were a notable exception.\nThe missionary factor made a substantial contribution to the spectacular British success in Freetown. Responding to the challenge of the new opportunities, German missionaries, mostly from the Basel Mission but with a few from the Bremen Mission, overcame their pietist hesitation and became involved in the politics of development in a British colony. They and their British colleagues found more opportunities as farm managers, linguists, teachers, builders, and promoters of commercial enterprises than as preachers. A number of mission stations were established, and leading individual missionaries became deeply involved in local political and racial conflicts; nevertheless, nothing like the Freetown success was achieved. Elsewhere, missionary organizations were being founded, and a few pioneer mission stations established in which preliminary educational efforts and linguistic studies were being undertaken that would yield fruit later.

Similarly, in British Central Africa, and West Africa, African students were encouraged and often subsidized by American black churches. The latter student sojourns set the stage for a major new phase in African and Afro-American interaction in the colonial period, one which had great consequences for subsequent African nationalist movements in the mid-twentieth century.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 425, 'article_title': 'EASTERN AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'EASTERN AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-11', 'issue_date': '23_08_1864', 'content': 'The breaking up of the Zambezi Mission, and the return of Dr. Livingston to England, are events of so decided a nature as regards the progress of material development and civilization in Eastern Africa, that they cannot be allowed to pass without remark. It is but too common, under analogous circumstances, to declare hastily that all the valuable life sacrificed and the money expended have been sacrificed and expended in vain. Because some immediate advance toward the desired end is not seen as a result of the labour and expenditure, the world gives its verdict of entire failure. Nothing can be more erroneous. Setting aside the fact that there is an issue of some sort or other from every even the most insignificant of human actions, it is incontrovertible that every Christian effort made toward the regeneration of a country long condemned to barbarism, superstition, and unproductiveness, must and does bear fruit. The travels of Dr. Livingston—the efforts made by him against the slave-trade—the labours and sacrifices of the Zambezi Mission—have their permanent place, and were, no doubt, indispensable in the great chain of events connected with the future civilized life of Eastern Africa. As believers in the eventual reclamation of the whole world from the exclusive dominion of evil, which for a time prevents portions of it from fulfilling the Divine mandate and intentions we cannot hold or propagate any other belief. We may, and do deplore, that the results desired when the Zambezi Mission first went out from among us, have not followed immediately from the effort. But, we cannot and we think that no one ought to deplore that the efforts were made. And it is only when a false estimate is taken of them that such feelings can obtain. Regarded as isolated facts, the promptitude with which the Oxford and Cambridge Mission was organised, and the pecuniary support that flooded in, had in them something of grandiose. But to have occupied a permanent place among the Christian and civilizing agencies of the Christian world, that zeal and that liberality should only have been looked upon as the small introductory portions of a vastly larger consecutive movement. The Livingston labours and Zambezi Mission ought to be viewed not alone, but in comparison with the end toward which they were directed. What are two or three thousand a-year from a Government aiding the energy of one ardent man, and 20,000l. with a handful of zealous missionaries, when compared with the deliverance of a quarter of a continent from the cruel tyranny of that evil dominion under which it lies prostrate, bleeding, groaning, shrieking in moral and material agony? What are they? Why, infinitesimal. But, alas! and we write it with the sickness of sorrow and shame, every little effort made for Africa is so magnified in importance in the eyes or mind of the maker or the public, that a most unfair estimate is formed of it, and most unjustifiable expectations are attached to it. With regard to many other portions of the world that have not more than half the claim upon us that may be urged on behalf of Africa, men do give in faith and trust. ""Cast thy bread upon the waters and it shall be found after many days,"" seems at least to be believed in. But when they are solicited to turn their hearts towards Africa, a spasmodic contraction of unchristian selfishness seizes them.

How far he has solved the geographical problems which motived his late persistent efforts, we, as yet, know not; but whether he has solved them or not, we cannot refrain from expressing our sorrow that the accomplished or attempted solution should have cost so valuable a life. For our own part, we had rather those problems should have remained unsolved for another century or two, than that he, who had already done so much for East Africa, should have thus miserably perished there, and been robbed by death of those honours and distinctions and that public esteem which would have surrounded the residue of his life with an aureole of glory. Livingstone, alas! is dead; but the great work that he inaugurated—war to the death against the atrocious East African foreign slave trade—will not perish. All that has of late been done by the British Government for its total suppression, owes its origin to the good Doctor's fearless and untiring exposure of the enormous sin and crime being daily perpetrated in those countries. If the heart of the British people has been at all stirred within them against the monster iniquity perpetrated by Arabs and Portuguese in those vast regions which they were depopulating by its practice, it was the voice and pen of Livingstone that stirred it. The influence he thus wielded for good will not have died with him. The emancipation of Eastern Africa, and its debased people, from the horrors that have held sway over and among them for many long centuries, will, sooner or later, be fully accomplished by the development of those agencies now at work with that object, and other agencies that will necessarily follow them; and when Eastern Africa attains to civilization and Christianity, one of the most honoured names—the central name on its monuments to those who have inaugurated and aided in the mighty work, will be—Livingstone.""}, {'id': 2989, 'article_title': 'Memorial Tablet to Dr. Livingstone', 'full_section_title': 'Memorial Tablet to Dr. Livingstone', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-18', 'issue_date': '01_11_1875', 'content': 'A memorial tablet, on which is the following inscription, now marks the spot in Westminster Abbey where the remains of Dr. Livingstone are deposited: ""Brought by faithful hands over land and sea, here rests David Livingstone, Missionary, Traveller, Philanthropist; born March 19, 1813; died May 1, 1873, at Chitambo\'s Village, Ulala.

But there are other advantages to be thus obtained beyond the mere profitable exchange of commodities and the employment of capital. If we can, through opening such a route to Timbuctoo from such a base of operations, put an end to the caravan trade from Morocco and Tripoli, we put an end at the same time to that horrible Central African slave-trade, the enormities of which have been too often described to need repetition here. The influence of such a change on the productive energies of Central Africa must be incalculable. How to put an end to that slave-trade has long occupied the attention of British philanthropists and statesmen. The importation of slaves from the Soudan *via* Tripoli, and their introduction thence to the slave markets of Egypt and Turkey, have been but too notorious. How to put an end to this was the difficulty—a difficulty that never yet found solution. It may be that Mr. Mackenzie has found what was thus sought for. We pray God it may prove to be so. The social habits and institutions of Morocco, Tripoli, Egypt, Turkey, and Persia are such that nothing but an absolute cutting off of the supply of African flesh and blood can prevent them from being eager purchasers of negro slaves. We turn with ardent hope, in our great trouble on this head, to Mr. Mackenzie, his expedition, and his proposed settlement and subsequent operations. A Mr. Saunders, who, with a Mr. Rochausen, made a most unexpected and violent opposition to Mr. Mackenzie’s plan at the Society of Arts meeting, seemed to consider that the accursed Morocco and Tripoli caravan trade is perfection. How could commerce, he asked, be carried on more cheaply? The camels cost but little, their food a mere nothing, and the food of the caravan men very little more. Mr. Saunders spoke as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, and of the African Section of the Society of Arts, and in this capacity gave his most strenuous opposition to Mr. Mackenzie’s happily-conceived project. He must have known of the diabolical slave-trade carried on by these caravans, but this did not seem to be worthy his notice. We are glad indeed to say that the sense of the meeting was dead against him. The Chairman, the Hon. Evelyn Ashley, M.P., one of the best chairmen we ever saw at a public meeting, gave Mr. Saunders and his friend full licence, until it became necessary to interfere for preventing what seemed to be offensive personal remarks to Sir Arthur Cotton, who is enthusiastic for Mr. Mackenzie’s Expedition. “Give us,” said Sir Arthur, “young men like Mr. Mackenzie, who do not know the words difficulty and impossibility.” The Expedition is to consist of some twenty members, all gentlemen we believe; and if it leave England, as we hope it will do, during the present month, or at any other time, we wish it the fullest success. Whether Mr. Mackenzie’s anticipations will be realized, we cannot pretend to say; but good must come of such an expedition, even if not the precise good that may have been contemplated. Our allusion to the interruption that the proceedings at the meeting sustained by the inroad of so vehement an opponent as Mr. Saunders, turned us aside from the further statement of advantages that Central Africa would derive from such settlement and such a trading route as Mr. Mackenzie proposes to establish and open. Owing to the nature of the climate within the tropical regions of the West Coast, there are no British communities to exercise the influence of European civilization directly upon native communities; and not the least of the advantages for Central Africa will, we think, be found in the immediate and direct intercourse between the people of such a settlement and the natives of the Soudan. We cannot imagine anything so likely to lead to a rapid progress of civilization and Christianity throughout those districts, which the slave-trade, with its attendant abominations and consequences direct and indirect, has so mightily aided to debase and to degrade. We are glad to find that Her Majesty’s Government are well disposed towards Mr. Mackenzie’s Expedition. They ought to be so, or they would not be worthy of such a country as Great Britain, which has been raised by the spirit of enterprise in its people, and by noble instincts and aspirations among them, to be the very head and front of the civilizing agencies of the world.'}, {'id': 3103, 'article_title': 'Progress of the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Progress of the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-20', 'issue_date': '01_05_1876', 'content': 'The first idea of a mission was started, in response to an earnest appeal made by Dr. Livingstone, at a meeting at Cambridge, in 1857. It may be regarded as having been formally instituted at a second meeting at Cambridge, on the 1st of November, 1859. The first head of the Mission was Bishop Mackenzie, who established a station at Magomero, on the River Shiri, where a large settlement of slaves, liberated by the Mission party, was formed under the guidance of Dr. Livingstone. The appeal proceeds with a summary of the work that is being done by the Mission at the present time. 1. On the site of the old slave market at Zanzibar, purchased by the liberality of the Rev. A. N. West, of Pembroke College, who died whilst in sole charge of the Mission, Christmas-day, 1874, a fine church which is far advanced towards completion. Adjoining it the Bishop hopes soon to erect houses for the clergy and mission workers, schools, and a hospital. 2. At Mbweni, four miles from Zanzibar, a settlement of adult liberated slaves has been formed, and attached to this station is a girls’ school. 3. At Kiungani, two miles from Zanzibar, is a large boys’ industrial school, which is partly self-supporting. Much of the carpenter’s and other work for the fabric of the Zanzibar church has been done here. 4. A house in Zanzibar was opened as a hospital on Dec. 12, 1875, upon the arrival of Miss Allen and two nurses. It has already done excellent service. 5. Magila, the Mission station on the mainland, is in charge of the Rev. J. P. Farler and Mr. Moss, and has lately been reinforced by Mr. Clarke; the reports are favourable. Bishop Steere has just returned to Zanzibar after five months’ absence on an expedition to the Nyassa country. The details of this interesting journey, begun from Linoi (a point some distance south of Zanzibar, and the nearest part of the coast to Lake Nyassa), at the end of last October, and completed Jan. 21, 1876, will be found in a pamphlet printed at Zanzibar, and now issued under the title of “A Walk to the Nyassa Country.” This suggests the feasibility of extending the operations of the Mission over 300 miles or upwards on the mainland in the direction of the country first occupied under Bishop Mackenzie towards Lake Nyassa. It also affords convincing evidence of the existence still of the slave-trade in the number of caravans which were met. It reveals likewise, incidentally, the self-devotion and perseverance of the Bishop, who when the European members of his party failed him through ill health, started on the journey with native bearers only. The Bishop estimates that by this means some 10,000 slaves were conveyed to the coast. By God’s providence the journey was, notwithstanding difficulties and privations, accomplished safely. In a letter recently addressed by Bishop Steere to the members of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, he says: “I have just returned from a walk of some 700 miles, through almost unknown country, undertaken in your name and for your honour. I have agreed with the greatest of the native chiefs (Mataka) near the Lake Nyassa for a site and for countenance in our mission. I find that my appeal for personal help is being nobly responded to. We paid during the year 20 outward passages. I hear of four more, perhaps now on their way, and of others pressing to follow them. . . . There remain 14 of us, mostly young students, out of whom I feel no doubt the most efficient missionaries will ultimately be formed. Not one of my helpers is desiring money profit from his work. So, then, I feel sure that, if not the Universities, the English Church will find us the men and women we need.'}, {'id': 3315, 'article_title': 'THE CIVILIZATION OF EAST AND EAST CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'THE CIVILIZATION OF EAST AND EAST CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1877#article-17', 'issue_date': '01_03_1877', 'content': 'Our work for West Africa has so engrossed our time and space that, beyond an occasional record of passing events, we have not been able to give to the affairs of East and East Central Africa the attention which their vast importance demands, and which we have been only too desirous to bestow. But the time has now come when they force themselves irresistibly upon us. The blood of martyrs was the seed of the Church. In like manner has the death of the devoted Dr. Livingstone in the swampy morasses of East Africa, been fruitful in results. From the period when the mortal remains of that indefatigable pioneer of Christian civilization, transported with so much faithful care, arrived in these lands from which he had gone forth on his heavenly mission, there has been no pause in the blessed work that he originated. A like spirit with that which animated and supported him was infused into Dr. Stewart, Lieutenant Young, and others; and while the efforts of the Church Missionary Society became redoubled, the Livingstonia Mission to Lake Nyassa took the field with a care, energy, and intrepidity characteristic of the people of that portion of Great Britain in which dear Dr. Livingstone had his birth. We were overjoyed when Scotland took up the work which its great departed son had so zealously begun and so unflinchingly pursued; sustained as he was, by those high considerations and elevated desires which can be born only of a living faith in Christ Jesus. Carried on by his countrymen and successors with the same high hopes and aims, and assisted by the practical knowledge which the pioneer had gathered and imparted, we are not surprised that a great success has so far attended the work of the Livingstonia Industrial Mission. The town of Livingstonia has been founded on the shores of Nyassa; and a vessel propelled by steam—that mighty agent of modern civilization—is navigating the sealike waters of that extensive and elevated lake, the surface of which is nearly 2,000 feet above the level of the ocean. The report which we now publish, copied from the Standard and Mail of the Cape of Good Hope, sounds in our heart like the mighty outburst of heavenly music, ushering a new world into existence. The spreading of Christian civilization and industry throughout East Central Africa will be, indeed, to create a new moral world, in the place of that debased and degraded one which the darkest ignorance, the most cruel superstitions, and a foreign slave-trade of unsurpassed atrocity carried on by ruthless Arabs, have overspread with every imaginable abomination. The light is indeed appearing with glorious rays of promise on the hitherto dark horizon of East Central Africa. Missionary societies, devoted individual effort, Her Majesty\'s Government, and, from the period of his return from his happy visit to this country, the Sultan of Zanzibar, are all cooperating earnestly. The seed sown by Livingstone is germinating on every side, and, by God\'s blessing, there will be a rich and abundant harvest. The wretched foreign slave-trade is already crippled, and cannot, we hope, be much longer carried on, in defiance of the now-opposing Sultan of Zanzibar and of the increased vigilance of Her Majesty\'s ships of war. The chief opposing obstacle is to be found in the authorities of the Egyptian and Portuguese settlements. In the account we now publish of Lieutenant Young\'s Expedition, it will be observed that the authorities at Quillimaine gave ample evidence of the deep hostility with which they regarded the British efforts for the annihilation of what has been to them the profitable slave-trade, and for the spread of Christian civilization in the interior countries. But the end in view is too sacred, too important in every way, for the continuance of that hostility to be permitted. We cannot believe that the Portuguese Government has even the smallest shade of desire that the evils which have prevailed in Eastern Africa shall be perpetuated. We look to them for a more enlightened policy. If the work now so happily begun at Lake Nyassa is to be vigorously carried on—of which we do not entertain any doubt—and if the best seaport for the Nyassa Settlement is Quillimaine, the Portuguese Government will surely be made to perceive that by a moderate customs tariff, and by affording every possible facility to the members of the Livingstonia Mission, they will be laying the foundation of a prosperity at Quillimaine such as it never yet has attained, or ever could attain to by its affording protection and aid to those vilest of all human beings who would perpetuate the slave-trade, with its indescribable horrors. We are glad to see that the reports by Lieutenant Young and Commander Cameron have made some stir in legislative and governmental circles at Lisbon. There was a preliminary notice in the Chambers, and a subsequent discussion. We are not surprised that the prevailing feeling then evinced was that of stigmatizing the ""Young"" and ""Cameron"" reports as false and calumnious. This has ever been the feeling shown under similar circumstances at Lisbon—a feeling which has encouraged the officials in Africa to persevere in the evil courses which produce for them pecuniary benefits, and has often given us so much reason to doubt the sincerity of the Portuguese Government itself as regards any expressed desire on its part to co-operate for the extinction of the slave-trade, and the suppression of all slave-trade practices within the range of its jurisdiction or influence. We believe every word of Lieutenant Young and Commander Cameron\'s reports to be true; and so do the legislators and officials in Lisbon, whatever they may say to the contrary. There have been confirmatory reports from Portuguese subjects, who considered that the country was disgraced by such proceedings. The result of this troubling of the waters of Portuguese African lethargy or corruption will, we venture to hope, be a healing one. With reference to Lieutenant Young\'s complaints, we are glad to find that Her Majesty\'s Government have appointed a Vice-Consul at Quillimaine. Then with regard to the foreign slave-trade carried on from Egyptian Red Sea ports, there can be no doubt it has been an extensive one. Undeniable proof of this was placed before the Khedive, as well as of an increasingly active slave-trade in the Soudan; and this has led, in consequence of urgent remonstrances on the part of Her Majesty\'s Government, to the dispatch of an Egyptian squadron under Admiral M\'Killop to visit, inspect, and watch.'}, {'id': 3322, 'article_title': 'THE LIVINGSTONIA MISSION TO LAKE NYASSA.', 'full_section_title': 'THE LIVINGSTONIA MISSION TO LAKE NYASSA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1877#article-24', 'issue_date': '01_03_1877', 'content': ""Before the arrival of the second party, headed by the Rev.

Houses, workshops, &c., had been constructed. Lieutenant Young and his party, it may be well understood, were not idle. When this second party arrived they were cheered to find that the noble undertaking was well begun. It certainly is not to the credit of the Portuguese authorities at Quillimane that they should have thrown obstacles in the way of Dr. Stewart's party, which was detained there for 14 days. We are aware of the fact that Sir Henry Barkly gave special letters of commendation to the Portuguese Governor. If ever an expedition was to be commended as in the cause of civilization and progress, the Livingstonia one was. They were charged 26 per cent custom dues—an undoubtedly exorbitant tariff—and obstacles thrown in their way besides. It was the idea of the Rev. Dr. Black that a postal route might be opened up at once between the lake and Nyassa, but as far as we can understand from what Lieutenant Young tells us, the Portuguese at Quillimane have their interests otherwise than with progress and the spread of civilization in Africa. How easily such a postal route could be organized is apparent when we state that Lieutenant Young has succeeded in making a treaty with two of the most important tribes in the route *via* Quillimane, the Cataracts of the Shira, and Nyassa. These tribes are the Maviti, near the lake, and the Makololo, 150 miles off, at the Cataracts. They know the name of England, and trust it. As Lieutenant Young says, now an Englishman may go through the whole country with a walking-stick; but a Portuguese requires armed force. It is to be hoped that something will be done by the English authorities which will compel the Portuguese to give way to the progress of events in that part of the continent of Africa. No doubt Lieutenant Young will have something to say to Sir Bartle Frere on this subject, and possibly to the King of the Belgians, as well as to his own Government.""}, {'id': 3940, 'article_title': 'MR.

Why then, it may be asked, transfer it to other hands? Briefly stated, the explanation is that the Mission has so grown and developed that the East London Institute can no longer do justice to it. The original and main object of the Institute is the discovery of suitable volunteers for the mission-field, the training of such when discovered, and the assisting them to get to work in the great world field; and the Livingstone Inland Mission is fast outgrowing its parental institution, and becoming the larger enterprise of the two. Indeed, it has become important enough to rank as one of the principal enterprises of a great Missionary Society. Fully assured that some change was desirable in the interests of the Mission, the Institute gladly welcomed the intimation made known to them about a year ago that the American Baptist Missionary Union was looking for a good opening into Central Africa. Negotiations, subsequently carried on, have resulted in the Mission being taken over by this society. In offering this noble-hearted enterprise our best wishes for its success under its new management, we feel constrained to allow that there is something appropriate in an arrangement which places in American hands the first Mission established on the great river opened up to the world by American capital and enterprise. But for the enterprise of the New York Herald, and the indomitable courage and endurance of the great explorer, Stanley, the Congo River would probably have remained this day as unknown as for ages past.'}, {'id': 5006, 'article_title': 'MR.

A fleet of Arab vessels sails across the Red Sea. An army of stern fanatics debark; they climb the steep passes of Abyssinia, and soon mount the lofty plateau. They are mounted on fleet dromedaries with housings of velvet adorned with gold and silver filigree, on coursers of Yemen and white asses of Arabia. They unfurl their standards, and, with pennons streaming, they advance against paganism with the fierce cry of ""Death to the unbeliever! There is no god but God, and Mahomet is His prophet."" Terror precedes them, death accompanies them, desolation follows them. The apostle of Islam knows no mercy. Ages elapse, and this creed overruns North Africa. From Guardafin to Cape Juba the Crescent is triumphant. The Libyan Desert and the Sahara is traversed, and invincible and dauntless, the proud riders advance towards the Equator, when suddenly the camels are stricken down as by a pestilence; the high-spirited steeds become nerveless and die, and the white asses shrink under the mysterious change of nature. Baffled, they return to resume their conquests over the dry deserts and rocky plateaus of Northern Africa, leaving the southern half of Africa to other influences and to higher natures. That is one picture. The other is of a more modern period. From the Cape of Good Hope advances a Christian missionary, with a meek and humble following of Hottentot servants, a waggon, and a few teams of oxen. He advances northward towards the untravelled wilds of Southern Africa. He seeks the heathen in his home, and hails him as a brother. The accents of love and brotherhood fall on the astonished ears of the dark native. He soothes the benighted man with the vision of a heaven, comforts him with the assurance of a Redeemer, and inspires in him the hope of salvation. And ever as he advances northwards he repeats the song of the angels which they sang above Bethlehem—""Peace on earth and good-will towards men."" This same Christian arrives finally on the banks of the Zambesi; thence directs his path westward to the Atlantic Ocean. Back again whence he came he retraces his wearied steps, and he halts not until he has viewed the waters of the Indian Ocean. And along all that vast mileage he has dropped the sweet words of peace and love, and on whomsoever he gazed with those eyes radiant with loving fellowship he has blessed with the view of a good man made perfect by trial in the wilderness. After a short pause among his own kind he returns to Africa, and for fifteen years more he continues to move among the lost nations, loving and loved, blessing and being blessed, and at last surrenders his life in their midst on the shores of Bangweolo; and as we turn to the map of Africa to regard the traces of his footsteps we behold the outlines of the Cross of the Redeemer drawn by Livingstone during his thirty-two years of travel in the southern half of Africa. There was point and majesty in the proud advance of Mahomet into Abyssinia, but the picture of the loving Christian wandering in those untrodden wilds of South Africa, with charity and good-will for his motto, is almost divine. It is grand to think of the brave, undaunted Arabs, so invincible in war, carrying the Crescent flag from the Red Sea to the Atlantic; but it is still grander to think of the larger conquests achieved by this meek and patient follower of Christ by the simple power of Christian love. Give the due meed to the Arabs for their valour and their matchless courage, with which they carried their faith over many a thousand leagues in Northern Africa; but the undying constancy, the persistent resolution, the patient fortitude of this lone soldier of the Cross during his long and blameless crusade in the strongholds of paganism is sublime. Well, then, since this Christian, with all his unrivalled goodness and piety, has declared that the end of the geographical feat is the beginning of commercial enterprise, do you wonder that I—the last of his race and colour who talked with him—should take up his work with the view of redeeming Africa from its forlornness and squalid poverty, by initiating legitimate commercial enterprise among them?

Sir Henry Rawlinson, in presenting Mr. Comber to the meeting, reminded the Society that some six years ago he had read a very interesting paper describing the northern slopes of the Cameroons Mountains. Mr. Comber, who was a Fellow of the Society, had been for the last eight years in Western Africa. Going to the country as a medical missionary of the Baptist Missionary Society, Mr. Comber had, with some of his brother missionaries, pushed up the river above Stanley Pool about 400 miles, ascending a part of the Congo which had never been navigated before, except by Stanley in his original descent from Nyanngwe. Mr. Comber prefaced his notes of a five weeks\' trip with his colleague, the Rev. George Grenfell, on the Congo by a short account of the steamer Peace, in which the voyage was made. This boat was presented to the Baptist Missionary Society by Mr. Robert Arthington, of Leeds. She was constructed by Messrs. Thornycroft & Co., of Chiswick, and being shipped in plates, was carried in 800 loads overland to Stanley Pool, where she was put together. Proving entirely satisfactory on her trial trip round the Pool, she started up river on July 7 last. Arrived at the first important affluent, the Bochini (Stanley\'s Kwa or Ibari Nkutu), they ascended this river for about 100 miles, carefully hugging the south bank, so as not to miss the Kwango, and finally found themselves at the junction of the two rivers Kwango and Lake Leopold river. Returning to the Congo, they continued their ascent of that river as far as 1 deg. 50 min. N. lat. to the town of Liboko, on the frontier of the Mangala country. Their time having then expired, they were obliged to return to Stanley Pool.'}, {'id': 5094, 'article_title': 'THE UPPER CONGO', 'full_section_title': 'THE UPPER CONGO', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_05_1885', 'content': '\n\nSpeaking of the health of Europeans, Mr. Comber said in the delta, at Banana, Mboma, Mukimvika, and on the coast near the river—Cabinda, Landana, and Loango—there were a large number of Europeans of all nationalities, generally traders, who for the most part appeared to be almost always well, as if they had a charm against the fevers. They stayed out for five or ten years at a stretch, and lived as well as in Europe. Secondly, in the cataract region of the Congo, between Vivi and Stanley Pool, some 200 Europeans had been living during the past six years, of whom a large percentage, perhaps 25 per cent, had died, generally from fever. Thirdly, a number of Europeans, perhaps 30, had been living or travelling on the Upper Congo between Stanley Pool and Stanley Falls. With the exception of one instance, no death had occurred from sickness, and most of these had enjoyed good health. There was little doubt but that the heavy mortality in the second instance had been due in part to the exposure and fatiguing work undergone in travelling, building, &c. This would be very greatly lessened when a railway was constructed, and more skilled labour introduced or developed. At the invitation of the Chairman, General Sir F. Goldsmid, Mr. H. H. Johnston, Mr. Delmar Morgan, and Mr. Guinness (of the Livingstone Inland Mission), made some remarks upon the work which was being accomplished upon the Congo. Sir H. Rawlinson, in tendering the thanks of the Society to Mr. Comber for the interesting and scientifically valuable paper he had read, said what he had told them was the more remarkable when one considered that ten years ago we knew nothing whatever of these regions. Livingstone, though he had seen and described the upper sources of the river, died without knowing that it was the Congo, and in the belief that he had been travelling on the upper waters of the Nile, and it was not until Mr. Stanley went down that we were able to connect these with the Upper Congo. Paying a tribute to the energy, courage, perseverance, and endurance of Mr. Stanley, whom he had hoped to see present, and from whom they still hoped on some future evening soon to have an account of his later geographical observations, Sir Henry Rawlinson concluded by expressing his sense of the great services to civilization rendered by the disinterested labours of the King of the Belgians. By his unremitting care his Majesty had fairly launched the International African Association, and he had achieved a great success, and had, in fact, founded a Free State. Already, as an outcome of this work, two missions like the Baptist Mission and the Livingstone Inland Mission had been established, and these were creating a perfect revolution in the condition of the country. As geographers, as philanthropists, and as Christians, they had hitherto followed the progress of the African Association with the utmost interest, and now that it had emerged from its chief difficulties, they must all congratulate the King of the Belgians on his success. They might also feel an honest pride in the fact that Englishmen had taken such a large share in the enterprise.'}, {'id': 5684, 'article_title': 'Our Interests in Central Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Our Interests in Central Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_04_1888#article-7', 'issue_date': '02_04_1888', 'content': '## OUR INTERESTS IN CENTRAL AFRICA.\n\n**EVENTS** are plainly showing that East Africa was unhappily overlooked in the Berlin Convention.

Delagoa Bay is certainly destined to be an important South African depot for cotton and other articles of British trade. From Mombas it may be hoped that trade communications will be opened not only to the Masai and the great Gallas tribes, but stretching on to Lakes Nyanza and Albert and the Eastern Soudan. The African Lakes Company also provides a waterway of some 1,400 miles, with only some 275 miles of land navigation—all of which is in the control of the Company, stretching on to the north end of Lake Tanganyika, which is less than 300 miles from Lake Albert, with a probably large waterway on the Muta Nzige. Mr. Stanley chose the way of access to Emin Pasha by the Congo. This is certainly favourable to the Congo Company, and opens to France a new access to the Eastern Soudan, but it includes a longer and more difficult land journey. The Livingstone Mission is a Free Church of Scotland Mission, but it receives the cordial support of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Its originators were Scottish merchants, such as Dr. Young, of Kelly, Mr. James Stevenson, Mr. White, of Overton, and others. After initiating the mission, their next effort was to establish the African Lakes Company, partly to supply mission material needs, but mainly to introduce legitimate traffic with the natives. The Company was founded on broad commercial principles, but with the important proviso, thoroughly carried out, of supplying no intoxicants to the natives. The financial basis of the Company remains with the wealthy Glasgow capitalists who rather for philanthropy than gain began the undertaking, and who alone still direct and control it.'}, {'id': 5689, 'article_title': 'The Recent Arab Invasion of the Nyassa Settlements', 'full_section_title': 'The Recent Arab Invasion of the Nyassa Settlements', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_04_1888#article-12', 'issue_date': '02_04_1888', 'content': ""The details of the Arab invasion of the district of Nyassa and the attack made on the station at Karonga, recently published, possess very special interest.

It is not a denominational enterprise. It appeals for support to the friends of Christian missions in Africa, but its chief supporters are Free Churchmen and United Presbyterians. From the first it was intended that the mission should be more than a centre for evangelistic work. The aim of its promoters was to found a Christian industrial settlement, with the conversion of the natives to Christianity as its chief aim, but also seeking the introduction of civilization by the aid of commerce and industrial arts.

HENRY STANLEY, the rescuer of the late lamented Livingstone, and now Exploring Commissioner in Eastern Africa for the proprietors of the London Daily Telegraph and the New York Herald, is already giving evidence that so important a mission could not have been entrusted to one more fit and able than he is, both to explore and describe. The Daily Telegraph of the 24th inst. contained a letter of Mr. Stanley's, occupying eight columns, in which he gives a lively and most interesting account of his ascent of the River Rufiji, which flows through ten mouths into the ocean. Our space is already too much occupied this month to permit our doing justice to this letter, which proves how little we have hitherto known of the navigable waters of Eastern Africa, and of the facilities which water communication with the far interior, offer to a future commerce; in presence of which, that accursed depopulator of vast regions, the slave trade carried on by Arabs for the supply of Persia and other Mahometan countries, will be no longer possible. Should the life of Mr. Stanley be spared, which we most devoutly hope it may be, it may confidently be expected that he will not only perfect the unfinished discoveries of Dr. Livingstone, but give us such a knowledge of Eastern Africa generally as must lead to great results, both as regards commerce and the spread of Christian civilization. The facilities which so fine a navigable river as the Rufiji affords for missionary enterprise are so much greater than any that have been previously known to exist in Eastern Africa, that we look with confident expectation to our Missionary Societies to avail themselves of them for spreading the tidings of the Gospel of eternal life among the multitudes who are there perishing for lack of knowledge."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-11-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_11_1874#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Livingstone Congo Inland Mission', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Quoting from that excellent record of missionary effort, Regions Beyond, mention may be made, in the first place, of the fact that this Mission, founded in 1877, is one of the seven important Central African Missions established since the death of Livingstone. It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

If central Africa is ever to advance in civilization, and its inhabitants are to be brought into commercial relations with Europe, one of the best chances of our accomplishing it will, in my opinion, consist in rendering the great White Nile a highway of intercourse and traffic. And if the present ruler of Egypt shall bring about this most desirable end, by putting a stop to the lawless slave-trade, carried on beyond his frontiers under the guise of dealing in ivory, and by establishing marts of commerce on the banks of the great river, Africa will owe more to him than to any ruler since the days of the Roman emperors, who, though they tried, never succeeded in opening out the regions around the head waters of the Nile.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

From the earliest days of the process of presenting Christianity to Africans, some converts had accepted the new faith lock, stock, and barrel. Others, on the other hand, accepted it on the basis of what they already knew, and understood Christianity in terms of the basic underlying concepts of African traditional religion, relating the message of the Church to their enduring religious needs.\nThus Christianity did not come merely to supplant traditional religious beliefs and practices, rather it came to supplement them. In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious. This is why we have termed it indigenous Christianity.\nUnderlying indigenous Christianity is an expression of religious crea› tivity and cultural integrity, and not a mere reaction, response or adaptation to outside stimuli, as some scholars are wont to assert. Usually, and with a few exceptions, the explanation for the emergence and proliferation of movements of indigenous Christianity has been derived from factors outside these movements themselves which has given them a functional reasonableness or a dysfunctional aberrant quality. Such interpretations may not be devoid of validity but they tend to overstress the role of outside factors in the emergence of these movements.

But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible.

Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley. The itinerant Liberian prophet, William Wade Harris, travelled through the Ivory Coast and the Apolonia District of the Gold Coast between 1910 and 1915 and converted some 100 000 people.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

'The local traditional religions of tropical and southern Africa - the cults of the early states - were local in character and tended to separate rather than unite', wrote Dr B. I. Sharevskaya, a Moscow student of African religions. $^{12}$ Christianity with its idea that all men are the children of God made it possible for the new converts to identify with a community larger than an ethnic group. Unity on a new basis was possible only in a milieu which marked a departure from the old forms of unity and saw no way of returning to them. The new converts were in just such a milieu. These were, as a rule, people whose break with tradition and prevailing custom was most complete.

These churches were of two main types, namely, those which broke away from already existing independent churches and those which sprang up independently of any existing religious groups. In most instances, these churches sought to incorporate a larger measure of African beliefs and practices into Christian life than was permitted in churches under missionary control. They were an expression of the desire of Africans to find 'a place to feel at home', and include African ideas of worship in their Christian liturgies. An important causative factor was the translation of the Bible into many African languages and the Africans' reading and interpretation of the Christian Scripture. On the basis of their own under› standing of Holy Scripture, Africans formed or founded their own churches, thus doing away with the monopoly over scriptural interpretation which had been in missionary hands for so long.\nThe breakaway churches, in part, represented the African reaction or adaptation to colonialism and were emancipatory in character. Especially in areas of European settlement, where political repression was intense, such churches proliferated and attracted African nationalists. The Ethiopian churches in South Africa, which emphasize African selfimprovement and political rights, are a case in point. Nehemiah Tile broke away from the Methodist Mission Church in 1882 and two years later founded the Tembu Church,$^{34}$ one of the first independent churches ever to be formed in Africa.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks.

Why are we urging this upon the Government—upon governors, and upon subjects? Because with an increase of the useful power of civilised government in the interior, those roads will also act as a curb to the aggressive instincts of Ashantee—as stimulants to increased production, because affording facilities for increased commerce—as placing the engines of civilization in immediate contact with the hitherto unmitigated barbarous superstitions of Ashantee; and rendering it possible for the missionary society labouring in the protectorate to advance and maintain its outposts, in an efficient state at a considerable distance from the Coast without a ruinous expense, and without that dangerous and weakening isolation which has hitherto almost neutralised the zeal and devotion of its indefatigable agents.\n\nIn such a country as Africa, and among such people as the Africans, the power of Christian civilization must be exhibited wherever there are efforts for inculcating Christianity, if these latter are to have any corresponding success. The creation and maintenance of good roads, where such facilities for intercommunication have hitherto been unknown, would be a great and useful exhibition of the power of Christian civilization. They could not fail surely and more or less rapidly to ameliorate the social condition of a people which, amid tropical luxuriance, suffers most frightful privations. And every stage of that amelioration would be a material argument that all could appreciate in favour of that Christianity which the missionary would be engaged in teaching. Such palpable evidences that Christianity has the ""promise of the life that now is"" will dispose them the more readily to believe that it has also indeed and in truth ""the promise of that which is to come."" And in our humble opinion it is as much the duty of a Christian people to exhibit such material evidences to the heathen, as adjuncts to missionary teaching, as it is their duty to send the latter. The material blessings which God has bestowed upon the world through Christianity ought to be pressed into his service as allies of Gospel truth. These can exercise an influence upon the yet unconverted heathen, and predispose him to listen to those who may be striving for his eternal welfare, although of themselves they are, of course, without any regenerating power; and may even, when unaccompanied by Christianity, only add new vices to the old degradation.'}, {'id': 566, 'article_title': 'Lord Stanley on the Motion for a Special Committee (Western Africa)', 'full_section_title': 'Lord Stanley on the Motion for a Special Committee (Western Africa)', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1865#article-12', 'issue_date': '23_03_1865', 'content': ""Again, we must express our deep regret at but too much of what Lord Stanley thought and uttered.

Many good friends of the African people dissented from our view; but despite the severe commercial trial through which Lagos has had to pass as a direct (though, we believe, not necessary) consequence of the annexation, we have never wavered in our belief that it must become a means to great and eventual good. Notwithstanding all the errors in government, Lagos has been steadily progressing in the evidences of civilised rule. The town has been new planned; many sanitary reforms have been effected; a superior class of dwellings is becoming comparatively common; but among all the evidences there is none which has given us more heartfelt satisfaction than the certainty we now have that a brick church is to be built. We have given elsewhere some brief account of the ceremony of laying the foundation-stone of this edifice by the Administrator of the Colony, Captain John Hawley Glover, R.N. Sincerely and warmly do we congratulate that gentleman on the sentiments then expressed by him. We earnestly recommend the perusal of his address by our readers, not in a spirit of criticism, but of Christian love; and it is not unworthy the attention of those prominent individuals who in the Anthropological Society and elsewhere have ventured to express their faith in Mohammedanism—in the creed of the false prophet—as the destined regenerator of Africa. We hope all our officials—all the servants of the British Crown in Africa, from Governor-General and Administrators downward—will feel with Captain Glover, and express constantly with him, both by words and deeds, that it is indeed ""a great privilege""—""a cause for gratification and thankfulness, that we are permitted by God in his great mercy to be humble instruments in carrying out his scheme for the redemption of the world."" If all the British officials on the Coast of Africa could be brought to feel thus, and would act in accordance with it, how easy and delightful our future task would be. Our heart warms toward Captain Glover when he proclaims that he will ever be forward to dispute his right and privilege to be a willing labourer in the spread of the blessed Gospel of Jesus Christ, and of that civilisation which must more or less accompany it. It is Christ, and his Gospel, and his civilisation alone, that can heal the woes, remove the degradation, and elevate the heart of Africa. The Administrator did well to recall the fact that the people of Great Britain itself were once grovelling in the darkness of a superstition which claimed its human victims, as those of Africa now do; that the people did not emerge from this miserable condition through any effort of their own unassisted powers of reason, or by any progressive enlightenment springing from that superstition itself, but were only rescued by having the Gospel of the Blessed Saviour of mankind brought among them by God\'s agents from a foreign land. Those who brought that Gospel brought also those industries of which they were possessed; and the work of Christian civilisation then commenced has progressed in spite of the evil desires of the human heart, which, as in the case of the African slave-trade, have occasionally darkened its exhibition by a cruel selfishness that ignored the ""mercy, love, and forbearance toward one another"" which, as the Administrator justly showed, should naturally flow from the remembrance of the great love with which Christ hath loved us. Again, we record our thanks to Captain Glover for thus proclaiming the duty and privilege of British officials on the West Coast, as well as of every individual Christian; and if, unhappily, we should have in the future, as in the past, to expose words and acts of officials there in total contempt and forgetfulness of such privilege and duty, we shall be able to point to the Queen\'s Administrator at Lagos as one who condemns them equally with ourselves. We venture, moreover, further to express the hope that the educated Africans on the Coast, all of whom owe their release from ignorance and barbarism to that Christianity which the Administrator justly says ""must prevail because He hath promised it,"" will be animated by love and forbearance toward one another, and toward the yet enslaved heathen around them, which will show the superior beauty of Christianity and will greatly aid in the spread of that civilisation which has already folded them in its embrace.

And although I regret the failure of this Expedition very much indeed, yet I cherish the hope of one day (and that day I trust is not very far distant) seeing that part of Africa opened up to commerce, Christianity, and civilization. The inhabitants of that part of the coast known as Cape Juby are not very numerous; but oh! the wretched condition that they are in, implores the help and sympathy of every Christian. Not only are they shut out from the civilized world, but also from the benefits thereof, social and moral, which are the golden fruits of civilization and Christianity. If you would see mankind in his natural state, with all the natural consequences to which Adam's transgression has subjected him, you would see him there. Yet, notwithstanding all the disadvantages of a dark, benighted country, on which the glorious orb of culture has never dawned, those poor inhabitants of the Great Desert, in manners, civility, and kindness, would unquestionably put to shame very many of our so-called civilized communities in England. They are, indeed, a very kind, affectionate people (I am speaking of the tribes I have seen on the coast); and I am thoroughly persuaded by what I observed of them during my short stay with them, that they would hail with joy the arrival of a missionary expedition upon their coasts. Such an expedition would, I believe, be full of happy results. The natives of Cape Juby are most intellectual in their bearing, and would be easily taught in all the branches of civilization could they only have teachers. And my prayer is, that God would raise up the right sort of men to do the work; men with large hearts, full of love and tender compassion towards their fellow-creatures; such men as David Brainerd, John Williams, Vanderkemp, and others, whose glorious achievements will live on through eternity. There are camels, sheep, and goats in abundance on the coast, which could be made a trade of, the natives being most anxious to trade. Camels could be bought at from three to four pounds each; sheep about two shillings each, for which a ready market could be easily obtained, at Las Palmas, Grand Canary. The merchants of that place are most anxious that that part of Africa should be opened up to civilization and commerce, and would gladly co-operate with, and render every assistance in their power to, any party settling upon the coast. I state this in consequence of a conversation I had with one of the principal merchants in that place, who said to me that the opening up of that part of Africa would do an incalculable measure of good to the islands, the trade of which, owing to the want of a neighbouring market, is at a very low ebb.

Since then, however, it has been literally torn in pieces by internal convulsions, and might possibly even have disappeared from the list of nations, but for the sudden rise of its present king, who, in the course of a few years, has not merely put down all the contending chiefs who perpetually fought for the ascendancy in Amhara and Tigre, but reduced the late sovereignty of Shoa to its original subjugation to the rule of Gondai. Thus Abyssinia is so far become one.\n\n""The King is at the same time rapidly prosecuting internal reforms. He has at this moment lay missionaries at his court attached to the Jerusalem Mission.

Among the political events we are inclined to regard that which has cast down thrones in Germany, and seems to be culminating in a new German Empire, as chief in menace and in promise. It has roused strong animosities, and may lead to new combinations of powers for working out those changes which are coming upon the earth. We have no prophetic spirit—we do not profess to know what even a day or an hour may bring forth; but we feel, and we hope that all our friends both in Europe and in Africa will feel with us, that these are times in which we cannot be too zealous in the performance of those works which have been given us to do. We know that our work is to bring all the forces that we can command to bear for promoting and furthering the Christian civilization of Africa. And if this duty is ours, how much more evidently is it that of every educated African. There is no hope for Africa but in that civilization, as there is scarcely an educated African anywhere who does not owe the education he has received directly or indirectly to Christian effort on behalf of him and of his race. The governing authorities would have left him everywhere in the thraldom of ignorance and degrading superstition, even when freeing him from absolute bodily slavery to his fellow-man; but various Christian organizations have, in obedience to the Divine command, come forward in his behalf and to his rescue, with results which are scoffed at and derided only by those who would have used his race for ever as victims of their interests, and of all those evil passions by the indulgence of which they who are not Christ\'s work out the devil\'s work on earth. This very fact, even supposing no love of Christ in his heart, no religious feeling to have been generated in or brought home to him with the knowledge he has received, ought not only strongly to impress every educated African with a sense of duty, but to show him clearly and unmistakably in what direction his path of duty lies. In striving to advance his own individual earthly interests, whether in science, trade, commerce, agriculture, or manufacture, let him keep constantly in view that all he has received by which he has been made to differ from the most filthy and degraded of the savages of his race, is the fruit of advancing Christian civilization, and of that alone; and keeping this in view he will not, and cannot, fail in combining with exertions for his own personal advantage and aggrandisement, equally constant and strenuous efforts for the spread of that same civilization on the continent and in the islands which he inhabits. European Christians have begun the work among the Africans, and they will not abandon it; those to whom we now write are the first-fruits of that work; but to spread widely abroad among their race the Christian civilization which has been to them individually as the breath of life, raising them up to stand before the world as fellow-men, and vindicate their claim to the equal possession with others of every land and hue of those mental endowments which divide, as by a line of eternal fire, man from the brute—to spread widely abroad this Christian civilization among their fellow Africans, is the task manifestly allotted to Africans. It is on this ground, among others, that we advocated and enforced in our last the assuming by the community of Sierra Leone of the expense of that educational work among them hitherto at the charge of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, that the funds now thus appropriated by those societies may be set free for commencing similar work in other West African districts. And it is on this ground also that we are so anxiously endeavouring to stimulate them to the production and demand among the natives of new articles for commerce. All civilization must have material resources upon which it may feed, by which it may be supported and strengthened. Christian civilization, and bodily filth and misery as the characteristics of the whole mass of the people, cannot co-exist. As the former progresses, the arts of civilization and the ameliorations of civilized existence must go with it; and these cannot go with it unless the earth is made to ""yield her increase"" by the application to it of a certain organized industry, which it will never receive except under the impulse of a trading demand. The natural riches of Western Africa are enormous, and are such as will sooner or later support a commerce to which that at present existing on the Coast is merely fractional; but for this the means must be employed by those whom God is manifestly raising up for the work. And lastly, it is on this ground that we call upon all the European employés of the British Crown in Africa to use the means and power of their position for helping on the educated Africans in that propaganda of civilization of which we have been treating. The Parliamentary Committee of 1865 has declared in favour of the preparation of Africans for self-government; and whatever may have been the opinions previously entertained by governors and others in authority on the Coast, from that moment it has become additionally their duty to bring the educated Africans into consultation and into participation in power, as regards the revenues to be raised among them, and the mode in which and the objects for which those revenues shall be spent.

The day for this is slowly breaking; we who are watching can already perceive its light on the horizon. And when that day once fairly breaks, we believe the triumph of Christian civilization over African barbarism will be a rapid one. The facilities afforded by an enormous European wealth, and the discoveries and appliances of modern science and industry, are so great and varied, that when once the conviction gains, Africa can supply what the world wants, she can afford to pay the agents who wrest it from her stimulated energies, she must have civilization introduced within her, whether she desires it or not—when once, we say, this conviction gains the leading political and commercial minds of the age, then the progress of Africa will be rapid, because the selfishness of civilization embarked in the enterprise will be accompanied by Christian effort, and will be overruled by a directing Providence towards those blessed results which are pointed out on the glowing page of inspired prophesy.

But what hope, we may be asked, is there of their being thus brought to bear upon it speedily? Is not everybody sick of Africa, with the exception of a few enthusiasts and ardent Christians? Are not statesmen and politicians professing their desire to wash their hands of it—to confine themselves merely to their trading watchtowers at certain points, and to leave the seething pots of barbarous and bloody superstitions, and of every moral enormity, to pour their horrid stench into the offended nostrils of civilization, without any effort at purification or control—gathering up their pure skirts, like the priest and Pharisee in the parable, to avoid the touch of the wounded and bleeding Samaritan, who is unworthy of their exalted sympathies?

To this our energies are, now, as they have been for years past, devoted. To those who have not considered the matter as we have, the idea of any rapid advancement in the solution might well seem to be Utopian. We have to deal with countries in which the dense ignorance of superstitious barbarism universally prevails—with countries in which the British people do not settle as colonists, where European mercantile houses trade, but do not leave in them any of the profits, if such there be, of their commerce, and where consequently there is little or no increase of capital that may be devoted to works of improvement. We have to deal with countries in which the action of the British Government has been hitherto simply protective, and not in any degree whatever initiative; ameliorating the condition of the people only in so far as the amelioration is necessary to give protection to trade and commerce at the stations which it occupies, and in the dependent territories, by prohibiting at and within them the outrages to humanity in which the most blood-thirsty superstition known in the world formerly indulged—in abolishing that fruitful source of evil and degradation, domestic slavery, and thus leaving the field open for the civilizing agency of commercial intercourse, the unselfish efforts of philanthropy, and of those religious societies which devote themselves to the promulgation of the glad tidings of salvation among the heathen, diffusing among them the great blessing of education, and enabling them to read those Scriptures of truth on the observance of the sacred precepts contained in which the true happiness of the human race so entirely depends. Great indeed have been and are the advantages thus bestowed upon a portion of the people of West Africa. History necessarily affords no parallel. Ere yet the efforts of the British Government to put an end to the odious foreign slave-trade had been crowned with full success, the application of steam in navigation brought those countries into easy communication with the Christian civilization of Great Britain, which may be said to have swooped down upon them, embracing many of them, educated by the religious societies, in its folds. The easy access to England thus afforded by steam has been largely, and is increasingly, availed of by those who had been thus educated, and who, by trade and commerce introduced among them, have obtained the necessary pecuniary means. Not a few of the children of these have also been sent to Great Britain for education. The civilization of Europe has thus become familiar to many, while still the great masses of the people in and beyond the narrow limits of a few Coast towns remain in the dense darkness of heathen ignorance, and more or less openly the victims of heathen superstitions, without any incentive to industrial action beyond what is necessary for obtaining the commonest necessaries of life. Now those countries in which the peoples are thus left to the natural inertia of ignorant tropical humanity, must,—that is our problem—must be brought within the area of Christian civilization. We say Christian civilization, because there is a species of Mahometan civilization, as in Persia; and of heathen, as in China; neither of which we desire for Africa. How are they to be so brought? How? They cannot be so brought except by the civilization by which, we desire them to be embraced,—advancing to their help, seeking them, searching them out, holding forth to them the hand of fellowship, showing them the material advantages it enjoys, and of which it desires to make them partakers. Year after year have we brooded over this problem, our only consolation meanwhile being that the number of more or less educated natives in the Coast towns was in constant increase; that the education they were receiving, being under missionary superintendence, included some knowledge of the articles of universal Christian belief, and, at least, a theoretical acquaintance with those blessed precepts, even the very imperfect observance of which by the inhabitants of the Christian world has contributed so largely to human happiness by emancipating mankind from the cruel tyranny of evil and bringing them partially into the delicious freedom of righteousness. Those natives, more or less educated, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, were indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection should be arranged. That they are not themselves sufficiently under the dominion of Christian civilization to lead them to become its apostles among their hitherto less favoured countrymen has been sufficiently proved by the reception accorded by some of them in Abeokuta to the proposal made by us to link that town with Lagos by means of a railway. They would none of it. They strove to set the heathen mind against it. They would rather things should remain as they are. The education they have received has only served to develop selfishness in them, by showing them the advantages they possess through it over the heathen among whom they dwell—advantages which they do not wish to see reduced by the introduction of others into that portico of the temple of knowledge in which they have themselves secured a footing. But though their help will be unwillingly given, they will and must nevertheless become an important, as they do also constitute a necessary, element in that onward march of civilization which we have projected. The more and more we have studied the problem, the more and more convinced we become, and are, that the onward march must be by means of railways between British sea-coast possessions and the interior. No half measures will suffice. As a first step toward the working out of our problem, we put forward, some twelve months and more ago, our proposals to construct four light railways: three within the Gold Coast territories proper, and one within native territory, with a British Gold Coast Colony possession as a base. We felt that the publication of these proposals would enable us to test the degree in which the educated African element might be made co-operative in the elucidation. We soon discovered that, with two or three individual exceptions, that element was nowhere sufficiently enlightened to be co-operative in any other way than by its paid employment, whenever we should be ready with the pounds, shillings, and pence with which to make the work a personal benefit to each and all of them. Our proposals did not provoke or awake or create the smallest scintilla of interest or enthusiasm. They fell flat upon the understandings, and did not quicken the pulsations of any heart. Almost every individual fraction of this element seemed to fancy that in some way or other a railway, if introduced, would interfere with or prejudice the little trading or other game in which he was engaged; and, as we have before said, with one or two exceptions, the great broad view of human misery to be relieved, of human happiness to be increased, of human emancipation from the fetters of degrading and debasing evil to be achieved, of human benefits to be bestowed, and of the spread of the knowledge of the great and precious gift of eternal life obtainable through faith in Christ Jesus, never presented itself to mind, or heart, or soul,—engrossed only by its own little personal dust-heap, in which it might be grubbing for its own little personal enjoyments, and the gratification of its own little personal vanities and desires. This discovery, for which we were fully prepared, confirmed our views that Africa can do nothing for herself, and that every...\n**67**', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1880#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general.

With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Thomson agrees with Dr. Blyden as to the causes of these astonishing results.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony. It is signifi› cant that except in North Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar, these languages have remained the official languages even to this very day.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Christianity in the colonial era', 'content': 'The close association of Christianity and education cannot be over› emphasized, for it was through the innumerable schools established by missionaries that many Africans came into contact with Christianity, and in fact school was the church in many parts of Africa.

But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible. The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""Unlike the Roman Catholic ones, the Protestant missions sought tem› poral influence.

The spread of civilization would be an incidental by-product which the palm-oil trade, limited to coastal transactions, could not achieve on its own. 47 Thus the Protestant missions, very much of this world, took on the role of reformers, which included interfering in political and military strategy. The Abeokuta missionaries suggested to England the making of a road to the sea, in order to speed up the barter trade - and the delivery of war material.

From their position of strength, the missions did not object to the rival intrusion of Western administrations, but counterbalanced it by siding with or against the established trade.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'Another interesting economic change in the nineteenth century, also often ignored by scholars, was the completion of the commercial unification of Africa.

That the number and the importance of merchants increased cannot be doubted. What is not clear is the extent to which a merchant or capitalist class may be said to have emerged. The tradition of long-distance trading with caravan centres and organization for security, provisioning, credit facilities, transportation and so on was already well established in North and West Africa and was developing rapidly in Central and East Africa in the nineteenth century. These developments occurred in Islamic areas where book-keeping was in Arabic, as well as in the old slave-trading parts of West Africa where the languages of commerce were European languages, and in areas of East Africa where Swahili was expanding as the language of commerce. There is evidence that in parts of the coastal areas of West Africa slave labour was beginning to be supplemented by expanding older forms of enforced labour, where money is loaned in return for a 'hostage' whose labour served partly as interest on the loan and partly as a guarantee that the loan would eventually be repaid. It was indicative of the increasing importance of the groups of merchants and of banking services that this type of enforced labour was greatly expanded in scope. It is said that by the 1870s on the Gold Coast, the system began to rival slave labour in significance, slavery being the method of recruiting labour from outside the immediate com› munity, and the system of 'hostages' for recruiting labour from within the community itself.$^{22}$ Yet, outside of the North African coastal cities, a distinct merchant class was slow in evolving. In the areas influenced by Christianity and European ideas, a group of merchants similar to the Victorian middle class began to emerge. But even in those places, apart from Sierra Leone and Liberia, such merchants seeking influence and power within the traditional states did so largely by obtaining chieftaincy titles within the evolving state structures. In many parts of the Sudan and Senegambia, the dominant merchants were closely connected with Muslim religious leaders, and there was not a distinct merchant class but rather a clerical merchant class. In other places there was no clear division between the merchants and the warriors and the ruling elite.

Although the data are fragmentary, it is clear that throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries an international network built upon localized trading provided commodities for the Indian Ocean ports dominated by Indian and Muslim merchant capital. Among the most important were ivory from the Luangwa valley and adjacent Undi territory, gold from the mines in the kingdoms of Manica and Changamire and just north of Tete, and copper from the Kafue region.$^{15}$ The scale of this trade seems to have been relatively small and somewhat irregular until the last two decades of the eighteenth century. The eastward thrust of the Lunda of Kazembe and their commercial alliance with the Bisa, the intensified activities of Yao merchants from the coast, and the commercial expansion of the Chikunda traders from the Zambezi prazos dramatically increased the level of exports to the Indian Ocean entrepôts. All three groups acquired substantial quantities of ivory and slaves for the world market, setting the stage for the progressive incorporation into the larger world economy, which was based almost entirely on the exchange of these two commodities for European manu› factured goods. 16 Transformation in the political and economic systems often generated parallel changes in the social and ethnic composition of Central African societies.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders.

At this time, trade in slaves (which had not been prominent under the Kamba) seems to have become more important.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

The greatest expansion of Islam in pre-colonial times took place in the nineteenth century, in part when Islamic militants who were dissatisfied with the intolerable accommodations Islam had made with traditional African religion declared holy wars aimed at firmly restoring the Islamic faith to its original purity. These djihäds led to the formation of theocratic states in which Islamic religion and law were imposed on the people, and this led to widespread conversions. These theocratic states extended across the Sudanic zone of West Africa from Senegal to what is now northern Nigeria, and included Futa Jallon, Futa Toro, the Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire. 4\nIn East Africa, Islam moved from the coast into the interior, but unlike their counterparts in West Africa, Muslims in East Africa appear to have been more interested in trade than in converting people to their faith. They concentrated on maintaining their trade links with the interior and perpetuating their economic spheres of influence. Some parts of East Africa had, however, adopted Islam over the centuries; and along the coast, a new culture developed, and it was out of the mixture of Bantu with Muslim culture that the Swahili culture was born. The Swahili language is today the lingua franca of most of East Africa.\nIslam had made considerable advances before the arrival of the colonial powers. Among them may be mentioned the replacement in many parts of Africa of the traditional cycle of festivals with the Islamic calendar and the adoption of many Arabic loan words and concepts into African languages such as Hausa, Fula and Mandinka leading to their enrichment. Pilgrims returning from pilgrimages had adopted new fashions in dress and together with the example of visiting and resident Muslim scholars and holy men in many parts of Africa, Arabic culture had begun to make a considerable impact on Africans.

Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained.

It is true that I have been on the West Coast, but I have served in a public capacity at a distance from the Gambia. Whether the Gaboon should be taken in exchange by us for the Gambia, or whether the Gambia should be handed over to the flag of France, in order that Sierra Leone or the Gold Coast or Lagos may remain intact for positive or imaginary purposes of trade, is a matter of absolute indifference to myself beyond and save the fact that my conviction, formed on the spot, is, that the French are unable to offer us a scrap of territory on the West African Coast at all adequate to the loss which would be nationally sustained by the surrendering of the grand river washing our old and most loyal colony of the Gambia.\n\nWe must never forget that the Gambia is the point of the tropics nearest to Europe owned by England, and that in a fortnight, or certainly three weeks, a steamer from Bathurst can be running up the Thames at Blackwall. The soil of the Gaboon is not one whit more productive than the country around the Gambia; and, moreover, our standard flies and our name has a very wholesome significance quite 400 miles inland from Cape St. Mary. Nothing of the same kind—morally, socially, politically—can be stated of the Gaboon. There our ensign is a figment beyond a league of the sea, and the sound of the English tongue is unheard; while the hold which our Protestant faith has on the native tribes of the Gambia is an aesthetical thing not to be breathed in the midst of the Roman Catholic benefactions of the Gaboon. No doubt Mr. Walker may have arguments strong enough to pooh-pooh that; but though trade must be the pioneer of civilization in Africa, religion cannot be set aside as of no moment in the legitimate direction and development of that trade. Besides, I hardly think that Lord Carnarvon could commit so ineffable a blunder as the exchange of the Gambia for any West African possession which France can tender in the light of a bait; and surely the Government which is expanding the area of our colonial empire ought to be the last to attempt to contract it.\n\nThe tribes of the Gambia are attached to us, are affected by our customs, are not insensible of the benefits accruing to them by the administration of our laws, and are not altogether unmoved by the lessons of Protestantism.\n\nThese are sentiments—trifles although some will deem them—deserving of consideration before the Gambia is pitchforked into the lap of Republican and Roman Catholic France.'}, {'id': 5099, 'article_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'last_edit_date': '02-16-1885', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_05_1885', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.'}]","[{'document_title': ""CHRISTMAS-DAY AND NEW YEAR'S DAY."", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that will have closed before this paper can reach the hands of our African readers has been one marked by great and important events in Europe, which, as the chief field of Christian profession, may naturally be expected to undergo startling and terrible visitations as the world draws nearer and nearer to that end to which we have pointed. Among the political events we are inclined to regard that which has cast down thrones in Germany, and seems to be culminating in a new German Empire, as chief in menace and in promise. It has roused strong animosities, and may lead to new combinations of powers for working out those changes which are coming upon the earth. We have no prophetic spirit—we do not profess to know what even a day or an hour may bring forth; but we feel, and we hope that all our friends both in Europe and in Africa will feel with us, that these are times in which we cannot be too zealous in the performance of those works which have been given us to do. We know that our work is to bring all the forces that we can command to bear for promoting and furthering the Christian civilization of Africa. And if this duty is ours, how much more evidently is it that of every educated African. There is no hope for Africa but in that civilization, as there is scarcely an educated African anywhere who does not owe the education he has received directly or indirectly to Christian effort on behalf of him and of his race. The governing authorities would have left him everywhere in the thraldom of ignorance and degrading superstition, even when freeing him from absolute bodily slavery to his fellow-man; but various Christian organizations have, in obedience to the Divine command, come forward in his behalf and to his rescue, with results which are scoffed at and derided only by those who would have used his race for ever as victims of their interests, and of all those evil passions by the indulgence of which they who are not Christ\'s work out the devil\'s work on earth. This very fact, even supposing no love of Christ in his heart, no religious feeling to have been generated in or brought home to him with the knowledge he has received, ought not only strongly to impress every educated African with a sense of duty, but to show him clearly and unmistakably in what direction his path of duty lies. In striving to advance his own individual earthly interests, whether in science, trade, commerce, agriculture, or manufacture, let him keep constantly in view that all he has received by which he has been made to differ from the most filthy and degraded of the savages of his race, is the fruit of advancing Christian civilization, and of that alone; and keeping this in view he will not, and cannot, fail in combining with exertions for his own personal advantage and aggrandisement, equally constant and strenuous efforts for the spread of that same civilization on the continent and in the islands which he inhabits. European Christians have begun the work among the Africans, and they will not abandon it; those to whom we now write are the first-fruits of that work; but to spread widely abroad among their race the Christian civilization which has been to them individually as the breath of life, raising them up to stand before the world as fellow-men, and vindicate their claim to the equal possession with others of every land and hue of those mental endowments which divide, as by a line of eternal fire, man from the brute—to spread widely abroad this Christian civilization among their fellow Africans, is the task manifestly allotted to Africans. It is on this ground, among others, that we advocated and enforced in our last the assuming by the community of Sierra Leone of the expense of that educational work among them hitherto at the charge of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, that the funds now thus appropriated by those societies may be set free for commencing similar work in other West African districts. And it is on this ground also that we are so anxiously endeavouring to stimulate them to the production and demand among the natives of new articles for commerce. All civilization must have material resources upon which it may feed, by which it may be supported and strengthened. Christian civilization, and bodily filth and misery as the characteristics of the whole mass of the people, cannot co-exist. As the former progresses, the arts of civilization and the ameliorations of civilized existence must go with it; and these cannot go with it unless the earth is made to ""yield her increase"" by the application to it of a certain organized industry, which it will never receive except under the impulse of a trading demand. The natural riches of Western Africa are enormous, and are such as will sooner or later support a commerce to which that at present existing on the Coast is merely fractional; but for this the means must be employed by those whom God is manifestly raising up for the work. And lastly, it is on this ground that we call upon all the European employés of the British Crown in Africa to use the means and power of their position for helping on the educated Africans in that propaganda of civilization of which we have been treating. The Parliamentary Committee of 1865 has declared in favour of the preparation of Africans for self-government; and whatever may have been the opinions previously entertained by governors and others in authority on the Coast, from that moment it has become additionally their duty to bring the educated Africans into consultation and into participation in power, as regards the revenues to be raised among them, and the mode in which and the objects for which those revenues shall be spent.

The inhabitants of that part of the coast known as Cape Juby are not very numerous; but oh! the wretched condition that they are in, implores the help and sympathy of every Christian. Not only are they shut out from the civilized world, but also from the benefits thereof, social and moral, which are the golden fruits of civilization and Christianity. If you would see mankind in his natural state, with all the natural consequences to which Adam's transgression has subjected him, you would see him there. Yet, notwithstanding all the disadvantages of a dark, benighted country, on which the glorious orb of culture has never dawned, those poor inhabitants of the Great Desert, in manners, civility, and kindness, would unquestionably put to shame very many of our so-called civilized communities in England. They are, indeed, a very kind, affectionate people (I am speaking of the tribes I have seen on the coast); and I am thoroughly persuaded by what I observed of them during my short stay with them, that they would hail with joy the arrival of a missionary expedition upon their coasts. Such an expedition would, I believe, be full of happy results. The natives of Cape Juby are most intellectual in their bearing, and would be easily taught in all the branches of civilization could they only have teachers. And my prayer is, that God would raise up the right sort of men to do the work; men with large hearts, full of love and tender compassion towards their fellow-creatures; such men as David Brainerd, John Williams, Vanderkemp, and others, whose glorious achievements will live on through eternity. There are camels, sheep, and goats in abundance on the coast, which could be made a trade of, the natives being most anxious to trade. Camels could be bought at from three to four pounds each; sheep about two shillings each, for which a ready market could be easily obtained, at Las Palmas, Grand Canary. The merchants of that place are most anxious that that part of Africa should be opened up to civilization and commerce, and would gladly co-operate with, and render every assistance in their power to, any party settling upon the coast. I state this in consequence of a conversation I had with one of the principal merchants in that place, who said to me that the opening up of that part of Africa would do an incalculable measure of good to the islands, the trade of which, owing to the want of a neighbouring market, is at a very low ebb. The distance between Cape Juby and Las Palmas is somewhere betwixt eighty and a hundred miles. A schooner of fifty or sixty tons can, with a fair wind, make the distance in twelve hours. Then there is an excellent harbour at Cape Juby, with an average depth at high water of eighteen to twenty feet inside the bar.

They have systematically opposed every effort of the European or even educated African merchant and trader to establish commercial or other relations with the interior. They seal this up, as it were, from the intrusion of civilization and Christianity, in order that they may preserve their monopoly of trade. In the same way that, previous to 1835, they monopolized the supply of slaves to the ships of the odious foreign slavetraders, so do they now monopolize all trade relations with the interior. Yet, these are not powerful or even large communities. At none of the places above-mentioned do they number more than a few thousands, chiefly slaves of a very limited number of kings, chiefs, and head men—the traders. It is now forty years, more or less, since these oil-exporting towns came under treaty arrangements with Great Britain for the discontinuance of the slave-trade, and the carrying on of legitimate commerce, under the supervision and protection of a British Consul and the commanders of Her Majesty's ships of war.

With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS COMMISSIONERSHIP', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told.

Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As to the elevating effects of Islam, hear the evidence of Mr. Joseph Thomson, the African explorer, who writes, he says, ""as one having the interests of Christianity deeply at heart.""

Dealing, first, with European influences, Mr. Thomson says: ""It is a painful fact to admit, but there is no shirking the naked reality, that in West Africa our influence for evil enormously counterbalances any little good we may have produced by our contact with the African.""

Land and property in the town appreciated in value, and craft industries and trade opened the way to personal prosperity. Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade.

Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics.

Learning belonged to the people who attended the missions, and the advantages that came from taking part made them into a privileged class. But they conformed to a pattern already familiar to the local chiefs, not all of whom approved. Some, however, paraded a superficial Westernization in their dress, their homes, their food and drink and their way of life. The missions' purpose was to create a middle class in order to cream off an elite, which would then be trained on Western lines, and would secure and expand the twoway flow of trade to and from the coast. The spread of civilization would be an incidental by-product which the palm-oil trade, limited to coastal transactions, could not achieve on its own. 47 Thus the Protestant missions, very much of this world, took on the role of reformers, which included interfering in political and military strategy.

The main emphasis was laid, at first, on the production of food, and especially of rice, but efforts were also directed towards the cultivation of export crops and the exploitation of local natural resources: in the first category there were sugar, ginger and indigo, and in the second there were coffee and exotic timber. An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper. Here again, the main interest lay in the creation of a reliable economic substitute for the slave trade: in 1824 fifty Western ships loaded 200000 dollars' worth of timber in the Sierra Leone estuary.$^{38}$ Favourable conditions combined to create a certain amount of wealth (it can hardly be described as capital) within the colony. Its ships began to ply the waters along the West African coast as far as the Bight of Biafra. Foreign ships were thenceforth able to put in safely to ports in the estuary for the purpose of the legitimate trade so earnestly desired by the abolitionists. However, the significance of this 'take-off' should not be exaggerated: it simply showed that the experiment was viable, with a minimum of administrative support from the European metropolis.\nAll things considered, the British government's action in 1853 in making the Sierra Leoneans subjects of the Crown represented implicit recognition of the fact that a heterogeneous medley of cultures had been welded together into a viable Creole society.

They tried to exercise some influence through the trusts or credits they gave to Efik traders; and sometimes used economic sanctions by collectively suspending trade with any defaulting Efik merchant. But when, in the nineteenth century, the Efik began to quarrel among themselves, the traders came in as arbitrators and kingmakers.\nMissionaries of the Church of Scotland Mission reached Calabar in 1846. They formed a little self-governing colony of five to six white missionaries, teachers, staff, and converts, at Duke Town and Creek Town.

But the missionaries also watched the local scene, and reported develop› ments to the British consul, or tried to exercise moral influence and to intervene in other ways.\nSince the Cross river estuary was so accessible to the British Preventive Naval Squadron at Fernando Po, it was comparatively easy to stop the slave trade at Calabar.

The creation of Liberia was the result of philanthropic and civilizing aspirations, but also of a desire to mitigate the expansion of the black population in the USA, which was regarded as dangerous.\nA mere handful of settlers defended their settlement against opposition from the local chiefs. The latter disputed that they had given up either their lands or their sovereignty, and also the black foreigners' aim of cutting down the main overseas commercial activity carried on in the area, namely the slave trade. The Reverend Jehudi Ashmun stood up to this opposition with 450 settlers, 200 of whom were liberated Africans. This defensive action proved the saving of the settlement; and in 1824 it was given the name of Liberia, with Monrovia as its main centre. A political charter was drawn up in the USA and administered by the local governor according to his own interpretation of it. When ships arrived, whether American or not, Ashmun set them to trading legally in ivory, timber, skins and oil in return for traditional Western goods.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Ethiopia', 'content': 'the medical field, mainly by missionaries, notably the United Presbyterian Church of North America, the Seventh Adventist Mission, and the Italian Catholic Mission, all of which operated hospitals in Addis Ababa, while the Sudan Interior Mission ran a leprosarium at Akaki.$^{75}$ Other developments included the creation of a small civil service, partly formed with students returning from abroad, which received salaries instead of the revenues from fiefs, and the increasing replacement of tribute in kind by taxes in cash. A decree to curtail labour services from the peasant was enacted in 1934, and legislation for the reform of the land tax in 1935. Efforts at modernization were, however, by then overshadowed by the impending threat of Italian Fascist invasion. 76 Thus the period between 1915 and 1935 witnessed a wider spread and a greater degree of economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia than before. However, this change did not amount to much and both countries therefore remained economically backward and socially undevel› oped. Finally, investment by foreign nationals and firms in commercial, agricultural and mining enterprises was greater in Liberia than in Ethiopia; and while it aided the processes of modernization, it also led to greater foreign control of the Liberian economy than was the case in Ethiopia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Economic zones and trading networks', 'content': ""They set up trading centres (e.g. Lukolele), went down the river as far as the Tio markets on the Pool, travelled upstream into the interior, collecting ivory and slaves, especially from the Mongo.

The Ovimbundu highlands were linked to the coast by another route that led to Caconda and Benguela.

The production areas, though sometimes 400-500 km distant, were mostly near the coast. Transactions were personal between local chiefs, caravaneers, brokers and agents. In Dahomey, on the other hand, the slave trade was one of the mainstays of the ruling house, which delegated the running of it to its chief vassals. In 1818 King Gezo, who was in debt to the Brazilian mulatto Francisco Felix Da Souza, appointed Da Souza as chacha, a 'white-man's chief who acted as an economic adviser and administrator of the Whydah trade. This office survived the death of the first chacha in 1849 and was inherited by Da Souza's son. It was management on a grand scale: the chachas kept a stock of Western goods, offset bookkeeping debits and credits, prepared cargoes in advance to facilitate speedy loading, collected taxes, checked the movements of white foreigners, and provided entertainment for their customers. This economic apparatus was capable of being adapted to other types of produce. Produce for the slave trade, which was in the hands of the chiefs, was secured by annual military expeditions, not always victorious, against the neighbouring countries, principally the Yoruba. It also came from the Central Sudan - whence captives were distributed, moreover, to the north and to Egypt - by caravans, which split up their loads at the border: the blacks earmarked for export, who were strong, were kept aside and incorporated in the ordinary porterage teams.$^{25}$ Further east, from Badagry to the borders of the kingdom of Benin, prolonged strife among the Yoruba people glutted the Whydah market. Local rulers and the black and white slave-traders of the lagoons supplied the heavy demand from the Portuguese and Brazilians, who made the best part of their fortune out of it before turning their hands to other kinds of trade. 26 East of Cape Formosa, among the rivers of the Niger delta from the Nun to Old Calabar, the slave trade was still run by the remarkable machinery that came into play in the last third of the eighteenth century, though this was already being applied to other types of trade that were carried on simultaneously.

Except the yearly wages of 6l. doled out to the ordained minister, not a farthing of the 400l. is included in the amount spent on the building or for any other purpose.\n\nConsidering the grant which is given to the schools in connection with this society by the Government, and the unprogressiveness of this society, the shabbiness of the students\' dress, and the menial drudgery to which the students are subjected, one cannot avoid the conclusion that there is a laxity of principle in those who have ""kept on this grand religious and educational machinery for less than 400l. a-year."" It is the unanimous wish of the majority of the members that they should have the privilege to open free and uncluttered correspondence with the Home Mission; they submit that the practice of transmitting communications through the financial agent is fraught with disadvantage; and in order that the labour already expended may not be lost on Sierra Leone Mission, let this practice be abolished, let the whole machinery be narrowly scrutinized, and then the Sierra Leone Mission will inhale a purer atmosphere, which will give satisfaction to the members, most of whom have every reason to be dissatisfied.—I am, Sir, yours truly,  \nA MEMBER.'}, {'id': 3903, 'article_title': 'Letter from North Carolina, United States', 'full_section_title': 'Letter from North Carolina, United States', 'last_edit_date': '10-22-1879', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1879#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_12_1879', 'content': 'Mr. FitzGerald, many a midnight have you paced your room with tears in your eyes, weeping for Africa.

It is my humble opinion that every station in the Niger Mission should be furnished with white men as in the early days of the Sierra Leone Mission, when our liberated fathers and mothers received such unbounded kindnesses from the hands of the Missionary, and they did their work not with eye-service, or made the Ministry a means to heap up wealth, but they spent even all their living upon our parents as their adopted children. Every Native in West Africa, either in Church or State, owes his position to the goodness of the white people, whilst hardly any Native minister has used his influence to bless another. I pray for the time when every station in the Niger will have European missionaries stationed in them.

As must be well known to our readers, this colony was established about a hundred years ago, with the twofold purpose of providing a home, under British protection, for liberated slaves, and at the same time affording a starting-place from which the interior tribes might be reached, and gradually brought under the influence of civilization and Christianity. The improved condition of popular opinion upon the question of the Slave Trade has done away with the need contemplated in the first intention of its founders; but the second and more important part which was to be performed by the founding of this settlement, still remains, at least to a great extent, unfulfilled. In another column will be found some interesting particulars of the present depressed condition of Sierra Leone—a result brought about by the want of purpose manifested by those in charge—and showing the urgent need there is for opening up trade routes between the coast and the interior tribes, who, there is good reason to believe, will be only to ready to enter into commercial relations with the British and native traders on the coast. The Colonial Government—acting, there is reason to believe, on instructions received from the Home authorities—have not been so energetic in this direction as could be looked for, considering the importance of the interests committed to them. It is absolutely necessary for the future well-being and usefulness of the colony that means be taken by which the lawless and uncivilized tribes who surround the settlement should be brought to feel that their mutual jealousies and tribal disputes shall be no longer permitted, by blocking the trade routes through their regions, to interfere with the commerce that would otherwise be carried on between the settlement and the races beyond them. Sir Samuel Rowe's recent action seems to indicate that he is determined to break through precedent where necessary for the well-being of the people under his charge; and though it would appear that he has not met with all the success that was to be hoped for, at least he has shown these lawless tribes that we can and will interfere where necessary for the protection of our interests, and the benefit of the more civilized peoples further away. Some of these races, separated from our colony by this zone of lawlessness, have given evidence more than once of a desire for commerce with our people. Only a short time before the reappointment of Sir Samuel Rowe as Governor, messengers arrived at Freetown from the powerful Chief, named Shahmadoo, of Beri, a place 800 or 900 miles in the interior, beyond Footah. We hear that this Shahmadoo had a large army with him, and had already advanced some distance towards the coast, having expressed his determination, if necessary, to fight the whole way along, and, indeed, that he had already arrived to within a hundred miles of Freetown. He was very desirous that some European officer should be deputed by the authorities to accompany the messengers back with him. His request, however, was not complied with, which is to be regretted, as he professed that his only object was to open up communications between the settlement and his own people, who appear to be a tribe of the Western Soudan. Their country has not been visited by Europeans during the last thirty years, and we are told that they have large stores of gold, ivory, and other commodities, which might be exchanged with profit in Sierra Leone. Taking the account of these people for what it is worth, this, at least, seems to be clear, that there are in the interior races much more highly civilized than those nearer the coast, who will be quite ready directly the opportunity is given them of engaging in commerce with our West Coast settlements, and thus relieving them of the great depression under which they have lately been languishing."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sierra Leone and Its People', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following interesting account is extracted from one of a series of articles at present appearing in the *Manchester Examiner*, under the heading of ""Leaves from a Traveller’s Note-book"":—\n\nSierra Leone, our most flourishing colony on the West African Coast, owes its existence to the measures attending the suppression of the slave trade. There was a settlement there before the British Government commenced its crusade against the traffic in human beings, but the population was very small, and the colony had a precarious existence until it was placed under the control of the African Institution, an organization established for the improvement of the western part of Africa. This body, which had the support of all the great men engaged in the anti-slavery movement in England, directed its efforts to the amelioration of the condition of the freed slaves, and did in its time an immense amount of good. Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, was made the head-quarters of the association on the coast, and the captured slaves were landed and settled there. An idea of the extent to which this kind of colonization was carried may be gathered from the fact that the total number of slaves emancipated at Sierra Leone between June, 1819, and January, 1833, was 27,697. The exertions of the association were not merely directed to the settlement of the slaves. A system of education was inaugurated, and the settlers were trained in useful arts. The funds of the association were not always well employed, but the general result of their operations is highly satisfactory, and such as to reflect high honour upon the benevolence of the English people. Sierra Leone is now a flourishing colony, and its inhabitants are further advanced on the paths of civilization than, perhaps, any other body of Africans. Education is widely diffused amongst the community, and many of the higher classes have obtained academic distinction in England, and risen to positions of eminence in their own country. In every walk of life, descendants of emancipated slaves are distinguishing themselves, and justifying the confidence of those who believe in the possibility of the civilization of the negro race.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is quite impossible for us to dismiss the very important subject of a deficiency of public revenue at Sierra Leone with the brief notice taken of it in our last. The interesting communications that we have lately inserted, made by persons but too deeply concerned in the Educational department of the colony, on which, with that of religious teaching—the Native Pastorate—the earliest discomforts of the position seem to have fallen, in strict accordance with the old official principles of government in the colony, appeal too strongly to our well-known sympathies and convictions to allow of our doing so. We have received so many letters during the last few months, in which the writers give most saddening pictures of the moral state and condition of the colony, which our personal experience of a too prevalent dishonesty only too fully confirms, that we look upon the curtailment of education and of public religious teaching with the most serious alarm for the future of the colony and for the reputation of Sierra Leoneans everywhere down the Coast. We are quite aware that the old enemies of the African people will point to those conditions of individual mind and practice which our correspondents stigmatize, and of which we complain, and say, ""Education and religious teaching, forsooth! behold the fruits of them; we have had too much of them already. Some of the greatest cheats are men who have more than any other a redundancy of Scripture phrases at the tip of their tongue."" But they are grossly mistaken. Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people. But that retrenchment, on which we feel thus bound to insist, ought never to have touched the School Department or the Native Pastorate. This is indeed beginning at the wrong end.

The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running. We are convinced that there is a more excellent way, and we regret it has not more generally approved itself to those who have done such good work in other respects in this part of Africa. Other bodies, and notably the Roman Catholics, seem to be far ahead of us in this respect. How far they fail in developing the minds and consciences of the Africans we will not here discuss; but their systems of technical training are thoroughly worthy of imitation.""\n\nThe Bishop goes on to explain that the work that has been accomplished is by no means to be deprecated—indeed, it is\n\ndifficult to imagine how low Sierra Leone must have fallen, mentally and morally, were it not for the mission work carried on in face of such grave difficulties, and upon a soil necessarily so unpromising, since the first occupation of the Colony 107 years ago.

The Upper Mendi, Konno, and Kuranko districts furnish a wide field for commercial enterprise. Manchester woven goods and cotton have scarcely found their way there and where an article is offered which meets a felt want, it is surprising how quickly the Natives acquire it. The eastern portions of the protectorate, which consist of highlands, with a bracing and salubrious climate, are adapted for the cultivation of coffee, ginger, and other valuable products. Another means for the development of the resources of the country would be the settlement of Natives with capital from Sierra Leone and elsewhere, who would carry on such kinds of agriculture. The aborigines live only for the present; they cannot see the force of cultivating plants such as the coffee for the fruits of which they must wait for four or more years. Though slave raiding has ceased, the chiefs still exercise despotic powers, hence there is no security of tenure, and the people are discouraged from making provision for the future; but a closer control by the Government will do away with this feeling of insecurity. Already I have observed in the Sanda Lokko and other districts the cultivation of young kola trees along the approaches to the villages and towns, but this industry might be very much enlarged; and in the hands of enlightened Natives it might be made remunerative. The principal trade routes from beyond the Protectorate are those which enter it across our northern frontier through the French posts at Herimakunna and Wossu. On the eastern frontier between Herimakunna and Kanre Lahun practically no trade passes along them, owing to the deserted condition of the country. From Kanre Lahun a certain amount of trade is done with the interior at the market in the Bandeh country, but this trade is only intermittent. Along the frontier on the Liberian side from Kanre Lahun to the coast of Manoh Salija there is a constant state of warfare, and the border district is a desert. During my recent tour there appeared to be a revival of trade with the interior across our northern frontier, and the number of caravans that came down was unprecedented; but the future prospects of this trade are uncertain, and its continuance cannot be counted on, nor have the products which have come down had an effect in relieving the depressed condition of the market. Considering how very sparsely inhabited are the regions of the Upper Niger it is possible that the trade from that direction is over-rated.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From the report of the Colonial Secretary of Sierra Leone for 1896, which has just been published, it appears that the revenue was £97,109, of which £76,888 was derived from Customs duties, while the expenditure was £116,183—an excess due to certain unforeseen expenses, among them the cost of the Anglo-French Boundary Commission. At the end of the year, however, the total assets of the colony exceeded the liabilities by £19,355; but Sierra Leone contributes nothing to the cost of maintaining the local troops, which last year amounted to £64,421. The total value of the imports last year was £494,688, of which four-fifths came from the United Kingdom. Geneva and rum are the most important articles in the import trade; last year they showed a large decrease, but the increase in other articles, especially cotton goods and hardware, were so great that on the whole year there was an increase of 16 per cent. in imports. The exports amounted to £449,038, a slight decrease on the previous year. This was in the export of African produce, due in great measure to the action of some Native chiefs in the protectorate who were discontented with the new arrangements for levying duties on spirits, and prohibited their people from gathering and selling the produce. Half the total export trade is with the United Kingdom. It has been ascertained during the year that there are large tracts of country in the protectorate in which the valuable rubber-tree, *Kicksia Africana,* abounds. The construction of the railway between Freetown and Songo Town has been commenced, and good progress has been made. A protectorate was proclaimed in August over certain territories adjacent to the colony within the British sphere of influence. The area is about 30,000 square miles, and the population is estimated at from a quarter to half a million. The protectorate is divided for police purposes into five districts; three different kinds of Courts were established—those of the Native chiefs, those in which the chiefs and the District Commissioner sit together, and those of the District Commissioner alone. All civil cases and the lesser criminal ones go to the Native chiefs; the mixed Court tries all graver criminal matters, while the District Commissioner alone tries all cases in which persons who are not Natives are concerned. All capital cases go to the Supreme Court of the Colony, as well as certain specified offences, such as witchcraft, slave-raiding and slave dealing, faction or tribal fights, and the like. The revenue of the protectorate is derived from licenses and a house tax. The staff in each district consists of a District Commissioner, surgeon, and company of frontier police. Prior to the creation of the protectorate, order was maintained by the frontier police, which within the last few years has quelled all inter-tribal warfare and slave-raiding, and reduced the country to peace and security. The effect of the further establishment of British administration and tribunals has been the movement of a number of Natives from the coast into the interior with the purpose of trading, and there is therefore every hope of an increasing development of the natural products of the protectorate in the near future.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-11-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_11_1897#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Copy of the Report of Col.

This has been done by treaties, which stipulate that the slave trade shall be abolished, that perfect freedom of trade shall be allowed in their countries, and their canoes permitted to come to our ports; that British subjects shall be protected, and if they commit offences, shall be sent to Sierra Leone for trial. In return they receive stipends varying from 5l. to 100l., and involving a total cost to the local Government of nearly 1,400l. a-year. It was urged by the Chamber of Commerce that this money was ill bestowed, but this is not established on inquiry. No doubt some of the treaties are with chiefs whose influence has greatly diminished since they were entered into; and, as no provision was made for such a contingency, there may be a few cases out of the whole seventy-nine in which the stipend is paid without an adequate return.\n\nIn the majority of instances, however, this is not the case; the treaties are generally faithfully observed, and, where they are broken by the people, it is found that a threat of withdrawing his subsidy has generally the effect of inducing the chief to compel the offenders to make restitution.\n\nIt is unquestionable that by means of these treaties the Sierra Leone Government exercises an influence over a large extent of country from which it would otherwise be excluded—an influence which is most useful in securing the safety of its trade and the protection of its people, as well as enabling it to interfere on occasions between the natives themselves, not only greatly to their advantage, but often for the security and peace of the settlement.\n\nThe slave-trade, understanding thereby the export of slaves to America, is unknown in Sierra Leone; but as domestic slavery exists in every part of the continent not under British rule, it has constantly happened that the natives, whilst engaged in transporting purchased or kidnapped slaves from one part of the country to another, find they have brought themselves within the reach of British authority, which at once restores their slaves to liberty."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""MR.

The necessity of some great development of Sierra Leone mercantile resources has long been evident. The encroachments of the French in the neighbouring rivers greatly hinder that development; and it cannot be thought probable that the aids to Sierra Leone revenue now given by the Sherbro' countries will permanently continue. In Sherbro' everything seems to have been sacrificed to secure a large surplus revenue to augment the income of Sierra Leone. In many admirable communications from Sherbro' we have long since exposed the injustice with which that dependency has been treated. It is a country of great resources, but those resources are crippled by the disadvantages under which merchants and traders have there laboured, owing to the meagre and ill-paid official staff, the want of adequate protection, and the neglect of those improvements for which the duties levied on its trade would provide, and to which it is therefore justly entitled. It is self-evident that in the near future a much larger proportion of the amount annually derived from those duties must be spent in Sherbro'; that the much-needed improvements cannot be longer delayed; that there must be a largely-increased and better-paid staff; more expenditure for sanitary measures and for the supply of adequate public buildings; or that the Sherbro' must have a separate administration, as in the Gambia, when the whole of the revenue levied will have to be expended in the Sherbro' itself. The question of resources of Sierra Leone proper becomes therefore one of yearly increasing importance.

Again, traders from the Susu country and Futa Yallon used to drive cattle to Freetown, barter them there for trade guns, powder, and Manchester goods, proceed up country—preferably to those parts where slave raiding and tribal wars were going on—purchase the captives taken, and return with them to their own country. All this trade is now stopped, and I do not suppose any right-minded person can regret it when he considers the iniquities of the slave traffic. During my tour last year in the interior I released several parties of slaves consisting of men, women, and children, either shackled with chains or led along tied to one another with halters round their necks. Another cause of the depression has been attributed to the attitude assumed by the domestic slaves, who are not so subservient as formerly to their masters, who find it difficult to get them to gather the produce and send it to the markets. However, I have found that those masters who treat their slaves kindly do not lose them. Hundreds of slaves come every week to Freetown with trade canoes across from Bullom and the adjacent shores, and I have heard no complaints of their deserting their masters. A third cause assigned is the influx of Natives from the interior and the emigration of labourers. It is estimated that 6,000 labourers have proceeded to the Congo since the commencement of the year. This emigration may affect the producing power, but numbers of these labourers return with their wages, which they spend in the Colony; and those who come to Freetown and obtain work there convert their earnings into goods and return with them to their masters. The cessation of the raids and wars which supplied the slave traders, and the entire prohibition of the traffic, must revolutionise the system of trade, and probably accounts for some of the depression that has prevailed, which has been even more felt in French Guinea, as I am informed, than in the Colony of Sierra Leone.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Colony of Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': '| Year | United Kingdom | Colonies | Foreign | Total |\n|------|----------------|----------|---------|-------|\n| 1887 | £247,764       | £1,933   | £58,351 | £308,038 |\n| 1888 | 190,529        | 1,211    | 58,407  | 250,147 |\n| 1889 | 210,800        | 1,110    | 65,871  | 277,781 |\n| 1890 | 295,012        | 1,627    | 93,269  | 389,908 |\n| 1891 | 345,031        | 2,145    | 106,202 | 453,378 |\n\nOf the imports in 1891 that entered for home consumption was £298,137, merchandise warehoused amounted to £146,553, and £8,688 worth of goods was transhipped.

The exports to the United Kingdom in 1891 was four times that to France, five times that to Germany, and twenty-five times that to the United States of America. These figures afford evidence that the trade of the Colony is expanding, a satisfactory feature in a community in which about one-sixth of the resident inhabitants is engaged in trading. Probably the large importations of recent years are not altogether the outcome of increased local consumption, as nearly one-half the imports find their way into the interior countries, and should more properly be classified as transit trade, the few ports in the Colony being mere commercial depots, where are landed the merchandise brought by vessels from different countries, whose manufactures find a market in this part of West Africa. Therefore the stability of the trade of Sierra Leone rests on the pacification of the producing areas which border upon it.\n\nFreetown has become noted as a coaling station, and as it possesses an admirable harbour, a good provision market, and plenty of pure drinking water, it is much frequented by ships, as such supplies cannot be so readily obtained elsewhere on the coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1893#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Natural Products of Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Much interesting and useful information may be gleaned from the Colonial Office report lately issued with reference to Sierra Leone.

Sugar-cane is cultivated, and seems suited to the climate, and the £3,500 worth of sugar imported by the Colony in 1890 may—the authors of the report state—be easily produced on the spot. Arrowroot grows exceedingly well; indeed, that of Sierra Leone is claimed to be the best in the world. But unfortunately the market has been spoilt because the Natives adulterated the flour with cassada and would not clean it properly. African flax or bow-string hemp is extremely common in the district. Its excellent character is well known, but so far the difficulty of preparing it for the market has not been overcome, and it is suggested that the processes of cleaning might be improved by first passing the leaves lengthwise through two horizontal rollers placed close together. Banana fibre is also referred to. As fibre, it can, perhaps, scarcely compete with other substances, but has scarcely yet had a fair practical trial. Usually the old stems are cut into four, lengthwise, the soft heart is taken out, and the pieces, after being left lying two or three days, are passed lengthwise through two horizontal rollers and washed. A tree yields about 4 lbs. of fibre, which is worth from £12 to £20 a ton. Waste stems might be profitably utilised in this way, though a plantation for fibre purposes could scarcely pay. There should be a large export trade in bananas, which sell at about 8d. a bunch.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley. The itinerant Liberian prophet, William Wade Harris, travelled through the Ivory Coast and the Apolonia District of the Gold Coast between 1910 and 1915 and converted some 100 000 people.

From the earliest days of the process of presenting Christianity to Africans, some converts had accepted the new faith lock, stock, and barrel. Others, on the other hand, accepted it on the basis of what they already knew, and understood Christianity in terms of the basic underlying concepts of African traditional religion, relating the message of the Church to their enduring religious needs.\nThus Christianity did not come merely to supplant traditional religious beliefs and practices, rather it came to supplement them. In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious. This is why we have termed it indigenous Christianity.\nUnderlying indigenous Christianity is an expression of religious crea› tivity and cultural integrity, and not a mere reaction, response or adaptation to outside stimuli, as some scholars are wont to assert. Usually, and with a few exceptions, the explanation for the emergence and proliferation of movements of indigenous Christianity has been derived from factors outside these movements themselves which has given them a functional reasonableness or a dysfunctional aberrant quality. Such interpretations may not be devoid of validity but they tend to overstress the role of outside factors in the emergence of these movements.

Some, however, paraded a superficial Westernization in their dress, their homes, their food and drink and their way of life. The missions' purpose was to create a middle class in order to cream off an elite, which would then be trained on Western lines, and would secure and expand the twoway flow of trade to and from the coast. The spread of civilization would be an incidental by-product which the palm-oil trade, limited to coastal transactions, could not achieve on its own. 47 Thus the Protestant missions, very much of this world, took on the role of reformers, which included interfering in political and military strategy. The Abeokuta missionaries suggested to England the making of a road to the sea, in order to speed up the barter trade - and the delivery of war material. They invoked the technical help of British troops against Dahomey. At Calabar their influence in the city-states secured by agree› ment the ending of local customs that they considered objectionable. From their position of strength, the missions did not object to the rival intrusion of Western administrations, but counterbalanced it by siding with or against the established trade. Around 1850 the missions, together with the traders and the political administration, became involved in an irreversible process leading to an early form of colonial rule. The appointment of consuls with expansionist views went hand in hand with armed blockades and the establishment of protectorates.

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches.

John Trotter, at Basingstoke.* The gentleman whose death occasioned the delivery of this sermon was Mr. James Grafton Hazeley, of Sierra Leone, an African, and a personal friend of Mr. Trotter. It was scarcely possible that such an occasion should be allowed to pass without some notice of the slanderous attacks lately made in England on missionaries in Africa, and on African converts to Christianity. Towards the close of his discourse Mr. Trotter says:—\n\n“As illustrative of the teachings of the text, let me now present you with a very brief account of the life and death of a Sierra Leone Christian. If you expect anything sensational, you will be disappointed, for he was a quiet, respectable, unassuming man, in whom we have a specimen of the quality of West African Christianity. Let this, therefore, be one reply, at least, to the foul charge, that Christianity is the curse of West Africa. It will be seen that he was not connected with our own churches, but was a member of the Wesleyan Mission Church—a church which has been, and still is, of immense good to the West Coast of Africa.”\n\nMr. Trotter then gives a concise and interesting biography of his deceased friend, who appears from early life to have been a sincere, consistent, and ardent Christian, and finishes with the following remark:—\n\n“Thus lived and thus died a Sierra Leone Christian. He was my own near neighbour in Freetown for some time. We have held sweet counsel together. His image is photographed on the tablet of my memory, never to be erased. When I was sick he visited me, and when I was in trouble he comforted me. Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my last end be like his. And here let me bear my testimony to the native Christians of Sierra Leone. With some few exceptions, greater Christian kindness I never met with from any people. I have seen them live, and I have seen them die. I have seen them in the villages, and in the larger towns. I have seen them taken out of the slave ship naked and down-troden, and I have seen them civilised, educated, and Christianized, and I have no hesitation in saying, that, taking into the account their antecedents, their religion will not lose anything by being contrasted with English Christianity. Any system, therefore, or any man who would rob them of the priceless boon of Christ and Him crucified, deserves to be buried under mountains of reproach. It would be infinite cruelty to dash the cup of salvation from their lips, now, when so many of them have tasted its sweetness; rather let them continue to drink and live for ever.\n\n“In conclusion, enough has been said to prove, that our African friend, Mr. James Grafton Hazeley, was a saint of the Most High God, that his death was safe, happy, and triumphant, and that such a death was precious or right dear in the sight of the Lord.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns.

In opening his address, the Archdeacon recalled the fact that five years ago, in the same building, he addressed a congregation on the same subject, and remarked that he had since then spent five years in East Africa, and was delighted to have the opportunity of speaking to an English audience of the further progress and development of the work. Thirty years ago the Universities\' Mission in Central Africa took its rise, owing its commencement to the statements of Dr. Livingstone. For the greater part of that time the mission work had been centred on the island of Zanzibar, and had taken the shape almost entirely of preparing students for the work of clergymen amongst their own races. An important epoch, however, had now arrived, and the first East African clergyman had been ordained in the course of the present year. At present the mission was spending its best energies in the training and foundation of native ministries, and they had as large a number of African helpers as they had European. The African helpers had remarkable steadfastness, and made very great headway in their work, and the mission had a large number of students who were pledged to seek orders at the proper time. He had come direct from the shores of Lake Nyassa, the most southern of the three great African lakes. It was the length of England, and had an average breadth of forty miles. It had a very large population on its shores, and in its centre, the headquarters of the mission was established on an island five miles long, three miles broad, and with a population of about 3,000 souls. With a large steamer and several boats the missionaries were able to cover a very large stretch of country, and amongst the tribes they came across no such things as idolatry or fetish were to be found. There were, however, the greatest superstitions and ramifications of witchcraft, and the ""\'ordeal\' was very paramount."" The natives had some belief in a creation, and in the personality of a great Being who had created them. Practically, they had no belief in God as an ethical Being, and they were really ignorant of sin, although they knew something of moral evil. They recognised murder and adultery as moral evils, and their rules punished these ""evils"" without recognising them as sins. They believed nothing about a future life, and although they had a great fear of death, that arose, not from fear of what was coming after death, but because of their intense liking for and great enjoyment of life. They did not believe in natural death, but always believed that death was caused by some living person. That belief resulted in dreadfully superstitious practises, which caused the death of some helpless person or persons. There was very great need for Christian work on the island. The mission had started schools for boys and girls. The great enemy was the indifference of the tribes to all religious matters. One of the great opportunities was the leisure of the people and their delight at being able to sit down and listen to something new. The results so far were not great, because heathenism was probably as old as the Flood, and could not be got rid of in a day; but the mission now had about sixty natives baptised and already communicants. They were really worthy and earnest Christians. All the great towns on the south of the island were being visited week by week, schools were maintained, and a very large number of children were being educated.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support?

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed. No wonder, then, that religion was, to the black man, invested with the garment of a trade, and this investment proved against the white man, in return, the greatest hindrance to progress and improvement."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Thomson agrees with Dr. Blyden as to the causes of these astonishing results.

Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual.""

Here, among the higher Bantu tribes south of the Congo, seems to be the region where Christian effort seems most likely to be crowned with success. The efforts of Moffat and Livingstone among the Bechuanas show how readily they embrace and retain the teaching of Christianity.

Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation.

1652,"Missionary activities in Africa were heavily influenced by financial constraints, reliance on colonial support, and strategic relocations to address inefficiencies and challenges such as famine.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of missionary activities in Africa, highlighting both alignments and discrepancies with the claim that these activities were influenced by financial constraints, reliance on colonial support, and strategic relocations. The General History of Africa emphasizes the influence and power of missionary societies, particularly in East Africa, where they initially operated independently of colonial governments, suggesting a limited reliance on colonial support during the pioneering phase. However, the text acknowledges strategic relocations, such as establishing colonies for freed slaves near slave caravans to combat the Arab slave trade, and notes that missionaries encouraged European intervention for security and economic opportunities, hinting at some reliance on colonial support. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly highlight financial constraints through urgent appeals for funds, such as the Famine Relief Fund, and the need for financial support for infrastructure. They also underscore reliance on colonial support, evidenced by the British Consul-General's oversight and the use of naval resources to aid missions. Strategic relocations are further detailed in the shift of mission fields and reorganization along the Niger River. The articles also address challenges like famine, necessitating increased funds and personnel, aligning with the claim. However, they do not explicitly cite colonial support as a primary influence, focusing more on internal challenges and organizational decisions. Together, these sources illustrate a complex interplay of factors influencing missionary activities, with strategic relocations and financial constraints being more prominently supported, while the role of colonial support varies between the sources.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights that relate to the claim about missionary activities in Africa. Firstly, the text highlights that missionary societies were indeed powerful and influential, particularly in East Africa, where they operated without the constraints of colonial governments. This suggests that their activities were not heavily reliant on colonial support, at least during the pioneering phase. However, the text does indicate that missionaries were strategic in their relocations, as they established colonies for freed slaves near slave caravans to combat the Arab slave trade, which aligns with the claim of strategic relocations. The text also mentions that missionaries encouraged European intervention, believing it would provide security and economic opportunities, which could imply a reliance on colonial support for achieving their goals. However, there is no direct mention of financial constraints influencing missionary activities or their response to challenges like famine. Therefore, while there are elements of strategic relocation and some reliance on colonial support, the claim about financial constraints and addressing inefficiencies such as famine is not directly supported by the textbook. This absence of information on financial constraints and famine-related challenges is a notable difference from the claim.","The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim that missionary activities in Africa were influenced by financial constraints, reliance on colonial support, and strategic relocations. Financial constraints are evident in the urgent appeals for funds, such as the Famine Relief Fund and the need for financial support to build school chapels and mission houses. The reliance on colonial support is highlighted by the mention of the British Consul-General's oversight and the use of naval resources, such as Her Majesty's ships, to aid missions. Strategic relocations are noted in the shift of mission fields from the Zambezi to Zanzibar and the reorganization of missions along the Niger River. Additionally, the articles discuss challenges like famine and the need for increased funds and personnel to sustain missions, which further supports the claim. However, the articles do not explicitly mention colonial support as a primary influence, focusing more on the internal challenges and organizational decisions within the missions themselves.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade.

In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule.

As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Forced labour was increased after 1927 by the installation of the administrative services at Niamey and by the extension of the railway. This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s.

The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others.

African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported.

For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion.

The creation of a surplus from an increase in agri› cultural production led to relatively rapid increase of population in certain areas such as Ovambo, Ovimbundu, Luba, the whole area in Zaire some 5° south of the Equator, etc. This, in turn, led to migratory movements away from other areas. This was further heightened by the varying effects of social and economic factors. Some economic factors encouraged the practice of gathering, such as the collection of ivory and wax by the Chokwe and this promoted the dispersion of people in the forest. Other economic factors, as often happened in river valleys for example, helped bring together a mixed population to create centres of trade and population concentration. Next to production, therefore, we must assess the degree of influence that world trade and economy had on the Central African region."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

We have taken under our charge all the cargoes of slaves which have been taken since my return. We have now, besides all our schools, nearly 100 adults, who are bringing our Mbweni estate into excellent order. They all attend at a mission service which is held specially for them on Sundays, and between twenty and thirty have come forward as candidates for holy baptism; they are now being regularly instructed by one of our native sub-deacons. The new coadjutors have enabled us to work effectively both our boys\' and our girls\' schools, and we have been able to separate the very little ones, so as to form a nursery. We have been disappointed in regard to our hospital department; but our hands are otherwise very full, and the officers and surgeons of the naval hospital on board Her Majesty\'s ship London are so kind and generous that one feels it much less than one would without them. On Monday next I hope to make two of our native scholars and three of our younger Europeans \'readers,\' so as to give them a regular standing in the Church, and enable them to feel that they are on their way to higher work for God. Our sub-deacons and these two intended readers have been most useful as interpreters in our mission services. We have on the ground attached to our boys\' school five couples of released slaves, who are all catechumens; and there is a brotherhood among the boys who have made it a special work of theirs to teach those adults to read. We have now a man who comes to our boys\' school at Kinngani whose father came from Scinde to Zanzibar many years ago. He is a goldsmith by trade. He says he has made an agreement to work half time only, so as to be able to come and learn of us half the day; so he comes out on his donkey and works away under one of our black pupil-teachers. From Usabara we hear that all is peaceful near Majila, and that the chief they recognize is becoming the strongest of his race. Immediately after the ordination of the readers I hope to be off for Majila. From the Nyassa country we hear that the whole of the east side of the lake is likely soon to be under the power of a single chief, rather a young man, named Makangila, who was the first of his race to drive back the Mariti or Mazitu. Captain G——, of Her Majesty\'s ship Nassau, kindly made inquiries for us at Lindy during his last cruise, and brought us a budget of very favourable news, all tending to show that our projected starting-point was really the best we could have chosen. Mr. J—— has had a trial walk with two coadjutors, and they found they could do more than they had expected. Chuma and Susi have engaged themselves to us, as they absolutely refuse to join any other party but ours. We are full of hope, but we sadly want men. The Nyassa mission cannot get on without another clergyman or two and several schoolmasters, nor can these be supported without considerably increased funds. Here at Mbweni we have the offer of a large piece of land, for which our dear friend West offered 600l., and now the owner will take 350l. It adjoins our land, and I think we must have it. No one who has not been on the spot can judge of the value of our central situation. We are under the eye of the British Consul-General, we are open to the criticisms of everybody, and one chief can overlook several distinct establishments. The catechumens\' classes and mission preachings among our released slaves are the most valuable training our European students can have. Only this last week sixteen slaves were taken by Her Majesty\'s ship London, and Major Smith wished to send them to Mombas, but could find no good means of sending, so that he was very glad to send them here.""'}, {'id': 3423, 'article_title': 'AN EXPLORATION FROM CAMEROONS RIVER.', 'full_section_title': 'AN EXPLORATION FROM CAMEROONS RIVER.', 'last_edit_date': '09-01-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1877#article-24', 'issue_date': '01_10_1877', 'content': '""I am taking steps to procure some Kroomen for carriers, so that when the dry season opens, I may be able to make a journey without depending upon Cameroons men, who are so likely to disappoint one.

Six Kroomen will cost for hire during one year—wages about 45l., food a similar sum, passages from their home here (about 1,200 miles distant), and back again, about 30l. All the hard work on this part of the coast is performed by these men; they work all the cargo and boats in the oil trade. There are about 120 of them in our river, all engaged for one year. I think if I can succeed in getting these men and stores, I shall, with two Dualla men whom I can trust, make an attempt to leave here in October next, and go eastwards. At present the rainy season precludes the possibility of travelling. September generally sees the end of the heaviest rains. I shall also try to get a couple of asses from Teneriffe; they will cost about 30l., together with passage here.

At present I know our Society is not in a position to authorize increased expenditure, but I hope something will be done by ourselves, as well as the other sections of the Church, in this work. At present it would be rash to get together large sums of money and fit out expeditions, even though we were able to do it.

It seems that a much larger proportion of the African agents than we were aware of have failed in one way or another, and have either left or been disconnected during the thirty years the mission has been carried on. Most of these have been subordinate teachers, whose very names were unknown to us in England; but some have been ordained men—of which class no less than five had been disconnected prior to the present year. The most serious steps in this respect were recorded in the annual report for 1883-4, in which the fact that the Bishop had admitted some of his men too readily to holy orders was commented on.\n\nJust twelve months ago, the African missionary in charge of the Upper Niger Mission (Archdeacon Henry Johnson) was requested by the Committee to withdraw from Lokoja. He did so forthwith, and has since been at Lagos awaiting further instructions. At the same time, some of the stations that had been reckoned to the Upper Niger were transferred to the Lower Niger Mission, with three ordained Africans who were in charge of them; and two other ordained Africans in the reduced Upper district were sent down to stations in the Delta.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country. Some constitutions acclimatize with difficulty, others never; while some fall victims to fever as soon as they reach their destination, and before commencing work.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GAMBIA, WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Appeal of a Native African Clergyman on behalf of his Fellow-Countrymen.\n\nThe Rev.

To these he ministers, and superintends an organization similar to that found in any well-worked parish in England. The congregation is occasionally increased by the visit of one of Her Majesty’s ships. He has also the spiritual charge of the convicts in the gaol and the inmates of the Colonial Hospital. In connection with the Colonial Church at Bathurst there is now a congregation of 200 Christian worshippers and about eighty communicants. The church can only accommodate 250. In addition to the work connected with his chaplaincy, Mr. Nicol recognizes the claims of the heathen upon the Christian Church, and has started three missions for those in and around the town of Bathurst; but as yet has been unable to reach the neighbouring tribes—namely, the Jolas, the Sérérés, the Polos, and the Mandingoes. For upwards of 600 miles higher up the River Gambia, on either bank of that noble river, one mercantile firm alone has seventy trading factories. There is not one resident missionary preaching the Gospel to the people trading with these merchants. Merchant clerks and other traders go up and down the country for the purpose of trade, but there is not one Christian teacher, European or native, who has taken up his residence among the people to learn their language and to instruct them. It is this sad state of things Mr. Nicol is anxious to remedy. He has formed at the Gambia a Native Church Missionary Association, and by the aid of his congregation and the merchants on the spot, has raised 50l. and built a small school chapel on the outskirts of Bathurst which is open daily for service and evangelistic meetings, and where a lay-helper is rendering efficient service. He has also been invited to build another chapel at Albreda, eighty miles up the river.\n\nThe present appeal is for funds to build School Chapels and Mission Houses at several of the most important trading stations. To do this satisfactorily, 1,000l. must be raised; and to maintain the necessary mission agents and teachers, at least 500l. per annum is required.\n\nIt may be added that the Church Missionary Society would rejoice to see this work advanced, though unable themselves to undertake the responsibility of any fresh expenditure in this part of the world; and that the Rev. R. C.

According to accounts which from time to time have been received in England, the missionaries have had to undergo terrible hardships, and the latest information shows that those of the party who are alive are in a most deplorable condition. The party, on leaving Liverpool, included men, women, and children, and were evidently totally unacquainted with the nature of the country they were going to. In a very short time after their arrival many of them were stricken down with fever, and soon death terminated the sufferings of several. The missionaries appear to have been ill-provided with funds, and although two or three of the party have returned home, they were only enabled to do so by the consideration of the English steamship companies trading to the port. A gentleman who has been engaged in trading at St. Paul de Loanda for some time past has just arrived in England, and from him some very sad facts have been obtained. So badly off were the party at latest accounts that they had sent a request to the trading houses to be given the leavings of their tables. Many of the party, if they acted on the promptings of their own feelings, would return to America, but they were afraid of being accused of acting in their own interests, and abandoning the noble work they went out to pursue.

One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns.

We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support? Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

He worked to set up a mission - about which he wrote the above lament - along lines he had observed among American blacks: 'an industrial mission in which Africans were trained in the arts and crafts as well as taught Christianity'. 32 Bishop Coppin assessed black American Church efforts in Africa in an address to the 1916 AME General Conference. He noted that: The home church has built, and assisted in building churches and school houses in Africa, West and South. Many students have been trained in our schools at home, largely or wholly at the expense of the Church ... [because] we have not been indifferent to the call to duty by our kindred beyond the seas; to recognize the debt we owe to the foreign field in general and to Africa in particular ... for the redemption of Africa where millions are yet in darkness, and to grasp the outstretched hand of Ethiopia. 33 Notwithstanding the resistance by white South African political and church authorities, the AME connections sown by Turner, deepened by Dwane, and given firm institutional grounding by the Coppins and the Maxekes produced a veritable cornucopia of African students matriculating at American schools. Similarly, in British Central Africa, and West Africa, African students were encouraged and often subsidized by American black churches. The latter student sojourns set the stage for a major new phase in African and Afro-American interaction in the colonial period, one which had great consequences for subsequent African nationalist movements in the mid-twentieth century.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began. As European nations increasingly became interested in the acquisition of African territories, the missionaries paved the way in some areas of Africa and served, quite consciously, as agents for European colonialism. Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

But it certainly is true that recent work on African religion in Southern Rhodesia shows that its relationship to resistance cannot have been so straightforward as I had supposed. It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements.

Nobody is more painfully conscious of this than we are ourselves. The native must ever be more powerful than the European. They have trodden every step of the way from heathen darkness to Gospel light. Every trial is known to them by actual experience. Fellow feeling gives them power of truest sympathy.

Mr. Farler cannot be blamed for carrying the war into Dr. Lenz's own territory. Travellers are the favourites of the period; and in no career are the prizes more abundant and brilliant. All the world admires the traveller. The missionary, whom few admire, and certainly not the general public, may think it hard that a casual visitor, whom probably he has aided and befriended, should be listened to as if he were Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools when he informs Europe that African missionaries are worthy people who do a great deal of harm. An Englishman who exiles himself to Central Africa enjoys few of the compensations within the reach of the African traveller. He suffers a hundredfold the privations, and he has to wrestle with a barbarism which may be perverted into something worse by undigested education and proselytism. It would not have been surprising had an African missionary, who has resigned the advantages of civilization and attractive prospects in his own land, infused some bitterness into his retort to a rather too magisterial condemnation of his whole object in life. But the real question remains, whether the charge be true, whoever brings it. The opinion of most who examine the evidence will probably be that any large _dictum_ to the purport that missionary work in Central Africa is all illusory is a gross exaggeration. From unimpeachable testimony it is clear that missionary settlements in the country are bearing fruit, whether much or little. Negroes are actually redeemed from debasing sensuality, superstition, and indolence. There are missionary villages in Central Africa which would compare favourably with many English hamlets. The picture Mr. Farler draws of his own station is corroborated by a body of independent testimony, and it demonstrates the accomplishment of marvellous results in a dozen years. Attention there is fully paid to the primary duty of teaching the native the virtue of regular industry, which he had unlearnt through the excessive complaisance of nature. So long as the effort is sustained there can be little doubt that the beneficial effects will go on, and that the individuals subjected to this process will lapse no oftener than professing Christians in Europe and America.\n\nThere seems to be no ground for questioning the soundness of the influence of British Protestant Missions, so far as its scope extends.

It is desired that means may be provided for the training and employment of a much larger number of native African agents; and that at important centres, hereafter to be selected, schools or institutions should be formed for that purpose, to be commenced and sustained by an appropriation from the Jubilee Fund. In contemplation of the vastness of the field of labour in Africa it will be admitted that a large amount may with propriety be consecrated to this service.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—In your March number you inserted an article, ""A Ga Sabbato School"" in our town, founded by some young gentlemen. It was a characteristic of our town that scarcely anybody knew about it, till the notice of it was read in your valuable paper. We found it just as was stated, and feel ourselves most thankful to these our fellow citizens who have taken this task upon their shoulders; and it is the more to be acknowledged, as these young gentlemen are clerks, having work to do through the whole week, and therefore desire a Sunday afternoon recreation. May their work prosper!\n\nBut it was not commendable to see how other people tried to make use of this work. Scarcely did the Rev. Shamfelt read that article than he came to seek the school. Luckily none of the ten or twelve persons whom he asked could give any information about it, and he was thus obliged to go back without having effected his object. And that was well. Our reverend seemed to have a great desire to mix himself up with that undertaking, and it would not have been long before we should have seen a long report of his zealous love to Africa, and the real undertakers...\n\nwould be thus forgotten. Indeed, we have enough of such reports of dubious credibility, only to do homage to self-love, and are therefore glad to be spared now and then therewith.\n\nBut if our missionaries really want to do something for the country, we should think there are opportunities enough. On our small Gold Coast, with about 200,000 inhabitants, are two missions, the Wesleyan Mission and the Basil Mission; we may say three, as there is also the Bremen Mission, occupying a bordering line on the Slave Coast. We are told that it is now more than fifty years since the missionaries have been on this coast, and that the missionaries are greatly complaining of seeing no success in their work. But we found it otherwise. There is very much done in these fifty years, especially in the second to the fourth decenary. The missionaries know themselves how many congregations they have, and how many members of whom they cannot say that all are chaff. Besides there are lots of healthy houses built, the whole Bible, and other useful books are translated into these languages, so that our present missionaries need no more ""to pick up the languages word by word from the thick lips of the negro with great difficulty!"" A whole staff of native assistants is formed, whose help our missionaries should better acknowledge. We are sure there would be more success if they continue their works in the same manner, instead of sitting and lamenting the incorrigibleness of the negroes, and criticising the works of the zealous predecessors of theirs in a most invidious way.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-04-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'in the printing-office are not recognized by the other missionaries, excepting the one under whose direction he labours. Why so? Because ministerial discord and dissension are at the bottom of it. One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Baptist Mission at the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Doubtless some mistakes have been made, as was inevitable through the novelty of the circumstances.

But it must be remembered that Mr. Saker found nothing to his hand; he had to plan, to conceive, to construct everything, with few or no resources on the spot. After the fullest consideration I could give to these adverse statements, and after inspecting the presumed evidences of this waste, it is my deliberate judgment that, while in some cases the statements have been exaggerations, in others, when the destructive effects of climate are considered—the interruptions occasioned by illness—the thefts of the native population—the slow and inadequate workmanship of the men Mr. Saker has instructed—the delay arising from want of materials to finish the work, and for which resort must be had to the stores and workshops of England—Mr. Saker has done his best, has never wilfully wasted the Society\'s property, and has not been guilty of extravagance. On the contrary, I marvel at the amount of work, both secular and religious, accomplished in the twenty-one years of Mr. Saker\'s toil. He has exhibited an endurance, a devotedness in the Master\'s service, an heroic struggle with perils and difficulties on every hand, which few missionaries are called to exercise, and which his successors will not have to encounter.""\n\nYour Committee are deeply interested in the testimony borne by Dr. Underhill to the character and devotedness of the junior brethren.

For the Lord\'s sake, for the sake of the salvation of these savage and barbarous tribes, they gladly encounter numerous perils, and fearlessly meet the dangers which a residence among an uncivilised people involves.

Who but those who have already put their hands to the plough; who but those who with more or less of heartiness and sincere desire to stem the tide of moral and material misery—to staunch the bleeding wounds—of Africa, have already made some effort on her behalf in the past.

Francis Pinnock (Baptist Missionary) and family to England, whence they will embark for Jamaica, the native island of Mr. and Mrs. Pinnock. After eighteen years\' absence from their country and friends, they have at last obtained the sanction of the Committee of the Baptist Missionary Society to return home. During those eighteen years Mr. and Mrs. Pinnock have gained the esteem and affection of all classes of people at Fernando Po, Cameroons, and especially at Victoria, where they laboured during fifteen years of their sojourn in Africa, and whence they have come to this place to embark on one of the mail steamers for England. As an evidence of the high esteem in which Mr. Pinnock was held by his people at Victoria, and by the surrounding peoples, I subjoin herewith a copy of an address presented to him on the occasion of a public gathering, just a week before his leaving Victoria. The address was read by the Rev. Robert Smith (Mr. Pinnock\'s successor), at the request of Mr. Brew, senior deacon of the Church. A small testimonial in cash—the real amount of which I am ignorant of—was likewise presented to Mr. Pinnock on the same occasion, for which he publicly expressed his thanks.\n\nMy object in writing upon this subject, Mr. Editor, is twofold: first, to correct a certain error current among us Africans—viz., that a black man, however elevated his character, can never entirely succeed in commanding the respect, affection, and confidence of his fellow black men; secondly, to show the desirability of employing a larger amount of native element than is at present employed for the evangelization of Africa. ""If Africa is to be evangelized, she must be evangelized mainly by her own sons."" The African is better able to withstand the effects of his native climate than the European. Mr. Fuller, another of our black missionaries, was _twenty-eight years_, at least, in Africa before he re-visited Jamaica, his native island, for the first time, a few years ago.

If we have checked some evils, prepared the way for the removal of others, and effected some real good, we regard these results as merely the first stones in our structure of African improvement. We receive from so many quarters in Africa the gratifying assurances that this journal is exercising great power for good, that we now claim from the friends of Africa, as a right, that support which we first solicited, in hope that we might possibly advance by our labours the great cause of the industrial regeneration of Africa. It is not too much to say that we have prepared the way for those commercial companies which are now coming full of promise into the great field of undeveloped African commerce. We have given Africa a voice among influential people in Great Britain. We have made her cries for help, that she can and will so richly repay, heard by those who have the power and the knowledge that are needed for successful efforts in her great fields of produce. But when we compare her gigantic evils with the elements of good directed against them, we feel that the work of her regeneration is one that demands the devotion of our life, and in which that life, by God\'s blessing, shall be spent. We can do nothing, however, without proper support. It is only by its being subscribed for, and read, that this journal can prove effective.

I issued handbills on Saturday evening, calling a special meeting for Monday night, not stating for what it was called. Nobody knew about it, and curiosity was excited. The large schoolroom was filled with people, and after opening the meeting I at once told them if they wanted me to go on with the work, I must have more money. I should say that we had already collected over 200l. The people were anxious that the work should go on, of which they there and then gave practical proof. One man got up and said he would give two guineas; another, who had given me seven guineas before, gave 20l; another, who before, had given 6l. 6s., gave twenty-three guineas. This sent some of the people almost off their heads; but when the uproar had ceased promises came thick and fast. Six, five, four, three guineas, and sums ranging from sixpence, soon brought up a grand total promised (and some paid) in that meeting of over 120l.
